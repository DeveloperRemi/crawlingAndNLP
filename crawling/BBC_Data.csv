Air raid sirens in Kyiv as EU-Ukraine summit starts,,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-64509741
Ukraine grid attacks: Engineers race to restore electricity supplies,"With a dusting of fresh winter snow settling around us and the crackle of electricity loud in the wires over our heads, Michael runs his gloved fingers over golf ball-sized holes in the crippled hulk of a huge transformer.  ""Here, and here, and here,"" he says, as he shows where shrapnel from a Russian missile punctured the transformer's thick sides.  Sharp metal fragments of the missile lie on the ground nearby.  Along the way, other transformers as big as bungalows are disappearing behind protective cocoons of concrete and sandbags. Above us loom the high, forbidding, Soviet-era walls of the power plant's vast turbine hall. Panes of glass for half a mile shattered by explosions from the 12 missiles that have landed here since mid-October. For all the well-publicised damage, the authorities don't want us to reveal too much. Since October, when temperatures began to plummet, Russia has been using strikes on Ukraine's power grid to force the civilian population into submission. For two weeks, the BBC watched engineers and technicians who run the network racing to repair the damage and keep electricity flowing across the country. We have been asked not to reveal the precise location of some of the facilities we visit. We've also altered the names of some of the officials we meet. ""Every time the equipment is damaged, it gets us all right here in our soul,"" Michael says, tapping his chest. Some of these huge rust-stained machines are older than the men who run them. But for Michael, the plant's manager, they're his babies. ""It's our life. Our second family."" Michael sent his first family - his wife and teenage son - to Europe early in the war. Their dog, a playful golden retriever, now accompanies him to work every day.  The transformer - 130 tonnes of twisted metal, dangling wires and scorch marks where cooling oil leaked and caught fire - is not easy to replace. ""I know how much effort it takes to build this, to install and launch it,"" says Michael, a veteran of 30 years in this industry. ""It's not something you can buy in a store."" The same goes for the turbines inside - monstrous, deafening mechanical dinosaurs, churning and hissing away at the heart of the plant. They're hugely impressive machines, but there's little time to admire them, as the air raid siren sounds for the third time this morning.  In a well-practised drill, most of the plant's staff head for the bunkers. The atmosphere is relaxed - such interruptions are commonplace - until word starts to spread of a fresh wave of Russian attacks on the power grid. A sister plant in the west has been hit. A picture circulates of fire raging in a turbine hall much like the one we were in just now. Then, even through the thick concrete walls of our underground retreat, we hear a distant explosion. There's tension in the room as the men and women check their phones. A crowded apartment block, not far away, has been hit. The scene, when we arrive soon after dark, is chaotic and desperate. A missile has torn a gaping hole in the middle of the nine-storey building. Thick smoke, pierced by flashlights, rises from a pile of rubble. Dozens of rescue workers and volunteers are working frantically to find survivors.  The death toll, which mounts inexorably over the coming days, is one of the highest of the war so far. Mothers, fathers, children. Whole families. At the power station, the following morning, the mood is bleak. Everyone believes the missile was aimed at them.  ""We need to stop the attacks,"" Michael says. ""We need to close the sky over Ukraine."" Until that happens, Ukraine's entire grid will be in jeopardy. Especially substations, which have borne the brunt of Moscow's wrath. These vital hubs, where transformers turn high voltage electricity from power plants into lower mains voltage that businesses and homes can use, have been targeted over and over again.  Each hit deprives hundreds of thousands of households of electricity, forcing the state energy company, Ukrenergo, to find ways of diverting power along alternative routes. The firm agrees to give us rare access to a substation, on condition that we do not reveal its location.  On the day we visit, a frigid wind whistles across hundreds of miles of open farmland and a watery winter sun pokes through the clouds. The sprawling facility, with its maze of pylons, cables and imposing machinery, feels remote and impersonal, but around 15 million Ukrainians depend on it for power. It's been hit six times with missiles and drones.  The manager, Serhiy, who's worked here for decades, surveys his shattered empire. Two of the devastated transformers are among the largest in the world, weighing more than 300 tonnes. The specialised steel innards of one of them have been torn out and lie folded on the ground, like the leaves of a clumsily discarded book. Data collected by Kyiv's Energy Industry Research Centre (EIRC) suggests that about100 substation transformers, of various sizes, have been hit since October. Due to their cost and the many months it takes to manufacture them, not a single one has yet been replaced Serhiy points out the gaping hole in the administration building, where a bookcase and dangling light bulb are pretty much all that's left of his office. He watched the destruction from 500m away, as a ""kamikaze"" drone tore into the building, wrecking the control room and taking the substation offline. ""We knew it would happen sooner or later,"" he says. Repairing the damage will take years. ""They know perfectly well why this facility is important for Ukraine. That's why they decided to destroy it."" You must feel angry all the time, I suggest. Serhiy is a man of few words. ""Hate,"" he replies simply. ""Hate towards those who came to kill my people."" With Western help and several months of experience, Ukraine is getting much better at defending itself. Most of the drones fired by Russia are now shot down before reaching their targets, and most of the missiles too. Data from EIRC shows fewer than 10% of the 1,400 missiles and drones fired at Ukraine's civilian infrastructure since early October have actually destroyed key components of the grid. But it's still a scramble for the country's engineers to keep up.  Following reports of overnight shelling near the southern city of Nikopol, we join a repair team from DTEK, the country's largest private energy company, in the middle of a field, overlooking the Dnipro River. The sound of artillery booms across the wide, silver expanse of water. The battle lines aren't far from here. The damage looks slight. A couple of shallow craters in the field and a few low voltage lines draped across Ukraine's famously dark soil. But the nearby village of Vyschetarasivka is without power, yet again. The men, some wearing flak jackets, get to work, scaling the poles and twisting wires together. After the colossal scale of the power plant and substation, today's work feels almost delicate. ""This is pure terror,"" says chief engineer Volodymyr. ""Just terrorising the population, causing maximum damage to the energy infrastructure."" Volodymyr would much prefer to keep busy modernising and improving Ukraine's electricity network. But he'll keep the repairs going just as long as the Russians keep firing. ""We feel a bit hopeless, not being able to influence the situation,"" he says. ""But if necessary, we'll come back and repair the lines every day. The people need light."" In the village, half emptied by almost a year of war, the power cuts have become more frequent and less predictable.  ""Electricity affects pumps and boilers,"" says Bohdan, as he arrives with empty bottles to collect water. ""If there's no power, people freeze. And we have to buy water from the store. If you have a generator and petrol, you can survive. Otherwise, I don't know how older people do it."" The mayor, Oleksandr Sivak, wrapped up against the biting east wind, says those who can't stand it have already left.  ""As long as we're alive and have even a bit of electricity and water, we'll keep on living,"" he says. The sound of artillery is getting closer, forcing Oleksandr to drop to his knees. It's a sensible precaution, the result of long months of constant danger. Downriver, beyond Nikopol, a town shelled day and night from Russian positions to the south, we meet another team repairing power lines, reconnecting communities under Russian occupation until the autumn. Here, amid the debris of recent conflict - a rocket lodged in the pavement, shattered headstones in a cemetery and a score of recently dug graves - the DTEK team must proceed with caution. The use of anti-personnel mines along former front lines adds another element of hazard. Up ahead, State Emergency Service personnel are walking slowly along a line of pylons, inspecting the undulating ground for discarded ordnance. ""We feel like semi-soldiers,"" says team leader Fyodor, another grizzled veteran of the industry, as he pauses for a cigarette. Above him, colleagues in a cherry picker are hard at work, hauling a new high voltage line up to a pylon. ""Sometimes we go on trips to restore power in an area. Then they shell us and we have to go back. It's a race."" For all the hardship we observe during two weeks on the road in Ukraine, it's a race the engineers seem to be winning. People grumble, for sure, when the lights go out, their apartments grow cold and the water stops flowing. Hospitals have reported higher numbers of road traffic accidents as motorists move around darkened city roads. But away from the front lines, people have adjusted to the lack of electricity much as they have to the air raid sirens and occasional explosions: with pragmatism and ingenuity.  On city streets, in the middle of a blackout, portable generators churn away on pavements and down alleyways. In Kyiv, for all the midwinter gloom, shops are open, restaurants full. Walk into any motorway service station and the same scene greets you every time: brightly lit, well-stocked shelves, muzak playing and the hand-driers in immaculate toilets blasting out hot air.  You could be forgiven for thinking you were anywhere else in Europe. And that's the way those in charge of Ukraine's energy grid would like it.  ""It was our aim for many years, to integrate into the European grid,"" says Oleksandr Kharchenko, EIRC's director. ""And now it's happened."" Russia's energy war, just like its military campaign, is having the exact opposite of its desired effect. Far from separating Ukraine from Europe, it's binding it ever closer, in a process that mirrors the country's gradual integration into the Western military alliance, Nato. Ukraine officially declared its desire to join the European grid in 2017. It's typically a lengthy process - it took Turkey 11 years - but when Vladimir Putin decided to invade last year, the process accelerated dramatically. In February last year Ukraine disconnected itself from the Russian grid for the first time, to test the country's ability to manage in ""isolated mode"" during the winter months, when demand for electricity peaks.  The disconnect, the first of two, was due to take place on the 18th and last just three days. The Russians requested a delay. It eventually happened at 01:00 on 24 February.  ""We disconnected four hours before the invasion started, from this very building,"" Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, CEO of Ukrenergo, told me at his Kyiv headquarters. ""When the invasion started, it became obvious we would not reconnect."" Was the invasion timed to coincide with Ukraine's moment of maximum isolation?  ""I absolutely believe the war started on the 24th just because of this,"" Kharchenko says. Infrastructure was targeted in the early days, but not enough to plunge the country into chaos. ""They thought we would have a national blackout,"" Kharchenko says. ""That this would cause panic, no connection, no government, no-one knows where the president is, how to connect with your siblings, your parents."" None of this happened. Amid mounting speculation about Moscow's intentions in the weeks before 24 February, the company had quietly moved the grid's main control room to an undisclosed location further west. A second experimental disconnect was scheduled for June, when demand is typically low. If everything went according to plan, Ukraine would finally join the European grid in October 2023.  But with industry shutting down and millions of Ukrainians fleeing the country, electricity consumption plummeted by 40% within three days of the invasion. Ukrenergo asked its European partners if it could bring forward the second test. ""They looked at us like we were crazy,"" Kharchenko, who advises Ukrenergo, recalls. But by 16 March, it was all done. With Russian troops still menacing the capital, Ukraine connected to the European grid, a year-and-a-half ahead of schedule. For a few months, Ukraine was even able to export its excess electricity.  That all stopped in October. Since then, the country has had to make do with half the electricity it had before 24 February. But it hasn't collapsed. ""I think the reason is the same why they cannot win on the battlefield,"" Kudrytskyi says. ""Because we were prepared and we were resolved to win this particular battle."" Ukraine has fought many battles over the past year. In a sprawling, hilltop cemetery on the edge of the eastern city of Dnipro, hundreds of blue and yellow Ukrainian flags flap noisily in the stiff breeze. Rows of freshly dug graves await the latest casualties from the front, 100 miles to the east. Each cross, unmarked grave and rippling flag drives home the desperate cost of this war. But overhead, rising against a fiery sunset, pylons march away across the landscape.  Ukraine is still connected.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64467774
"Ukraine war: 80 years on, we are facing German tanks again - Putin","Vladimir Putin has compared Russia's invasion of Ukraine to the fight against Nazi Germany, in a speech to mark the 80th anniversary of the conclusion of the Battle of Stalingrad. Citing Germany's decision to send tanks to Ukraine, the Russian president said history was repeating itself. ""It's unbelievable but true,"" he said. ""We are again being threatened by German Leopard tanks."" Germany is one of many countries helping Ukraine defend its territory. Russia launched its bloody, full-scale invasion almost one year ago, prompting Western countries to send weapons and aid to the government in Kyiv. Speaking in Volgograd - the modern name for Stalingrad - Mr Putin hinted that he could seek to move beyond conventional weapons. ""Those who hope to defeat Russia on the battlefield do not understand, it seems, that a modern war with Russia will be very different for them,"" the 70-year-old leader said. ""We are not sending our tanks to their borders, but we have the means to respond. It won't be limited to the use of armoured hardware. Everyone must understand this.""  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to elaborate on Mr Putin's comments but did tell reporters that ""as new weapons are delivered by the collective West, Russia will make greater use of its potential to respond"".  Mr Putin was in Volgograd to mark the anniversary of the end of World War Two's Battle of Stalingrad, which saw the Soviet army capture nearly 91,000 German troops in a major turning point of the war. Over a million people perished in the battle - the bloodiest of the conflict.  Volgograd was temporarily renamed Stalingrad for the day to mark the anniversary, and earlier this week a new bust of the former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was unveiled.  Stalin - who led the Soviet Union between 1924 and his death in 1953 - was accused of orchestrating a famine in Ukraine between 1932-33.  The event - called the Holodomor by Ukrainians - killed an estimated five million people and was recognised as a genocide earlier this week in Bulgaria.  Throughout the war in Ukraine, Mr Putin has falsely sought to present Russia's invasion as a battle against nationalists and Nazis - who he says are leading the Kyiv government.  And he returned to the theme throughout his speech.  ""Now, unfortunately, we see that the ideology of Nazism, already in its modern guise, in its modern manifestation, again creates direct threats to the security of our country,"" he said.  ""Again and again we have to repel the aggression of the collective West."" But he vowed that while it was ""unbelievable but true"" that Russia was again being threatened by German tanks, Moscow had an answer for any country that threatened it.  Berlin has agreed to send 14 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, prompting the Russian company Fores - a Urals-based energy industry firm - to offer five million roubles (£58,250) to the first Russian soldier to destroy or capture one.  Mr Putin also laid flowers at the grave of the Soviet marshal who oversaw the defence of the city, and visited the main memorial complex where he led a moment of silence for those that died in the battle. Meanwhile, thousands of Volgograd residents lined the city's streets to watch a military parade.  As planes roared overhead, modern and World War Two-era tanks rolled along the centre of the city. Some of the modern vehicles were marked with the letter Z, which has become the symbol of Russia's invasion.  Local media reported that regional Governor Andrey Bocharov - who accompanied Mr Putin to the memorial complex - was not at the parade. He had not been seen since 24 January, leading to speculation that he was isolating before meeting the president.  Elsewhere, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia was preparing to take ""revenge"" against the West for aiding Ukraine.  ""Now Russia is concentrating its forces. We all know that. It is preparing to try to take revenge, not only against Ukraine, but against a free Europe and the free world,"" Mr Zelensky said in Kyiv.  Speaking alongside EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Mr Zelensky said Russia was ""increasing the pace of adaptation to sanctions"" and urged the EU leader to impose additional restrictions on the Russian economy.  Later, addressing the National Prayer Breakfast in the US via videolink, Mr Zelensky thanked US President Joe Biden for his support and set Ukrainian forces a goal of defeating the Russian invasion in the next year.  ""We must do everything we can together so that next year - on the first Thursday of February - we will be able to pray simply with thanks for the obtained salvation from evil,"" Mr Zelensky said.

Ukraine war: Kharkiv mayor thanks Oxford for support,"The mayor of a war-torn Ukrainian city has thanked the people of Oxford for their support since the Russian invasion. In a video message to Oxford City Council, Ihor Terekhov, the mayor of Kharkiv, said his city had ""survived and overcome"". Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, has suffered heavy damage in the conflict. Oxford's deputy leader, Ed Turner, said in a reply that he hoped for ""happier times ahead"". In his address, delivered in front of a Ukrainian flag, Mr Terekhov highlighted the similarities between the two cities with ""long university traditions"". ""Kharkiv and Oxford have a lot in common, for they are centres of education and science, culture and art of their regions. ""Despite the huge losses and damage, we are confident about the future,"" he said. Ukraine successfully pushed Russian forces back from the outskirts of Kharkiv last spring and the city, in the north-east of the country, was also targeted by missile strikes in December aimed at disrupting energy supplies. In his reply, Mr Turner said: ""I have been as humbled and impressed by Ukraine's resistance as I have been saddened by the appalling nature of Russia's attacks on Ukrainian territory and Ukrainian civilians. ""I am especially heartened that so many people in our city have opened their homes to people from Ukraine, while others are giving of their time to assist those who are here."" Oxford ended it twinning arrangements with the Russian city of Perm in the Ural Mountains in March 2022 in protest at Vladimir Putin's invasion. Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

'I apologise to the whole Ukrainian nation' - former Russian army officer,,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64495520
"Ukraine war: Russia planning 24 February offensive, Ukrainian defence minister says","Ukraine's defence minister has said Russia is preparing a major new offensive, and warned that it could begin as soon as 24 February. Oleksii Reznikov said Moscow had amassed thousands of troops and could ""try something"" to mark the anniversary of the initial invasion last year.  The attack would also mark Russia's Defender of the Fatherland Day on 23 February, which celebrates the army.  Meanwhile, three people have died in an attack on the city of Kramatorsk. Eight others were wounded in the city in Donetsk region after a Russian missile struck a residential building, the provincial governor said.  The toll is expected to rise as rescuers comb through the wreckage. ""The only way to stop Russian terrorism is to defeat it,"" Mr Zelensky wrote on social media about the attack. ""By tanks. Fighter jets. Long-range missiles."" Ukraine has recently renewed calls for fighter jets to help protect itself from air attacks after Germany, the US and the UK agreed to send them tanks.  Mr Reznikov said Moscow had mobilised some 500,000 troops for the potential offensive. In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a general mobilisation of some 300,000 conscripted troops, which he said was necessary to ensure the country's ""territorial integrity"".  But Mr Reznikov suggested that the true figure recruited and deployed to Ukraine could be far higher.  ""Officially they announced 300,000 but when we see the troops at the borders, according to our assessments it is much more,"" he told the French BFM network. The BBC cannot independently verify this figure.  Russia has claimed recent gains in the eastern Donbas region and its forces say they are moving in on the front-line town of Bakhmut after a battle that has lasted months and led to heavy loss of life on both sides. Last month, Russian mercenaries and regular soldiers seized the nearby town of Soledar and on Wednesday a Russian-appointed official, Yan Gagin, said Bakhmut was ""operationally surrounded"". The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) recently said that Moscow could seek to ""undertake a decisive action"" and launch a ""big offensive"" in the east.  Mr Reznikov said Ukraine's commanders would seek to ""stabilise the front and prepare for a counter-offensive"" ahead of the rumoured Russian advance.  ""I have faith that the year 2023 can be the year of military victory,"" he said, adding that Ukraine's forces ""cannot lose the initiative"" they have achieved in recent months.  The defence minister was in France to strike a deal to purchase additional MG-200 air defence radars, which he said would ""significantly increase the capacity of the armed forces to detect air targets, including winged and ballistic missiles, and drones of various types"".  Mr Reznikov's comments come as Ukrainian intelligence alleges that President Putin has ordered his forces to seize the Donbas before the end of spring.  But speaking on Monday, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that there were no indications that Mr Putin had limited his military goals to seizing eastern regions of Ukraine. ""That they are actively acquiring new weapons, more ammunition, ramping up their own production, but also acquiring more weapons from other authoritarian states like Iran and North Korea,"" Mr Stoltenberg said.  ""And most of all, we have seen no sign that President Putin has changed his overall goal of this invasion - that is to control a neighbour, to control Ukraine. So as long as this is the case, we need to be prepared for the long haul."" Meanwhile, Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar said that intense fighting was continuing in the Donbas region, where Russian forces and Wagner Group mercenaries have been trying to take the town of Bakhmut.  She added that Moscow's troops were also trying to seize Lyman - the former Russian logistics hub that Ukrainian troops retook in October.  ""Russian troops are actively trying to reach the borders of Donetsk and Luhansk regions,"" she wrote on the Telegram messaging app. ""Our soldiers defend every centimetre of Ukrainian land,"" she said.  Speaking on Wednesday night, Mr Zelensky warned that the situation on the front lines of the conflict was testing his forces.  ""There is a certain increase in the occupiers' offensive actions at the front - in the east of our country, Mr Zelensky said. ""The situation is becoming even more severe."" While the Wagner group has claimed it has been heavily involved in Russia's recent advances in the east, a former commander who fled to Norway has told Reuters that he witnessed the killing and mistreatment of Russian prisoners taken to Ukraine to fight for the group.  Andrei Medvedev made an unverified claim that in the four months he was with Wagner, he saw two people who didn't want to fight being shot.  About 80% of Wagner's personnel in Ukraine have been drawn from prisons, according to the US National Security Council. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64492938
Russian army officer admits: 'Our troops tortured Ukrainians',"Allegations of brutal interrogations, where Ukrainian men were shot and threatened with rape, have been made by a former Russian military officer.  Konstantin Yefremov, the most senior officer to speak openly, told the BBC in an exclusive interview Russia now sees him as a traitor and defector. At one site in southern Ukraine, he said ""the interrogations, the torture, continued for about a week"".  ""Every day, at night, sometimes twice a day."" Mr Yefremov tried to resign from the army numerous times - but he ended up being dismissed for refusing to return to Ukraine. He has now fled Russia. Using photographs and military documents supplied by Mr Yefremov, the BBC has verified he was in Ukraine early in the war - in the Zaporizhzhia region, including the city of Melitopol. This article contains graphic descriptions of torture. Konstantin Yefremov's face flickers into view on my computer screen and we start to talk. He is a man with a story to tell. Until recently he was a Russian army officer.  Deployed to Ukraine last year, the former senior lieutenant has agreed to tell me about the crimes he says he witnessed there - including torture and mistreatment of Ukrainian prisoners. He will talk about his comrades looting occupied areas of Ukraine, and describe brutal interrogation sessions, led by a Russian colonel, in which men were shot and threatened with rape. On 10 February 2022, Mr Yefremov says he arrived in Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia nine years ago. He was the head of a de-mining unit of the 42nd Motorised Rifle Division - and was usually based in Chechnya, in Russia's North Caucasus. He and his men were sent to take part in ""military exercises"", he says.  ""At the time no-one believed there would be war. Everyone thought this was only a drill. I'm sure even senior officers didn't know."" Mr Yefremov recalls seeing Russian troops taping identification marks on their uniforms and painting the letter ""Z"" on military equipment and vehicles. Within days, ""Z"" had become the symbol of what the Kremlin was calling its ""special military operation"".  Mr Yefremov claims he wanted nothing to do with it.    ""I decided to quit. I went to my commander and explained my position. He took me to a senior officer who called me a traitor and a coward. ""I left my gun, got in a taxi and drove off. I wanted to return to my base in Chechnya and resign officially. Then my comrades telephoned me with a warning.  ""A colonel had promised to put me in prison for up to 10 years for desertion and he'd alerted the police."" Mr Yefremov says he called a military lawyer, who advised him to turn around.  ""I realise now I should have ignored that and driven on,"" he says. ""But I was afraid of being put in jail.""  He went back to join his men. Mr Yefremov insists he is ""anti-war"". He assures me he did not participate in Russia's annexation of Crimea, or fight in eastern Ukraine when war first erupted in the Donbas nine years ago.  In 2014, Russia was not only accused of orchestrating a separatist uprising there, but of sending in its own troops. Konstantin also tells me he has not taken part in Russia's military operation in Syria.  ""For the last three years I had been involved in mine clearance in Chechnya, a place that had experienced two wars. I think the work I've done there has benefited people."" Mr Yefremov was placed in temporary charge of a rifle platoon. On 27 February, three days after the Russian invasion, he says he and his men were ordered to move north from occupied Crimea. They headed for the city of Melitopol. The next 10 days were spent at an airfield which had already been captured by Russian troops. He describes the looting he witnessed. ""Soldiers and officers grabbed everything they could. They climbed all over the planes and went through all the buildings. One soldier took away a lawnmower. He said proudly, 'I'll take this home and cut the grass next to our barracks.'  ""Buckets, axes, bicycles, they bunged it all in their trucks. So much stuff they had to squat down to fit in the vehicles."" Mr Yefremov has sent us photographs he says he took at Melitopol air base. They show transport planes and a building on fire.  They are among a number of pictures and documents he has shared - and which we have verified - to confirm Mr Yefremov's identity, rank and his movements in Ukraine in the spring of 2022.  Online mapping tools confirmed the images of Melitopol air base. For a month and a half, he and eight soldiers under his command guarded a Russian artillery unit there. ""The whole time we slept outside,"" he recalls. ""We were so hungry we started hunting for rabbits and pheasants. One time we came across a mansion. There was a Russian fighter inside. 'We're with the 100th Brigade and we live here now,' the soldier said.  ""There was so much food. The fridges were packed. There was enough food to survive a nuclear war. But the soldiers living there were catching the Japanese carp in the pond outside and eating them."" Konstantin Yefremov's group moved to guard what he describes as a ""logistics headquarters"" in April - in the town of Bilmak, to the north-east of Melitopol. There, he says he witnessed interrogations and mistreatment of Ukrainian prisoners. He recalls a day when three prisoners were brought in. ""One of them admitted to being a sniper. On hearing this, the Russian colonel lost his mind. He hit him, he pulled the Ukrainian's trousers down and asked if he was married.  ""'Yes,' the prisoner replied. 'Then someone bring me a mop,' said the colonel. 'We'll turn you into a girl and send your wife the video.'"" Another time, says Mr Yefremov, the colonel asked the prisoner to name all the Ukrainian nationalists in his unit. ""The Ukrainian didn't understand the question. He replied that the soldiers were naval infantry of the Ukrainian armed forces. For that answer they knocked out some of his teeth."" The Kremlin wants Russians to believe that, in Ukraine, Russia is fighting fascists, neo-Nazis and ultra-nationalists. This false narrative serves to dehumanise Ukrainians in the eyes of the Russian public and the military. Mr Yefremov says the Ukrainian prisoner had a blindfold on.  ""The colonel put a pistol to the prisoner's forehead and said 'I'm going to count to three and then shoot you in the head.'  ""He counted and then fired just to the side of his head, on both sides. The colonel started shouting at him. I said: 'Comrade colonel! He can't hear you, you've deafened him!'"" Mr Yefremov describes how the colonel gave orders that the Ukrainians shouldn't be given normal food - only water and crackers. But he says: ""We tried to give them hot tea and cigarettes.""  So that the prisoners didn't sleep on bare ground, Mr Yefremov also recalls how his men tossed them hay - ""at night, so that no-one saw us"".  During another interrogation, Mr Yefremov says the colonel shot a prisoner in the arm - and in the right leg under the knee, which hit the bone. Konstantin says his men bandaged the prisoner up and went to the Russian commanders - ""not to the Colonel, he was crazy"" - and said the prisoner needed to go to hospital, otherwise he would die from blood loss. ""We dressed him up in a Russian uniform and took him to hospital. We told him: 'Don't say you're a Ukrainian prisoner of war, because either the doctors will refuse to treat you, or the injured Russian soldiers will hear and shoot you and we won't be able to stop them."" The UN's Human Rights Office has been documenting cases of mistreatment of prisoners in the war in Ukraine. It has interviewed more than 400 POWs - both Ukrainians and Russians.  ""Unfortunately, we've found there is torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war happening on both sides,"" says Matilda Bogner, head of the UN's Ukraine-based monitoring team.  ""If we compare the violations, the torture or ill-treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war tends to happen at almost every stage of confinement. And, for the most part, the conditions of internment are worse in many areas of Russia or occupied Ukraine."" The worst forms of torture or ill treatment for Ukrainian prisoners of war usually occur during interrogation, says Ms Bogner. They can be subjected to electrocution and a whole range of torture methods - she says - including hanging people up and beating them.  ""When they arrive at places of internment there are often so-called welcoming beatings. They also often face inadequate food and water,"" she adds. Russian prisoners of war, too, have reported beatings and suffering electrocution. ""Any form of torture or ill treatment is prohibited under international law,"" says Ms Bogner. ""It is unacceptable for either side to do this."" The BBC was unable to independently confirm Konstantin Yefremov's specific allegations of torture, but they are consistent with other claims of abuse of Ukrainian prisoners. Russia's Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr Yefremov would eventually return to his de-mining unit, but not for long. ""Seven of us had taken the decision [to leave the army],"" he tells me. At the end of May, back in Chechnya, he wrote his letter of resignation. Some senior officers were not happy.  ""They started threatening me. Officers who hadn't spent a day in Ukraine were telling me that I was a coward and a traitor. They wouldn't allow me to resign. I was dismissed."" Mr Yefremov shows us letters from the military. In the first document, he is accused of ""shirking his duties"" and disregarding an order to return to Ukraine. It is described as ""a serious breach of discipline"". The second letter refers to Mr Yefremov's ""early dismissal from military service… for breaking his contract"". ""After 10 years of service I was denounced as a traitor, a defector, just because I didn't want to kill people,"" he says. ""But I was glad that I was now a free person, that I wouldn't have to kill or be killed.""  Mr Yefremov was out of the army. But not out of danger of being sent back to the war. In September 2022, President Putin declared what he called ""partial mobilisation"". Hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens would be drafted into the military and sent to Ukraine. Mr Yefremov says he knew - because he had already served with the military in Ukraine - he would not be left alone. He came up with an escape plan. ""In the house where I was living I made a hatch in the attic ceiling… in case police and enlistment officers broke in to deliver call-up papers.  ""Enlistment officers were driving to my house and waiting for me in their cars. So, I rented a flat and hid there.  ""I hid from the neighbours, too, because I'd heard of cases when neighbours told police about young men who'd been drafted and were hiding. I found this situation humiliating and unacceptable.""   Mr Yefremov contacted Russian human rights group Gulagu.net, which helped him leave Russia.   What does Mr Yefremov think about those Russians - and there are many - who express support for Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine? ""I don't know what's going on in their heads,"" he says. ""How could they allow themselves to be fooled? When they go to market, they know they could be short-changed. They don't trust their wives, their husbands.  ""But the man who has been deceiving them for 20 years, he only has to give the word and these people are ready to go and kill and die. I can't understand it."" As we end our chat, Mr Yefremov says sorry to the people of Ukraine. ""I apologise to the entire Ukrainian nation for coming to their home as an uninvited guest with a weapon in my hands. ""Thank God I didn't hurt anyone. I didn't kill anyone. Thank God I wasn't killed.  ""I don't even have the moral right to ask for forgiveness from the Ukrainians. I can't forgive myself, so I can't expect them to forgive me.""

"Petr Pavel: Ukraine deserves to join Nato, says new Czech leader","Czech President-elect Petr Pavel has told the BBC that Ukraine should be allowed to join Nato ""as soon as the war is over"".  Mr Pavel, a retired Nato general, said Ukraine would be ""morally and practically ready"" to join the Western alliance once the conflict had ended.  In his first broadcast interview with the international media since his election, Gen Pavel gave a robust defence of Western military support to Kyiv, saying there should be ""almost no limits"" to what countries should send.   Speaking from the renaissance Hrzansky Palace, a few hundred metres from Prague Castle, he said for him sending Western fighter planes such as F-16s was ""not taboo"", but he was unsure they could be delivered in a timeframe that could prove useful to Kyiv.  US President Joe Biden has ruled out sending F-16s this week, although France's Emmanuel Macron has said nothing is excluded. ""I am proud of my country being one of the first to provide Ukraine with significant military help,"" he told the BBC.   The Czech Republic was the first Western country to send tanks and infantry fighting vehicles - Soviet-designed T72s and BMP1s - to Kyiv, part of a series of deliveries of heavy weapons that reportedly began as early as March 2022.  Almost a year on, after much agonising and soul-searching, countries including the UK, the United States and Germany have begun answering Kyiv's repeated calls to send modern, Western-made tanks such as Leopard 2s, Challenger 2s and M1 Abrams.   ""Probably very few people could imagine that Western countries would be willing to provide Ukraine with modern main battle tanks or long-range artillery or anti-aircraft systems,"" he went on.  Now, he said, it was reality.   ""But at the same time we see it's still not enough"" to counter Russia's significant resources of men and materiel, he added.  He acknowledged Kyiv's disappointment at the speed of deliveries, especially Western tanks, which were explicitly designed to punch holes - literally and figuratively - through Soviet armoured formations.  Ukraine has asked for 300 such tanks and says the West has so far promised to send at least 120. But Gen Pavel said he hoped that would speed up - especially if Russia launches its anticipated spring offensive.   The president-elect brushed aside the view - long held in some European capitals, especially Berlin - that such deliveries could be seen as ""escalation"".  Russia has warned that increased supplies of Western weapons will lead to Nato countries increasingly becoming directly involved in the conflict. ""We have no alternative,"" he said. ""If we leave Ukraine without assistance, they would most probably lose this war. And if they lose - we all lose.""  President-elect Pavel also said that he and other European leaders had a duty to explain to their sceptical - and in many cases frightened populations - of the sense in helping Ukraine.  ""Our cities are not being destroyed by Russian artillery and missiles. But our future could be destroyed if we don't support Ukraine to a successful end to this conflict.""  And he also dismissed claims - among them from the man who stood against him this weekend, former Prime Minister Andrej Babis - that he was closing the door to diplomacy.  ""Once there is even the slightest chance of peace talks, let's support it. But there are no signs of it from the Russian side,"" said Mr Pavel, who was often portrayed as a warmonger during the campaign.  ""What needs to be said is this: the end of war is entirely in Russian hands. It would take only one decision from President Putin to withdraw his forces from Ukraine and the war is over.""  And once it was over, he told the BBC, he could see a clear place for Ukraine in Nato.  ""The Ukrainian military will be probably the most experienced military in Europe. Ukraine deserves to be part of a community of democratic countries.""     Including Nato? I asked.  ""I believe they really deserve it.""  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64455121
"Ukraine war: Russian threat growing, front line troops fear","Ukrainian troops on the front lines in the Donbas have told the BBC that Russian forces are ""learning every day and changing their strategy"" as they continue to gain ground around the heavily contested town of Bakhmut. But the soldiers also insisted that morale remains high, despite growing exhaustion after almost a year of war. The two Ukrainian soldiers swept into the room, still visibly flushed with adrenalin, having just driven straight from the furiously active front lines along the rolling, snow-covered hills further south. Peering over a giant map at their brigade's temporary headquarters, they jabbed at the spots where Russian forces were inching forwards towards a key road. ""They were about 400 metres [437 yards] from us, across the field just here. We're holding on, but it's getting harder,"" said Sgt Denys Kalchuk from the all-volunteer Dnipro-1 Battalion, going on to describe how Russian infantry, fighter jets and artillery units appeared to be operating with growing co-ordination and effectiveness around Bakhmut.  ""The planes are the worst. You can't hear them until it's too late. It's the same with the tanks. Artillery is easier - at least you might have a second or two [to dive for cover] after you hear them coming,"" said Sgt Kalchuk. Assessing the overall state of the conflict across the Donbas is extremely difficult. Access is challenging and dangerous, and dozens of different Ukrainian battalions and brigades are working on separate tasks, amid some secrecy, spread out along hundreds of miles of often fast-changing front lines.  But after several weeks travelling across the region, and more than a dozen on-the-record interviews and frank off-the-record discussions with a broad range of Ukrainian soldiers, I have seen various themes emerging. For weeks, Russia's notorious mercenary group Wagner has led much of the fighting around Bakhmut, sustaining catastrophic numbers of casualties by launching near-suicidal mass infantry attacks on smaller towns like Soledar. But in recent days, according to some Ukrainian soldiers, Russia's regular army has resumed a more prominent role, with noticeable effect. ""It is very hard for us now. We understand that Russia is learning every day and changing their strategy. And I think we need to learn faster,"" said Dmytro Podvorchanskyi, who heads a reconnaissance unit in Dnipro-1.  He and others spoke of the way well-equipped regular Russian forces were now hiding and dispersing their ammunition stores far better and targeting Ukrainian logistics routes more effectively. As a result, they are continuing to gain ground around Bakhmut and threatening another potentially significant town, Vuhledar, further south. But there is no indication, as yet, that Russian forces are poised to make a strategically significant breakthrough. One senior commander said Western supplies had now brought a balance to what had been a deeply uneven artillery war, and that Western tanks could soon tip the overall balance in Ukraine's favour.  While it is no surprise that many Ukrainian troops are suffering from exhaustion after months of conflict, morale, in general, appears to be holding. ""There have been cases of [Ukrainian] units who don't seem willing to fight, and disagreements [over tactics],"" one Ukrainian soldier acknowledged, speaking off the record.  Others talked about the trauma of seeing their friends die, of units that had sustained overwhelming numbers of casualties and of the psychological impact of fighting amidst the corpses of so many uncollected Russian soldiers. One soldier, citing fears of a new Russian mobilisation and the huge size of the enemy's population, spoke of his fear that ""Russia will grind us down"". But most troops we met waved away such doubts, blaming them on exhaustion and - in general - praising their commanders for giving them time to rest. One increasingly common excuse offered for Ukraine's struggles around Bakhmut is the theory that relatively weak and inexperienced units are now being left to hold the line here, while the army's strongest forces are being moved elsewhere ahead of a widely anticipated Ukrainian counterattack, or counterattacks. The location of any such potential offensives remains the subject of much speculation among Ukrainian troops. Some anticipate a push further north, into Luhansk province, while others wonder about an attack south towards Melitopol, in order to isolate and threaten Russian forces in and around the Crimean peninsula.  One experienced officer said he believed Russia was looking to straighten its frontline, take a few more chunks of the Donbas, and then declare ""mission accomplished"" and push for peace negotiations. He said he was sure Ukraine would never agree to that but warned that the military would need Western fighter jets to break through all of Russia's new defences, particularly in the south of the country.

Ukraine war: Western allies send Kyiv mixed messages on war planes,"US President Joe Biden has ruled out providing F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, despite renewed calls from top Kyiv officials for urgent air support.  Asked on Monday if the US would be sending the planes, Mr Biden said ""no"". The UK also said it was ""not practical"" for it to send its aircraft to Ukraine. France's Emmanuel Macron said ""by definition, nothing is excluded"" ahead of meeting a Ukrainian minister. Ukraine says advanced jets will help protect its skies from Russian attacks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the country's top military officials say there should be no taboos on such military aid - but the US and its partners fear this would lead to further escalation with a nuclear-armed Russia.  On Tuesday, Ukraine's Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat was quoted by the Ukrainska Pravda news website as saying that Kyiv needed up to 200 multi-role fighter jets - such as F-16s - to defend its skies.  He said that Russia currently outnumbered Ukraine by five to six times in terms of the number of war planes. The US-made F-16s would be a significant upgrade on the Soviet-era fighting jets - mostly MiGs - Ukraine is currently using, which were made before the country declared independence from the USSR in 1991. However, Mr Biden has repeatedly rebuffed Ukraine's pleas for the jets, instead focussing on providing military support in other areas. Other Western allies have been been less definitive though. On Monday, President Macron did not rule out sending its war planes to Ukraine - but he stressed that it must neither further inflame the situation nor limit France's ability to defend itself.  Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov is now in Paris, where he is expected to discuss the issue with Mr Macron and French military officials later on Tuesday. Poland - another key ally of Ukraine - has also not ruled out sending F-16s to Kyiv. However, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said any such move would only be possible ""in complete co-ordination"" with other Nato members. The US announced last week it would supply Kyiv with 31 Abrams tanks, reversing its earlier stance on the issue. The UK and Germany also pledged similar support. Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Andriy Melnyk welcomed that announcement but asked allies for the creation of a ""fighter jet coalition"" that would also provide Ukraine with Eurofighters, Tornados, French Rafales and Swedish Gripen jets. On Tuesday, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman said he was not aware of any formal request from Ukraine for aircraft, adding that ""the UK's Typhoon and F-35 jets are extremely sophisticated and take months to learn how to fly"".  ""Given that we believe it is not practical to send those jets to Ukraine."" However, the spokesperson said Mr Sunak ""has had intensive discussions with military advisers"" and ""the conclusion is that given Russia's advantage in numbers a sustained war of attrition would not benefit Ukraine"". Germany has also said it will not send fighter jets to Ukraine.  The F-16 Fighting Falcon is widely considered one of the world's most reliable fighter jets and is used by other countries, such as Belgium and Pakistan.  It can be armed with precision-guided missiles and bombs and is able to fly at 1,500 mph (2,400 km/h), according to the US Air Force.  The F-16's targeting capabilities would allow Ukraine to attack Russian forces in all weather conditions and at night with greater accuracy. Moscow has repeatedly accused Nato of being an aggressor by proxy, warning that further escalation could trigger a nuclear war.

Russian tanker Greenpeace protest case will not be appealed,"The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it would not appeal a verdict from a district judge who acquitted 10 Greenpeace activists in the case of a Russian tanker being unable to dock. Protesters occupied a jetty at the Navigator Terminals in Grays, Essex, on the night of 15 May. District judge Christopher Williams found them not guilty of aggravated trespass after a two-day trial. A CPS spokesman said: ""We respect the decision of the court.""  It is understood prosecutors gave a potential appeal careful consideration. Chelmsford Magistrates' Court heard in November a group attached themselves to the jetty at the Navigator Terminal and displayed banners reading ""oil fuels war"". The Andromeda tanker, carrying an estimated 33,000 tonnes of Russian diesel, was turned around in the early hours of 16 May. Russia invaded Ukraine nearly three months' earlier. Prosecutor Monali Raleraskar argued the case did not ""require an analysis of what's morally right"". Mr Williams, however, said it was ""more than likely the Russian war could be described as terrorism"". Greenpeace's head of climate, Mel Evans, said the CPS's latest decision was ""the last seal on the vindication of our activists' actions"". ""Ministers should have acted far more quickly and comprehensively to cut off the flow of fossil fuel cash powering the Kremlin's death machine,"" said Ms Evans.

Poland boosts defence spending over war in Ukraine,"Poland has announced a sharp increase in defence spending, saying the change is needed because of the Ukraine war.  It is the latest European country to say it is increasing military spending as a result of the conflict. Poland has a military budget of just less than 2.5% of its GDP, but the prime minister says he wants to increase the figure to 4% this year.  Last week, Mateusz Morawiecki urged Germany to allow his country to export Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine. ""The war in Ukraine makes us arm ourselves even faster. That is why this year we will make an unprecedented effort: 4% of GDP for the Polish army,"" Mr Morawiecki said. Raising defence spending to 4% ""might mean that this will be the highest percentage... among all Nato countries,"" he added. Poland, which borders the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, has previously said it was buying 116 Abrams tanks from the US with the first deliveries to start this spring. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led many Western countries to review their military spending - and in many cases, increase it significantly. Members of the Nato Western military alliance have agreed to spend at least 2% of GDP, a measure of a country's economic output, on defence from 2024. The figure of 2% has been a long-standing target for the alliance. Recently, France outlined plans for a major boost to its armed forces in part due to the war in Ukraine, saying the next seven-year budget would increase to €413bn (£360bn) from 2024-30, up from €295bn. Sweden and Finland have announced steep increases in their military budgets as part of their bid to join Nato.  Days after the invasion in February 2022, Germany pledged an extra €100bn of the budget to the armed forces.  And in June, the UK promised under former prime minister Boris Johnson to increase spending to 2.5% of GDP. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64457401
Ukraine: Boris Johnson says Putin threatened him with missile strike,"Boris Johnson has said Vladimir Putin threatened him with a missile strike in an ""extraordinary"" phone call in the run-up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  The then-prime minister said Mr Putin told him it ""would only take a minute"". Mr Johnson said the comment was made after he warned the war would be an ""utter catastrophe"". The claim is made in a BBC documentary on Mr Putin's interactions with world leaders over the years. The Kremlin spokesman said it was a ""lie"".  Mr Johnson warned Mr Putin that invading Ukraine would lead to Western sanctions and more Nato troops on Russia's borders.  He also tried to deter Russian military action by telling Mr Putin that Ukraine would not join Nato ""for the foreseeable future"".  But Mr Johnson said: ""He threatened me at one point, and he said, 'Boris, I don't want to hurt you but, with a missile, it would only take a minute' or something like that. Jolly.  ""But I think from the very relaxed tone that he was taking, the sort of air of detachment that he seemed to have, he was just playing along with my attempts to get him to negotiate."" President Putin had been ""very familiar"" during the ""most extraordinary call"", Mr Johnson said.   No reference to the exchange appeared in accounts released to the media of the call by Downing Street. But with all officially arranged phone calls, there are always detailed minutes taken by a Number 10 official and retained for the archive.  Putin vs the West From the 2014 seizure of Crimea to the invasion of Ukraine, this is the inside story of a decade of clashes - as told by the Western leaders who traded blows with Putin's Russia. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) It is impossible to know if Mr Putin's threat was genuine.   However, given previous Russian attacks on the UK - most recently in Salisbury in 2018 - any threat from the Russian leader, however lightly delivered, is probably one Mr Johnson would have had no choice but to take seriously.  In his response, Mr Putin's spokesman said the former prime minister's claim was ""either a deliberate falsehood, in which case you need to ask Mr Johnson why he lied, or it was not a deliberate lie. That is, he didn't understand what President Putin was saying to him"". ""There were no threats to use missiles,"" Dmitry Peskov told the BBC.  The Kremlin leader, he said, had simply pointed out that ""if Ukraine joined Nato the potential deployment of Nato or US missiles near Russia's border would mean that any missile could reach Moscow within minutes"". Since the invasion, President Putin has warned countries that may try to interfere, that Russia's response would be immediate - even hinting at the use of nuclear weapons. Nine days after Mr Johnson's conversation with President Putin, on 11 February, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace flew to Moscow to meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu. The BBC documentary Putin Vs the West reveals Mr Wallace left with assurances that Russia would not invade Ukraine, but he said both sides knew it was a lie.  He described it as a ""demonstration of bullying or strength, which is: I'm going to lie to you, you know I'm lying and I know you know I'm lying and I'm still going to lie to you. ""I think it was about saying 'I'm powerful',"" Mr Wallace said.  He said the ""fairly chilling, but direct lie"" had confirmed his belief that Russia would invade.  As he left the meeting, he said Gen Valery Gerasimov - Russia's chief of general staff - told him ""never again will we be humiliated"". Another significant encounter in the months leading up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine was with CIA director William Burns, who landed in Moscow on 2 November 2021. Mr Burns had been circling the Russian capital for hours, as heavy fog prevented his landing, but when he finally arrived at the Kremlin he discovered Mr Putin was not there. Instead, he was sheltering in the southern Russian city of Sochi amid a spike in Covid infections. The pair spoke over the phone. The CIA director said he was direct in laying out the message President Biden had sent him to deliver: the US knew what Mr Putin was up to and he would pay a heavy price if he launched such an invasion. He said the Russian president did not deny planning was underway and listed grievances about Ukraine and the West. ""I was troubled before I arrived in Moscow. And I was even more troubled after I left,"" Mr Burns added. Less than a fortnight after the UK defence secretary left Moscow, as tanks rolled over the border on 24 February, Mr Johnson received a phone call in the middle of the night from President Zelensky. ""Zelensky's very, very calm,"" Mr Johnson recalled. ""But, he tells me, you know, they're attacking everywhere."" Mr Johnson says he offered to help move the president to safety.  ""He doesn't take me up on that offer. He heroically stayed where he was."" Putin Vs the West will be broadcast on Monday 30 January on BBC Two at 21:00, and will be available on the iPlayer in the UK. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64397745
Ukraine war: Funeral held for battleground body collector,"Against a backdrop of muffled booms from the frontlines to the south and east, people sank to their knees and threw roses in front of the van as it inched past them.  Then, as the back door opened and a wooden coffin was pulled out, the sobbing began. ""My son! Why?"" cried Ludmilla Sosnenko, clutching her daughter for comfort. There have been many untimely, unexpected funerals in this northern Donbas town in recent months, but this one, unusually, was not for a soldier or a regular civilian.  Denys Sosnenko - a 21-year-old former Ukrainian national kickboxing champion - volunteered last year to work as a body collector for a charitable organisation known as Black Tulip, who scour the frontlines for the abandoned corpses of soldiers, both Ukrainian and Russian. ""Denys - there are many angels on your shoulders today - the angels of those you brought back home,"" said Alexey Yukov, the local head of Black Tulip, addressing the crowd. ""Because of your work so many soldiers, who died in places no one would ever have looked, have been reunited with their families."" Sosnenko died last week when the van he was driving - a van very much like the one that carried his body into the town square - hit an anti-tank mine close to the frontlines.  ""He always said 'this is my mission - I have to do this'. It was dangerous work, but he would reassure us, saying 'don't worry, we are protecting the souls of the dead,'"" his mother Ludmilla said. ""He was always cheerful and had big plans for life after the war."" Last year, the BBC filmed Sosnenko and his team at work more than once.  He spoke of the horrors of the job, picking bodies up, piece by piece, and of the constant dangers - not just from the war raging around them, but from boobytraps often hidden beneath corpses, allegedly by retreating Russian troops. The team often use drones and other equipment to search for explosive devices. But Sosnenko and his colleagues also talked passionately about the importance of their work.  Many of the bodies they've collected over the past 11 months have been those of Russian soldiers which have then been exchanged, across the frontlines, for the bodies of missing Ukrainian servicemen. ""We feel a sense of grace in doing this, in bringing people home to their families,"" Artur Semeyko - who worked alongside Sosnenko - said, recalling the peace they had brought to people who had previously been unable to arrange a proper funeral for their missing relatives. Speaking after Sosnenko's funeral, in a snow-bound cemetery on the edge of Slovyansk, Mr Semeyko insisted that nothing had changed. ""We are glad we were able to bury him with honour,"" said Mr Semeyko. ""He accomplished so much in such a short life, but now we must continue our work to bring more people home."" ""We will return to work as soon as possible,"" agreed Mr Yukov.  ""We will go back, even if it costs us our lives,"" he added. ""We realise that we don't have time to mourn, because the war goes on and so many lads are dying. They too, must be brought home."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64446436

"Ukraine war: Russian athletes cannot be allowed at Olympics, Zelensky says","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says that allowing Russia to compete at the 2024 Olympics in Paris would amount to showing that ""terror is somehow acceptable"". He said he had raised the issue with French President Emmanuel Macron. Moscow must not be allowed to use the Olympics for propaganda, he added. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said Russian and Belarusian athletes could compete as neutrals at the Olympics. But Ukraine has threatened to boycott Paris 2024 if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete. Attempts by the IOC ""to bring Russian athletes back into the Olympic Games are attempts to tell the whole world that terror is somehow acceptable"", Mr Zelensky said in his nightly video address. Russia must not be allowed to use the Games ""or any other sport event as propaganda for its aggression or its state chauvinism"", he added. The IOC said this week that Russian and Belarusian athletes could compete as ""neutral athletes"", stating that ""no athlete should be prevented from competing just because of their passport"". But Mr Zelensky says there can be no neutrality in sport while his country's athletes are dying on the battlefield. He also drew comparison with the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin when the Nazis were in power. ""There was a major Olympic mistake,"" he said. ""The Olympic movement and terrorist states definitely should not cross paths."" The UK government has also condemned the plan to allow athletes to compete neutrally as a ""world away from the reality of war"". Mr Zelensky's comments came as Russian forces continued to bombard the Ukrainian region of Kherson into the night, after a day of attacks which left at least three people dead.   Six others were wounded, two of them when a hospital was hit, local officials say.  The Kherson regional administration said the region was shelled almost 40 times on Saturday and was pounded continually on Sunday.  Kherson was the only regional capital to have fallen to Russian forces since the February 2022 invasion, but they were forced into a humiliating retreat in November.  President Zelensky said Russia had also stepped up its attacks in the eastern Donetsk region. He said his forces needed new weapons to confront a ""very tough"" situation of constant attacks. ""Russia wants the war to drag on and exhaust our forces. So we have to make time our weapon. We have to speed up events, speed up supplies and open up new weapons options for Ukraine,"" he said.

German chancellor says he won't send fighter jets to Ukraine,"The German chancellor has ruled out sending fighter jets to Ukraine, just days after committing to supplying tanks. In an interview with a German newspaper, Olaf Scholz warned against a bidding war for weapons.  But Ukraine has asked allied nations to create a ""fighter jet coalition"" to bolster their capabilities.  The US said it would discuss the idea of supplying jets ""very carefully"" with Kyiv on Thursday.  In an interview with Tagesspiegel, Mr Scholz said his focus was on the delivery of German-made Leopard 2 tanks. ""The fact we've only just made a decision [on sending tanks] and the next debate is firing up in Germany, that just seems frivolous"", he said.  On Wednesday Germany committed to supplying 14 of its Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, after weeks of pressure from allies. Following Germany's commitment to send the tanks, the US said it would provide Ukraine with its M1 Abrams tanks.  Ukraine's deputy foreign minister, Andrii Melnyk, has called for the creation of a ""fighter jet coalition"" that would provide Ukraine with US F-16s and F-35s, Eurofighters, Tornados, French Rafales and Swedish Gripen jets. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak told Ukraine's Freedom Television Network they also needed missiles ""to drastically reduce the Russian army's key weapon"". And Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky echoed that in a daily video address where he said the country needed the US-made ATACMS missile, which has a range of 185 miles (297km).  He said the missiles would help Ukraine anticipate Russian attacks on urban areas and civilians.  Washington has so far refused to provide that weapon.  In the Tagesspiegel interview, Mr Scholz reiterated that Nato was not at war with Russia, ""we will not allow such an escalation,"" he said.  He confirmed that he speaks regularly to Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, with the most recent call between the two in December 2022.  ""We need to talk to each other,"" he said, but added that he was always clear that Russia's invasion of Ukraine was absolutely unacceptable and only the withdrawal of its troops would resolve the situation.

"How tanks from Germany, US and UK could change the Ukraine war","Is this the week when the war dramatically turned in Ukraine's favour? It was certainly a decisive moment, with a coalition of Western nations confirming they were finally willing to supply modern-made main battle tanks.  Germany said it would send Leopard 2 tanks and the US said it would send M1 Abrams tanks. Both the UK and Poland have already made concrete pledges, and other nations are expected to follow. Some commentators have described the move as a potential ""gamechanger"".  But is it really enough to win the war?  Ben Barry, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (ISS), tells the BBC that Western tanks will make a difference. But the former British Army Brigadier also warns that the pledges made so far are unlikely to prove decisive.  In modern warfare, tanks have been a key element for offensive operations - to punch through enemy lines and retake territory.  Used effectively, they provide mobile firepower, protection, shock and surprise. Concentrated in numbers, they can dislocate an enemy's defences. But they also need the support of artillery to first weaken those defences and then the support of infantry to hold retaken ground. History shows tanks alone don't win battles. The British first used hundreds of tanks at the battle of Cambrai in November 1917 - to end the deadlock of static trench warfare. Initially they made significant advances, but many tanks soon broke down and a German counter offensive turned British gains into losses. Tanks can also be used in defence. In 1940 they were used by the retreating British and French armies at Arras to stall the Nazi invasion, allowing the subsequent evacuation of British troops from Dunkirk.  But Ukraine has made clear that it wants weapons not just to stall any potential Russian spring offensive, but to retake its own territory - to go on the attack. It would make little sense for Ukraine to disperse its additional tanks across a frontline of more than 1,000km (621 miles). To break through Russian defences, Ukraine will need to concentrate its forces - possibly over an area of between five and 20km (between three and 12 miles).  Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former colonel in the British Army's Royal Tank Regiment, says numbers do matter for a breakthrough. An armoured brigade for a significant offensive operation would normally include at least 70 tanks. So more than 100 Western battle tanks could make a big difference, he says. If Ukraine had more it could try to conduct simultaneous offensive operations in different places, as it did last year in the north and the south.  Then there's the additional support required for what the military call ""combined arms manoeuvre"".  The UK is not just sending Ukraine 14 Challenger tanks, but also 30 artillery self-propelled guns and armoured vehicles to carry and protect troops.  That new package of military support also includes mine breaching and bridge-laying vehicles. In other words, the essential elements needed for any offensive operation. The US is also providing Ukraine with more than 100 Bradley and Stryker armoured vehicles, and Germany 40 of its Marder infantry fighting vehicle - as well as tanks. Tanks are the tip of the spear, designed to move quickly over open ground. The Challenger 2, Leopard 2 and M1 Abrams are faster than most Russian-made tanks with speeds of more than 25mph (40km per hour) on rough terrain.  To take ground quickly, with any element of surprise, they would likely avoid urban areas where they would be more vulnerable to attack. Russia showed early on in this war, in its failed attempt to surround Kyiv, that a long column of armour on a road is an easy target.  Mr Barry, of ISS, says any spearhead attack would look for an enemy's weak points. But he also warns that Russia has spent the last few months reinforcing defensive positions with trenches and tank traps.  Western tanks are also about 20 tonnes heavier than their Russian counterparts. The additional armour gives better protection but it also means the tanks may be too heavy to cross some makeshift bridges. Russia and Ukraine have both blown bridges to slow down advances. Mr de Bretton Gordon, who commanded a squadron of British Challenger tanks, says one of the big advantages of Western-made tanks is their ability to fight at night. Night sights and thermal imaging camera are standard. Only Russia's more advanced tanks - like the T-90 - are fitted to fight at night. Attacks under the cover of darkness also add to the element of shock and surprise. The greatest challenge for Ukraine will be logistics - maintaining the flow of fuel, ammunition and spare parts. Ukraine is not just having to maintain its old Soviet-era arsenal, it is also having to worry about an increasingly complex inventory of Western supplied weapons.  Britain's Challenger 2 tanks, for instance, do not use the same Nato standard ammunition as the Leopard and Abrams. The Challenger 2 is no longer in production and even the British Army has had to cannibalise some spare parts from its existing fleet.  Mr Barry says Ukrainian engineers may be familiar with repairing diesel engines - like those in the Leopard and Challenger. But he says the US-made Abrams runs on a more complicated gas turbine engine. It also consumes about twice the amount of fuel as a German-made Leopard.  If Western pledges are firmed, Ukraine's armed forces could be boosted by more than 100 tanks. That would still fall well short of what Ukraine's overall military commander asked for.  Last October, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi said Ukraine needed an additional 300 tanks, 700 infantry fighting vehicles and 500 howitzers for his planned offensive this year. It might end up with just half of that.  The training required on the weapons will take time too - weeks if not months. And it's still not clear when all this equipment will arrive.  The US has indicated that its 31 M1 Abrams tanks might not be ready for months. Ukraine is also waiting for the West to respond to its repeated request for modern warplanes. An army attacking on the ground will need protection from the air.  Western officials had hoped that Ukraine may be able to mount an offensive as soon as this spring. They believe there is now a window of opportunity while Russia struggles to recruit and rebuild its battered forces, and to replenish its dwindling supplies of ammunition.  Ukraine has managed to prove the doubters wrong in the past - but it will still need more Western support if it is to achieve its goal of expelling Russian forces.

Ukraine war: Auschwitz anniversary marked without Russia,"For the first time a Russian delegation was not invited to a ceremony marking the liberation of the former Auschwitz-Birkenau Nazi death camp in modern-day Poland.  Russia is usually represented at the event, as the camp in occupied Poland was liberated by the Soviet Army. But this year, following Moscow's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum declined to invite Russian officials and its director likened the Ukraine war to the horrors of the Holocaust. In response, Russia accused the museum of attempting to ""rewrite history"".  At the event on Friday, museum director Piotr Cywinski said Auschwitz was created by Nazi ""megalomania"" and a ""similar sick megalomania"" and ""similar lust for power"" had driven Russia's destruction of Mariupol and Donetsk.  Speaking to an audience including camp survivors, he warned that ""once again, innocent people are being killed en masse in Europe"". ""Russia, unable to conquer Ukraine, has decided to destroy it. We see it every day, even as we stand here. And so it is difficult to stand here today."" Reacting to the decision, Russia said Soviet soldiers who freed Auschwitz would not be forgotten.  ""No matter how our European 'non-partners' contrived in their attempts to rewrite history in a new way, the memory of the Soviet heroes-liberators and horrors of Nazism cannot be erased,"" Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote in a pointed social media post. Auschwitz survivors also expressed their fears over the fallout of the war in Ukraine at the event. Polish survivor Zdzislawa Wlodarczyk said she was ""scared to hear what is happening in the East"". She told the audience that she had arrived in Auschwitz as an 11-year-old following the Warsaw Uprising, a failed attempt by the Polish resistance in 1944 to liberate the city from the German occupiers. She and her 7-year-old brother remained in the camp until the Soviet army liberated it. ""The Russian armies that liberated us are now waging war on Ukraine. Why? Why? That's what politics is,"" she said. The Polish nation has stood firm in its support for Ukraine during the conflict, with Poles housing hundreds of thousands of refugees in their own homes and offering military support to its neighbour. Russian officials have taken part in their own commemorative events, with Vladimir Putin meeting Russia's top rabbis on the eve of the remembrance day on Thursday. The Russian leader said he was ""pursuing a policy meaning nothing like this in the history of mankind will ever happen again"". Russia's Chief Rabbi Berel Lazar has spoken about his regret that Russia has been excluded from the commemoration, warning that ""these political games have no place on Holocaust day"". He told AFP: ""For us, this is clearly a humiliation because we perfectly know and remember the role of the Red [Soviet] Army in the liberation of Auschwitz and in the victory over Nazism."" Friday's event marks the 78th anniversary of the Soviet army liberating the concentration and extermination camp in German-occupied Poland, where more than one million people were murdered by the Nazis.  Auschwitz-Birkenau was created as a part of the Holocaust, a process that started with discrimination against Jewish people, and ended with six million Jews being killed because of who they were. In total, 1.1 million people died in the camp, around one million Jews from across Europe as well as Poles, Soviet POWs, Roma and Sinti.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64429625
Ukraine war: Zelensky's government launches anti-corruption drive,"It's been a political reshuffle with a difference. At the time of typing this, 11 officials have either resigned or been sacked as Kyiv tries to tackle government corruption.  It's led to some politicians in the US calling for aid to Ukraine to be restricted. President Volodymyr Zelensky is trying to quickly restore public faith, but the allegations are serious, and the timing is bad. Several claims have surfaced thanks to Mykhaylo Tkach, an investigative journalist for the news website Ukrayinska Pravda. He has recently reported that the company of a senior official's personal trainer allegedly received millions of pounds since the full-scale invasion, as well as a story about President Zelensky's deputy head of office. Kyrylo Tymoshenko quit two months after Tkach reported that he'd moved his family to the mansion of a well-known property developer. The journalist also published footage which appeared to show the official driving an expensive Porsche for a few months. Mr Tymoshenko has denied doing anything wrong.  ""Quite often, with MPs and officials, if the source of their money isn't clear, they register assets to people close to them,"" explains Tkach. ""These are signs of non-transparency, at a time when every step of an official should be clear for society."" The reporter concedes corruption exists in many countries. It's why he thinks the reaction to it is most important. From her bakery in Vorzel, near Kyiv, Ivanna is less than impressed with her government being accused of agreeing to pay inflated prices to an unknown firm, a deputy minister allegedly accepting a bribe worth £300,000 ($372,000), and an official's expensive taste in cars. ""I don't like it,"" she says, while her husband Vyacheslav stirs dough in the back room. ""It would be better for this money to go towards something good for Ukraine."" She pauses: ""We need to replace all those politicians who've been there for many years. They've got used to it; it feeds them."" For Ukraine, receiving billions of dollars in military, humanitarian and financial aid brings responsibility and scrutiny. It also increases the likelihood of money ending up in the wrong hands. ""We are talking about Ukraine's existence,"" says Tkach. ""It's not just some ordinary year for our country. So, I think this wave of resignations, initiated by the president, is an important acknowledgement and necessary action."" Ever since Ukraine declared independence 31 years ago, corruption has plagued its public services and most of all its politics. In 2014, a popular revolution toppled the last Moscow-leaning government because people wanted to finally live under a democracy. Ever since, Ukraine has attempted a series of reforms, notably driven by Russia's subsequent campaign of aggression towards the country. Change was seen as essential to securing the West's continued support. New anti-corruption agencies were then set up, along with new systems for government spending, a new police force, and politicians were forced to disclose their wealth - often with eye-watering confessions. ""We wanted results,"" Yaroslav Yurchyshyn tells me. He's an MP and deputy head of the parliamentary anticorruption committee. ""Yes, we have some leftovers from corruption in the past, but at least now we are not silent about it. The next stop will be prevention."" Mr Yurchyshyn believes there's no better time to expose ministerial wrongdoing, even with Western help being put at risk. ""Western partners understand we have two wars,"" he says. ""The first is against Russia, then there's our internal war for the future of Ukraine."" Before the full-scale Russian invasion of February 2022, Western allies like the European Union and the US weren't happy with the pace of Kyiv's efforts to combat corruption. While it's not clear what the political damage of the 2023 allegations will be for President Zelensky, his response to them this time has been described as ""quick and decisive"" by the US. With more allegations expected to surface, he'll be hoping other supporters feel the same. Additional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Siobhan Leahy ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64401190

"Low immunity, overwhelmed hospitals fuel Covid-19 deaths in ageing Japan","Low immunity against Covid-19 and a growing population of frail elderly is driving a surge in coronavirus deaths in Japan which had, for a long time, upheld some of the strictest pandemic restrictions. Japan once boasted one of the lowest Covid mortality rates, but the figure has been trending upwards since the end of 2022.   It hit an all-time high on 20 January this year, surpassing the UK, US and South Korea, according to Oxford University's Our World in Data. Japan was largely closed to foreign visitors from 2020 till mid-June last year. It opened its borders cautiously - at first, travellers had to be part of a package tour, buy medical insurance, and be masked in all public places.  Some schoolchildren had meals in silence for over two years as schools imposed bans on lunchtime conversations.  As restrictions are eased, however, the population's low Covid immunity may be causing infections to spike, local health experts told the BBC. Most of the latest Covid fatalities are elderly people with underlying medical conditions, experts said. This contrasts with the initial spate of deaths that were due to pneumonia and were often treated in intensive care. ""It is also difficult to prevent these deaths by treatment,"" says Hitoshi Oshitani, one of Japan's leading virologists, adding that Covid was only the trigger.   ""Due to the emergence of immune-escaping variants and sub-variants and the waning of immunity, it is getting more difficult to prevent infections,"" he says.  ""Immune escape""  is when the human host's immune system becomes incapable of responding against an infectious agent. New versions of the Omicron variant are known to be masters of immune evasion. Before the Omicron variant struck, Covid deaths mostly occurred in cities like Tokyo and Osaka, but there are now cases across the country, said Dr Oshitani, who was once regional adviser to the WHO on communicable disease surveillance and response.  ""In smaller prefectures and rural areas, the proportion of the elderly population is even higher than the national average. This changing geographic pattern may also contribute to the increasing trend of deaths,"" he said. Japan is the oldest society in the world by various measures, and its share of elderly people has been increasing every year since 1950.  Elderly people who are getting infected in nursing homes or in community clusters are not receiving prompt treatment, says epidemiologist Kenji Shibuya, a director at the Foundation for Tokyo Policy Research.   Faster treatment can help, he says, but because of Japan's classification of Covid as a Class 2 or ""very dangerous"" illness, only government-designated hospitals can treat the infected. And they have been overwhelmed by the surging caseload.  Dr Shibuya has called for Covid to be downgraded and treated as a form of influenza, allowing all clinics and hospitals to treat patients who have the virus.  Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced earlier this month that the classification would be lowered, but only on 8 May. Experts, including Japan's top coronavirus adviser Shigeru Omi, have been calling for this since last year. Dr Oshitani and Dr Shibuya also say that the death rate could have been inflated by under-reporting of Covid cases due to asymptomatic infections and tweaks to physicians' reporting requirements last year. That said, Japan is one of few countries still providing daily Covid tallies.  Yasuharu Tokuda, a physician at the Health and Global Policy Institute, noted that the Japanese population's natural immunity - acquired through infection - had been low before the middle of last year. He says natural immunity is stronger than that obtained from vaccination - and so low infection rates have led to low immunity in Japan, which in turn is causing more deaths. Dr Oshitani pointed to a similar phenomenon in Australia, where the Covid death rate has been creeping up since it reopened borders early in 2022 after keeping them shut for two years.  Experts are divided on the trajectory of Covid in Japan. Dr Tokuda, for instance, believes future rates of infection and death will be lower.  Dr Oshitani, on the other hand, expects a bigger surge in deaths in the months ahead as affordable antiviral drugs are still not widely available.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64494095
'The Whale gives a voice to people like me',"Sean Crawford cried when he saw the trailer for new Hollywood film The Whale. He says the movie about a reclusive English teacher with severe obesity, played by Brendan Fraser, resonated with his life. Mirroring the plot of the film, Sean rapidly gained weight after someone close to him died. He now weighs 30 stone (190kg). The father-of-one from Athelstaneford in East Lothian says the film has given a voice to people in his situation. And he says there are many similarities between his life and that of the film's lead character, Charlie. ""He instructs a class from behind a computer because he is ashamed of his weight, I hid away from things because I was ashamed of mine,"" said Sean. ""The main focus is making sure our daughters turn out to be good human beings just in case we aren't there to see them grow up. ""I think people need to realise big people are human beings."" Brendan Fraser has been nominated for an Oscar for his role. His on-screen transformation was the result of heavy prosthetics, which he admitted was ""a challenge"", physically and emotionally. He said he hopes the film will help to ""end the bias against those who live with obesity"". Sean says health and depression are among the issues that can lead to weight gain. He said: ""I often get adults looking at me in disgust, kids stare and make comments - but I understand this is the innocence of youth. ""I so often hear people talk about the likes of anorexia and bulimia with a degree of sympathy, whereas obesity is frowned upon. ""Both are illnesses at the end of the day."" Sean said he had been a confident person before he started gaining weight. One of his best friends passed away in 2019, then two months later he took voluntary redundancy from his role as a maintenance supervisor after 12 years in the job. This was followed by the Covid lockdown, and he ended up out of work for a few years. In this time he became a bit of a hermit - and put on 12 stones (76kg) in 18 months. ""My doctor said if there was an award for putting on weight in the shortest space of time then he would give it to me,"" said Sean. ""I neglected my life and spent 99.9% of my time watching TV, eating and drinking fizzy juice. ""I don't sleep much so I have 18 to 19 hours a day to do this."" He went from working with 200 people every day to sitting on his own in his house. Sean said he gave up - particularly during lockdown, when he found the isolation very stressful. He started getting back pains and it became too painful to walk. He tried to find out how much he weighed, but there were no scales big enough at his doctor's surgery. He eventually got weighed at the hospital, and found that he weighed 30 stone (190kg). ""It was soul destroying and I lost all my confidence,"" he said. At the end of 2020, when his vacuum cleaner broke and he did not have enough money to replace it, a friend gave him a number for the charity DadsWork, which is funded by the National Lottery Community Fund. The community project in East Lothian provides support groups, positive parenting classes, workshops on the role of fathers, home visits, trips and outings for fathers and their children. They gave him a vacuum cleaner and told him about drop-in groups and workshops he could attend with his daughter. Sean, who is 5ft 11ins , said: ""I didn't know what they did but after meeting them I've seen them just about every week since. ""I started going to their drop-in groups and it was great to meet other dads and hear their stories and what they were struggling with. ""These sessions helped normalise struggles of fatherhood to me and now I realise that I'm not alone - and not the only one who may feel that they don't know what they're doing all of the time."" Sean said this had made him a better dad. He also now has a job volunteering as a supervisor in a food bank. ""DadsWork have really helped me be more productive with the time I spend with my daughter too,"" he added. He said they now do ""all sorts of things together"" and had been supported with swimming passes. ""My daughter loves it and it's helping me get into shape and get my confidence back,"" he said. Kevin Young, project manager of DadsWork, said the organisation was there to offer support. He said: ""Sean has made a remarkable turnaround. When we first met him he was low in confidence and self esteem and wouldn't go out. ""We have spent a lot of time building our relationship with him to establish trust. ""He has gone from the vacuum cleaner, which was a small thing but huge thing for his family, to engaging with us hugely."" Now Sean feels in a better place and hopes to lose weight so he can meet a new partner. ""I hate being on my own and I hate being lonely,"" he said. ""I'm in a terrible place with my weight and hate having my picture taken or looking at myself. ""But now I'm working again I feel ready to lose weight."" He also wants to see The Whale at the cinema. ""I'm desperate to see it,"" he added. ""I ended up in tears when I watched the trailer, I related to it so much.  ""I couldn't tell you the last time I wanted to see a film at the cinema but this one massively ties into my situation. ""I empathise with him and it also gives a voice to people in my position. ""He is a teacher and is helping society. It shows people benefitting from his life, as normally overweight people are hidden away and are not given the credit they are due.""

"Cancer: Urgent action needed amid NHS pressures, warns charity","The Covid-19 pandemic cannot continue being blamed for poor cancer care, a charity boss has said.  Judi Rhys, of Tenovus Cancer Care, said urgent action was needed to save lives when more people than ever are living with cancer in Wales. It comes as the Wales Cancer Network publishes a three-year plan to improve cancer outcomes and patient experience. But the group's clinical director warned the immediate priority would be maintaining current services. Prof Tom Crosby, clinical director for Wales Cancer Network, which was tasked by Wales' health minister to draw up the improvement plan, said the biggest pinch point at the moment was access to diagnostics. ""We're absolutely trying to shorten overall times for patients coming into the system being diagnosed and then being treated,"" he said. The improvement plan includes plans for rapid diagnostic centres to reduce the time patients spend waiting for tests and treatment. It also sets out commitments for a lung cancer screening service, remote dermatology services and for all patients to have a key worker by the end of March 2024, as well as a 24-hour advice and triage service for those being treated for cancer and to establish a patient forum by the end of March 2023. On average in November, people suspected of having cancer had to wait 18 days for a first appointment and 22 days for a first test. It was an average 29 days from point of suspicion to being told if they had cancer or not and an average 33 days from point of diagnosis to treatment starting. ""We hope that this year we will develop the first regional diagnostic centre and that is likely to be in south-east Wales,"" Prof Crosby said. ""We know that coming out of the pandemic, and through the winter that we've experienced, services are under huge pressure and I think it's maintaining those services and the quality of care we are delivering at the moment is the priority. ""But I think over the next two to three years we would want to then see us getting through that backlog and actually improving patient outcomes ultimately from cancer care."" More than 15,000 people a month in Wales have been referred with suspected cancer and about 88% later discover they do not have it. The latest figures showed on average, about 1,650 patients started their first cancer treatment each month. A plan to address cancer outcomes in Wales has long been called for by charities and politicians. Ms Rhys said a strategy was an important first step, but action was required. ""Our dedicated NHS colleagues have faced incredible challenges over recent years, which were only exacerbated by the pandemic,"" she said. ""More people will die - who may have otherwise survived - because of decisions made to stop the health service becoming overwhelmed. ""We have regressed, not progressed. While we know the health service is under great strain, it's time to stop blaming the pandemic. Cancer services need urgent attention."" Mal O'Donnell was first diagnosed with prostate cancer about 12 years ago, but three years ago the former painter and decorator from Cardiff was told it had spread to his bones. The 76-year-old said, since the pandemic, he feels staff are no longer able to provide the same type of care. ""I don't think they can give you that hand on the shoulder and ask: 'Are you alright, Mal?'"" ""I don't know if it's because they haven't got the time, which is probably true. Before I never felt like a name or number, but now I do,"" he said. ""You could no way blame the staff that's there. You can't do that, but you can blame the fact there's not enough of them. ""You go in there at the most emotional time of your life, facing the most horrendous time of your life and you need people there that understand you, that you can lean on. Not feeling alone is so important."" Lauren Fresa from Flintshire, who was diagnosed with bowel cancer two years ago, advised people to persist if they felt they were not being listened to. She said she faced discomfort for several months despite seeing a GP, culminating in calling an ambulance due to severe pain and undergoing emergency surgery. ""Looking back I wish I had been more pushy,"" she said, adding that a surgeon told her she could have died from a perforated bowel without having a stoma bag fitted. ""I think it's having that confidence to know something's not right and persist, although I stress it shouldn't have to be like that, we shouldn't have to advocate for ourselves. ""It shouldn't take, you know, screaming and shouting and throwing a tantrum to see a doctor or to be referred for services,"" she told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. Claire Birchall, manager of the Wales Cancer Network, acknowledged there had been a really difficult couple of years following the pandemic, but cancer was also a big challenge before Covid.  One of the big challenges will be the workforce, she said, where there are ""lots of vacancies"" and ""a very tired workforce"". Health minister Eluned Morgan said health boards ""have the money in their budgets - it's up to them to prioritise"". ""Over the past 10 years we've seen almost a doubling of the amount we spend on cancer, from £300m to £600m"". ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64458225
Long covid: Woman turns to photography for restoration,"A long Covid sufferer is using photography to help her live with the condition. Tania McCrea-Steele says she has had three Covid infections and 13 immobilising relapses since she first caught the virus in March 2020. The 47-year-old, from Wiltshire, said she struggled to get support on the NHS and could not afford to pay for private care. So she turned to wildlife and landscape photography as a restorative aid. ""It's trying to find a light among the darkness and photography is all about light. It's my source of inspiration,"" she told BBC Points West. Ms McCrea-Steele is among the estimated 2.1 million people (or 3.3% of the population) living with long Covid, according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS). Just over half a million (507,000) had been living with long Covid for more than two years, the ONS said. Ms McCrea-Steele said it has left her unable to walk or drive long distances and she has not travelled more than 35 miles from her house in Bradford-on-Avon since the pandemic began. She took an interest in photography in September 2022 after she wanted to begin documenting the country walks she used as a ""healing process"" and quickly began teaching herself the basics with YouTube videos. Initially, she used her iPhone before her parents gifted her a ""proper camera"". ""My journey towards recovery is ongoing but photography has helped me regain some resilience and hope,"" she said. ""Although photography alone cannot heal the physical damage caused by Covid, it ensures a focus on the present moment, encourages gentle exercise, supports a medically-proven practice known as pacing, and provides me with a sense of achievement and wellbeing during my very limited periods of full concentration."" The conservationist has yet to fully recover and has 30 different symptoms, the most debilitating of which are crippling fatigue, difficulty breathing, chest pain, heart palpitations and brain fog. She said that activities have ""greatly assisted my journey towards health and happiness and believe it could be of help to others dealing with long Covid but equally unable to access support"". More than 600 people from Swindon have been referred to a recently set up special medical unit dealing with Long Covid and its mental health impacts across Wiltshire.

'It is essential we remain vigilant on Covid-19',"Cambridge researchers are continuing to regularly take blood from more than 150 volunteers, to check those most at risk from Covid-19 are still being protected by vaccines.Jabs have been stopping most people getting severely ill, but hundreds of thousands remain vulnerable to the disease through illness or due to their age.One of earliest findings from their research, which has been taking place since the pandemic began, was that the vaccine was not very effective in people aged over 80, until they had their second dose.Prof Ravi Gupta, from the University of Cambridge's Department of Medicine, said he hoped the work would help scientists plan the next generation of vaccines.  The researchers have been using the volunteers' blood to check how well vaccines deal with new variants.Volunteer Jack Berry, from Haverhill in Suffolk, said: ""I lost family to Covid in the first wave, and I had Covid myself and my family has caught it. So I thought, if I can help out in my own little way, then other people can benefit from that.""Experts found the 22-year-old through a Cambridge invention called the NIHR BioResource, external.Made up of 200,000 volunteers, with 8,000 dedicated to Covid research, it has become an easy place for scientists to recruit people willing help. After blood has been given by a volunteer, it is carried about 400m (1,312ft) across the city's Biomedical Campus to a state-of-the art lab run by Prof Gupta.It is then spun quickly in a centrifuge until it separates into red blood cells at the bottom and yellow plasma at the top, where the antibodies from the vaccines live and do their work.By testing those antibodies against the coronavirus, they can check how well the vaccines are fighting off new variants. Prof Gupta said: ""Our focus really has been the elderly and individuals who are taking various drugs or who have had cancers who don't respond so well to vaccines, and really understanding how well their immune systems will respond to vaccines, especially as new variants come along.""It is absolutely essential that we remain vigilant on Covid-19, with specific risk groups.""

"Covid support measures 'saved 40,000 jobs'","Northern Ireland would have 40,000 fewer people in work if pandemic support measures had not been introduced, economists have estimated. Ulster University's Economic Policy Centre has attempted to quantify what would have happened if businesses and consumers were not helped. It estimates the output of the Northern Ireland economy would be 4.3% below its current level. It adds the economy would take a further two years to recover. The research is not intended to be a value-for-money assessment of individual measures. During the pandemic, the UK government and the Northern Ireland Executive introduced a range of supports. These included the furlough scheme where the government initially paid 80% of the wages of people who could not work due to pandemic restrictions. Almost 140,000 workers were furloughed in Northern Ireland at the scheme's peak. There were also various cash grant and tax reliefs for businesses and enhanced social security benefits. The Ulster University Economic Policy Centre (UUEPC) constructed a ""counterfactual"" with no government supports and with all public health restrictions being strictly enforced. It did this by drawing on previous research by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and others and by comparing Northern Ireland to economies which had fewer supports. However, the counterfactual estimates do not include the economic effects associated with the war in Ukraine. Gareth Hetherington, director of the UUEPC, said its analysis suggested that although the support was expensive ""the economic outcome in the absence of supports would have been much worse"". He added this was ""particularly so for sectors such as hospitality, arts and leisure and non-food retail"". But he said the patchy support for people in self-employment could have negative long-term consequences. This is because ""the furlough scheme was more effective at supporting employees than the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS) was at supporting the self-employed"".  ""The analysis suggests many self-employed individuals ceased trading to be employed in larger businesses,"" he said. ""This may have a longer term impact on business start-up activity and entrepreneurialism.""  The UUEPC is also sceptical of claims that the furlough and similar schemes have contributed to higher inflation. It said while the evidence was limited it was ""difficult to conclude that overgenerous schemes had a significant impact on inflation in late 2021"". ""It is more likely the impact of lockdowns on global supply chains had a more significant role in raising inflation prior to the energy and food price issues currently being experienced,"" he said. It also points to Bank of England data which suggested by the second quarter of 2022 much of the £200bn excess savings accumulated during lockdown remained unspent.

Covid: Powys doctor given nine-month ban for false claims,"A private doctor who put false claims about Covid-19 treatments online has been banned from practising for nine months after a medical tribunal. Sarah Myhill, based in Powys, posted videos and articles advocating taking vitamins and other substances in high doses, without evidence they worked. The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service found her recommendations ""undermined public health"".  She was also selling the substances she recommended on her website. The tribunal found some of her recommendations had the potential to cause ""serious harm"" and ""potentially fatal toxicity"". She did not attend the hearing in Manchester. The tribunal was told she uploaded a series of videos and articles between March and May 2020, describing substances as ""safe nutritional interventions"" which she said meant vaccinations were ""rendered irrelevant"".  But the substances she promoted were not universally safe and have potential serious health risks associated with them, the panel was told. There was also no evidence to suggest they would be effective.  Dr Myhill also discredited the use of face masks. The tribunal found Dr Myhill ""does not practice evidence-based medicine and may encourage false reassurance in her patients who may believe that they will not catch Covid-19 or other infections if they follow her advice"". Dr Myhill previously had a year-long ban lifted after a General Medical Council (GMC) investigation into her claims of being a ""pioneer"" in the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome. The tribunal additionally found Dr Myhill had put a patient with a potentially fractured hip at risk by failing to ensure they were taken to hospital and that her fitness to practise was also impaired as a result. The hearing was told there had been 30 previous GMC investigations into Dr Myhill, but none had resulted in findings of misconduct. The tribunal concluded: ""Given the circumstances of this case, it is necessary to protect members of the public and in the public interest to make an order suspending Dr Myhill's registration with immediate effect, to uphold and maintain professional standards and maintain public confidence in the profession.""

Covid in China: Officials say current wave is 'coming to an end',"Chinese health officials say the country's current wave of Covid-19 infections is ""coming to an end"". The number of severe Covid cases and deaths is trending downward, the country's Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a report. It also said there had been ""no obvious rebound"" during Lunar New Year holidays last week, where millions reunited for family gatherings. There have long been questions raised about China's Covid reporting. But experts say the decline reported now corresponds with the expected timing of an end to this major wave.  The virus tore through Chinese cities and towns after authorities lifted zero-Covid restrictions in December. However fever clinic visit rates have dropped over 90% through January and hospitalisation rates are down over 85%. Separately, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the pandemic remained a global emergency, saying it was too early to lift the highest level of alert which it declared three years ago.  It said the weekly Covid death rate had been rising in recent weeks and that more than 170,000 Covid-19-related deaths had been reported globally within the last eight weeks, adding that a lack of surveillance now made it more difficult to track down variants.  But the WHO acknowledged that the world was in a better position than during the peak of the Omicron wave a year ago.  Fears that the virus could surge again during the festive period have also not yet been realised. The CDC said: ""There has not been an obvious rebound in Covid cases during the Lunar New Year holidays.  ""In this time, no new variant has been discovered, and the country's current wave is coming to an end."" It also reported a sharp decline in the daily Covid death toll reported by hospitals - from a peak of 4,300 deaths on 4 January to 896 deaths on 23 January. Infectious diseases expert Hsu Li Yang told BBC News: ""This drop in deaths follows the decline in the first huge wave of cases after China relaxed its restrictions, which is understandable and has been seen in virtually every country experiencing a large Covid wave. ""We will know soon if the Lunar New Year celebrations will trigger another surge in China cases, but it is unlikely to match what was experienced in December and the earlier part of January 2023."" One of China's leading epidemiologists - and former head of the CDC - Zeng Guang had earlier this month warned that cases would surge in rural areas during the new year. BBC News has also found evidence of a considerable number of Covid-related deaths in China's rural regions, as the virus spread from big cities to more remote areas with older populations. However, the CDC said there had been no immediate spike following the festive period. It's estimated that 226 million passenger trips were taken during the Lunar New Year festive season from 22-27 January - a 70% increase from last year when pandemic restrictions were still in place across many parts of China.   According to CDC data, Covid deaths halved in consecutive weeks in January. A total of 12,658 deaths were recorded between 13-19 January, while 6,364 deaths were recorded the following week. In December, Beijing abruptly ended draconian Covid curbs that had seen millions of its citizens locked down over the past three years.  That led to a severe spike in Covid infections and deaths, with some experts estimating a majority of the population contracted Covid in the weeks following. A Peking University study said that as of 11 January, some 900 million people in China had been infected with the coronavirus, amid multiple reports of overcrowded hospitals and crematoria.   However, Chinese authorities initially maintained that there had only been seven deaths since the end of zero-Covid on 7 December, after narrowing its definition of what counts as a Covid death. The National Health Commission later reported almost 60,000 Covid-related deaths between 8 December and 12 January, after it began including deaths from underlying conditions as well as respiratory failure caused by Covid.  China's official Covid data is believed to be vastly underreported, and authorities stopped releasing daily caseload reports last month.  Beijing has said it has been sharing Covid data in ""a timely, open and transparent manner in accordance with the law.""

Coronavirus: Jersey's airport testing centre closes,"Government-provided public PCR testing for Covid-19 will stop in Jersey from Monday, with the closure of a testing centre at the airport. Since 2020, more than 1.1 million tests have been carried out at both the airport and harbour testing centres, the Public Health Department said.  Officials said the system had played a ""vital part in protecting the community"".  Free Lateral Flow Test (LFT) kits remain available to order online.  Islanders have been advised to do stay at home and do a LFT if they feel unwell.  If they tested positive, they should stay at home for at least five days and until they had been symptom-free for 48 hours, the government said. Professor Peter Bradley, director of Public Health, said: ""I would like to thank everyone, past and present, who has worked tirelessly over the last few years to deliver this testing programme. They have all been a vital part in protecting the community.  ""Although we are scaling down our response, Covid-19 is still with us and will be for the foreseeable future.""

"Wiltshire long Covid unit has more than 2,500 referrals","More than 2,500 people in Wiltshire have been referred to a special medical unit dealing with long Covid and its mental health impacts. Carol Langley-Johnson, from Wiltshire Health and Care partnership, said people's health has been severely impacted by the pandemic and lockdowns. The unit opened two years ago and serves Bath, Swindon and Wiltshire. In a 2020 survey, 55% of Swindon residents reported worsening of mental health as a result of the pandemic. Ms Langley-Johnson told councillors on Swindon Borough Council's adults' health, care and housing overview and scrutiny committee that this rose by another 2% in 2021, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). She said: ""We now have two years of data, and the unit has seen about 2,500 people, including 635 people in Swindon, and is getting about 25 referrals a month from the borough."" Ms Langley-Johnson added that in both surveys carried out younger people, people who lost their job or were unemployed, people with long term health conditions, those who were classified as clinically extremely vulnerable or were living with someone classified as clinically extremely vulnerable were more likely to report a worsening of their mental health.  Loneliness, uncertainty, anxiety and depression all took their toll during the years 2020 and 2021, she said. In Swindon a six week programme designed to target common symptoms of long Covid, such as cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, breathlessness and pain,  has been set up. The programme includes activity management and energy conservation, managing unhelpful thoughts that impede rehabilitation and recovery, stress management and relaxation training. ""Uncertainty for the future was a cause of concern for many respondents in the survey,"" Ms Langley-Johnson added. ""The impact of isolation and loneliness were juxtaposed with the threat of getting ill or spreading the virus through resuming normal activities and socialising with others."" She added that Covid-19 also affected people's cognitive ability. ""We see a large proportion of people come in with ""brain fog"" presenting almost like a brain injury not just anxiety and depression."" Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Thousands of NHS staff with long Covid risk losing their pay,"Thousands of NHS staff across the UK are facing pay cuts because of a change in Covid sickness policy. Analysis by BBC Panorama suggests that between 5,000 and 10,000 NHS workers could be off sick with long Covid. Unions are accusing the government of failing to support health staff who worked during the coronavirus pandemic.  The government says the Covid-19 public inquiry will examine these issues when it begins taking evidence in May.  Changes to special sick pay rules introduced during the pandemic mean that some NHS staff unable to work due to long Covid may soon no longer receive full pay. Enhanced provision ended last year. Many had a six-month transition, so expect their wages to go down soon. Rachel Hext is hoping she will get better after developing long Covid and being unable to work for more than two years. But really, she's not sure that she will ever be the same again.  The 35-year-old is a nurse at a small community hospital in Brixham, Devon. In October 2020, Rachel was caring for Covid patients. A few days later, she tested positive.  Her symptoms include chest pain, brain fog, fatigue, joint pain, allergies, heart problems, sinus issues and hearing loss. Rachel is still on full pay but a change in sickness rules means her salary is due to be cut in half at the end of February. She says she will be £1,000 a month worse off. She has applied for an NHS Injury Allowance, which could top up her pay, but doesn't know if she will get it.  The Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust says it can't comment because there is a legal claim, which it is defending. The trust's chief executive, Liz Davenport, adds: ""The health and wellbeing of our staff is our priority, and we are extremely grateful to all our colleagues in the NHS and care services who worked tirelessly during the pandemic to care for our patients."" Rachel says she's really worried about money.  She adds: ""I do appreciate the NHS can't pay us forever, but there's hope we can actually bring something back to the NHS again."" Forgotten Heroes of the Covid Front Line Catherine Burns meets NHS workers who are living with long Covid and struggling to return to work. They now face the prospect of having to retire early or even being sacked.  Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) At the start of the pandemic, the government brought in special Covid sick pay for staff directly employed by NHS Trusts. This meant that, if they got Covid, they would get full pay, however long they were off work.  This didn't include everyone. For example, GPs were not covered.  It was a temporary measure and the scheme ended last summer. There is some local discretion and the rules may vary depending on length of service and where you work in the UK.  But essentially, standard sick pay rules have come back for NHS staff. This means that some people have already seen their pay go down, with more to follow soon.  The NHS in England and Wales do not publish overall numbers for showing how many staff are off sick with long Covid. Northern Ireland's Department of Health told us its most recent figures show 0.6% of its health and care staff are off because of long Covid. In Scotland it's 0.3%. If these rates are reflected across the UK, it could mean that between 5,000 and 10,000 staff absent because of long Covid.  Panorama has spoken to other health workers who say they are in the same position as Rachel.  Some face losing their jobs.  Professor David Strain is the chair of the Board of Science at the British Medical Association (BMA) and says this makes him ""genuinely angry"". He explains: ""We've got a group of people that have put themselves forward to look after the population, they've been left with an illness and they're not being supported.  ""They're just in a no man's land."" He believes that health workers with long Covid should be allowed to focus on their recovery without money worries. Layla Moran chairs a cross-party group of politicians looking at how the pandemic was handled in the UK. She says other countries have already designated Covid as an occupational disease, entitling those affected to financial support.  She adds: ""We are falling behind our peers in our recognition of this as a real disease that needs proper recognition and compensation."" NHS guidelines encourage managers to support staff to return to work, with options like phased returns. A government spokesperson says: ""The Covid-19 inquiry has been set up to examine the government's response to the pandemic and we will respond openly and transparently to the inquiry. ""In total, we have invested £314 million to establish specialist services throughout England to direct people experiencing long Covid into the right treatment and rehabilitation services, including occupational health services."" But the government accepts that long Covid is having an impact on the NHS, contributing to workforce inactivity. The inquiry will start hearing evidence in May. It has a huge scope and could last for years. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-64405899
"Flybe: Cornwall flight cancellations 'a real shock', says councillor","Airline Flybe going into administration and cancelling all flights has come as a ""real shock"", a senior Cornwall councillor says. A statement on the airline's website said it had ceased trading. It relaunched in April last year after previously going bust in 2020. Flybe had routes to London and Manchester from Newquay. Cornwall Council's economy leader Louis Gardner said the authority would look to other airlines to expand services. Cornwall Airport Newquay it was ""saddened at the news"", adding that people should not travel ""unless you have made arrangements with another airline"". Seamus McCoy, who used Flybe regularly to travel between Newquay and London, told BBC Radio Cornwall: ""Every time I've flown, I've always thought: 'How are they making a profit?', because the planes have never been more than 50% full. ""I just really feel for the new crew they just took on literally last week."" Miriam Mead, who is in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil to visit family, told BBC Radio Cornwall she had been due to fly back to Cornwall from London next month, having booked the flight three months ago. She said: ""I only found out while scrolling on my phone at seven in the morning in Rio.""  She said she was still waiting to hear from Flybe, adding: ""It's disappointing that I've only a week to go and now I have to make alternative arrangements.""  Mr Gardner, who is a Newquay councillor as well as council portfolio holder for the economy, said the news was a ""real shock to us"". However, he added routes to London and to Manchester were still available. He said: ""We were hoping Flybe was to increase operations but that's obviously not going to be the case now.  ""We have nine other carriers flying 18 routes and we'll look to expand with other airlines.""

"NHS to leave Salisbury city hall after 290,000 vaccinations","The NHS is leaving a vaccination centre in Wiltshire after administering thousands of Covid vaccines there.  A total of 287,923 vaccinations have been given out at the City Hall in Salisbury, which hosts its last clinic on January 28.  During one Covid-19 wave in 2021, a total of 1,700 vaccinations-a-day were carried out.  Wiltshire Council will now look for other uses for the building. It failed in a recent bid for levelling up funds. The leader of the council, Richard Clewer, said: ""We are happy that we were able to work supporting our NHS colleagues using the hall as a vaccination centre.

Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us?,"What can statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales? Here we update some of the key weekly and monthly data for measuring the pandemic and also assess some of the key Covid-19 indicators over the past two years. We are now at a ""Covid stable"" stage of the pandemic, but a watch is still being kept on infection estimates and the numbers of people being admitted to hospital and deaths during the winter period. One in 55 people - 57,100 or 1.85% of the population - were estimated to have had Covid in the most recent week, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is a big drop on the week before, when it was 121,600. There have been falls now for the past three weeks following a sharp rise in December. Since summer 2020, the ONS has organised a weekly nose and throat swab survey involving thousands of households across Wales, which now sees people being sent test kits by post. It has become the most important tool to measure the level of infections, with the end of mass testing at the end of March 2022. Infections are estimated to be falling in other UK nations too. The estimates are that one in 60 people in England, one in 55 in Scotland and one in 30 in Northern Ireland have the virus. Wales is estimated to have a higher proportion of people with Covid than other UK nations and regions, apart from Northern Ireland and south west England and the East Midlands. The number of hospital patients testing positive for Covid by 24 January was 40% of the levels we saw at the same time the year before. Numbers are falling and peaked in late December, while few patients testing positive are being ""actively"" treated for Covid. We know about 95.5% of people are currently being treated primarily for other conditions and happen to test positive while in hospital or on admission.  The number of patients testing positive for Covid in hospital beds in Wales averaged 241 a day in the week to 24 January - down by a third on the week before and nearly two thirds on the month before. Of these, there were an average of 218 in acute beds, compared with 286 the week before. The vast majority continue to be ""incidental"" Covid patients, who happen to test positive in hospital. Only four (2%) of confirmed Covid patients in acute beds on 24 January were being primarily treated for the virus, with 178 patients in hospital being treated for other conditions. When we include patients with suspected Covid and those recovering, there were 570 people on average in hospital beds over the past week - 20% down on the week before. With other patients with other winter respiratory conditions, like flu and RSV, they make up 12% of hospital in-patients. There were an average of 316 patients recovering in the week ending 24 January, so they were no longer testing positive for Covid but were waiting for discharge or for a care package to become available. This can add to pressures on hospitals. Numbers in critical care with Covid are averaging seven a day, half the number of the week before. There are 25 times more non-Covid patients in critical care than patients with the virus.    Last April, there were 27 Covid patients in critical care, while in the second wave in 2020-21 it peaked at 150 patients. The mortality rate of critical care Covid patients, in the most recent study of 286 Welsh patients since January 2022, was about 32.9%, including those who died later on a general ward. About 69% had been discharged from hospital. The study also showed patients admitted in the past year who survived are spending less time in critical care than earlier in the pandemic.  The average age of those admitted so far in 2022 is 58, just over half are men and they are likely to be overweight. More than half are from more deprived parts of Wales. About 29% were under 50. The study, at a UK level, showed 61% of those Covid patients in critical care were unvaccinated in December 2021. Numbers of admissions of people testing positive for Covid are averaging four a day - the winter peak so far was 20 over Christmas. For the first time since the pandemic began, no Covid admissions were recorded on 24 January. The previous low had been just one admission on two days in May and June 2022. Covid-positive patients now only make up 0.4% of all admissions. About 4.5% of patients in acute hospital beds with Covid were being primarily or ""actively"" treated for the virus on average in the past week.  The average number has been 10 in the most recent week, down from 25 the week before. It does not mean these patients cannot have complications because of Covid and it can still present challenges for patient management. Broken down by health board, only three health boards, topped  by Cwm Taf Morgannwg, recorded numbers of patients testing positive who were being treated ""actively"" for Covid in the past week. There has been a higher proportion of patients with Covid being treated primarily for the virus in critical care - and that was one out of four acute patients on 24 January. The Icnarc intensive care study has found a far smaller proportion of critical care patients with Covid were being primarily treated for the virus after January 2022 (27%), compared to the period before (nearly 86%). The figures on ""incidental"" Covid cases have only been published in recent months. Digital Health and Care Wales indicated the data had no standard definition for ""actively being treated for Covid"", meaning there were some differences between health boards in how they arrived at the figure so we have to take a little care in how these are interpreted. Patients who are asymptomatic are no longer being tested routinely so this is another factor to consider. There were 146 positive tests for Covid in hospitals in the week ending 24 January, continuing the fall since the Christmas period. Public Health Wales figures show in the latest week, ""probably"" or ""definitely"" hospital-acquired cases in patients are about the same as those community-acquired or indeterminate Covid cases.  Hospital-acquired infections stood at 93 There have been more than 17,900 hospital-acquired infections recorded since the start of the pandemic. An indication of pressure on the NHS is overall bed occupancy in acute hospitals, which hit a high of 95% in the week ending 26 October. It remains close to the record, reaching 94.3% in the most recent seven days. We know that recent modelling from Welsh government scientists suggested in a ""worst case"" scenario that Covid, flu and other respiratory conditions could account for 2,750 hospital beds - or 28% of total capacity at the winter peak in 2022-23. The ""most likely"" scenario had been for 1,390 patients with Covid, flu and other respiratory conditions on 9 December, including 668 with confirmed positive tests for Covid. By 22 January it had passed its peak, with 793 patients with Covid, flu or RSV - or 9% of all in-patients in hospital beds. Patients with flu had dropped to their lowest levels since early December. About 65% of flu patients had picked up the virus while in hospital for something else, while 80% were over 60. There were 20 patients with flu in critical care. Modelling for Covid alone peaked at more than 1,800 patients with the virus in a ""worst case scenario"" in December. The actual curve for patients with Covid positive tests is now back on track with the ""most likely"" scenario after following a more undulating pattern, which had taken it closer to the ""optimistic"" scenario at one point. Scientific advisers with a more up to date projection at the end of November suggested hospital bed occupancy with Covid would continue to decline to December and reach a plateau in the following weeks. A slight increase in Covid admissions was projected towards the end of January and February. Another measure of pressure on the health service is NHS staff absence. A total of 0.5% of staff - about 570 - were absent due to Covid-related sickness in the week to 16 January. Another 0.1% of staff were having to self-isolate, according to the bi-monthly Welsh government figures. This does not include NHS Wales staff absent for other reasons.  Total absence stands at 5.8%, higher than the usual pre-pandemic figure of about 5%. The quarterly average to June was 6.6%, down from 7.2% in the three months to March, which was the second highest rate on record. Data from the latest infection survey from the Office for National Statistics suggests 97.1% of adults in Wales have some protection from antibodies - through vaccination or immunity following infection. The estimate is 95.7% of 16 to 24-year-olds in Wales would have tested positive for antibodies. At the higher threshold, 79.7% of adults in Wales are at or above 800 nanograms per millilitre and nearly three quarters in those aged 16 to 24 and 95.3% of the 75-79 age group. As part of its weekly swab survey, involving many thousands of people across the UK, some participants also have their level of antibodies checked in a blood test and are also asked a series of other questions towards fact-finding about Covid. Scientific advisers to the Welsh government said 0.6% of people aged 12 and over were estimated to be at risk of going to hospital with Covid at the start of April 2022, compared with 9.3% two years before, at the start of the pandemic. And for those at-risk groups, 6% were estimated to be at risk of needing hospital treatment and 7% of the over 60s. This is thanks to vaccination and natural protection from immunity after having infection. The rate at which GPs are consulted about Covid-19 is also another indicator, which peaked in the first week of January 2022 at 98 consultations per 100,000 and has now fallen back to around one per 100,000 a year later.  The number of people who have died when Covid was a contributory factor has reached 11,374 in Wales, for registrations so far. In the most recent week, up to 13 January, 70 people in Wales had a death registered which involved Covid-19 and saw it included as a contributory factor on their death certificate, according to the ONS. This compared to 57 in the week before and is the highest weekly total since April 2022. There were no Covid deaths in only three local authorities: Denbighshire, Merthyr Tydfil and Monmouthshire. When counted by day occurring - not day registered - there were 44 deaths involving Covid in the past week registered so far, compared to 56 in the previous week. However, the most recent weekly figures are usually an underestimate, due to delays in registrations catching up. ONS says that up to the end of December, of deaths registered so far, there have been 9,374 deaths due to Covid, with the virus the underlying cause of death. The pattern for deaths remained fairly low in 2022, although the summer heatwave brought a peak of 27 deaths between 18-19 July 2022, the most since January.   The ONS measure includes deaths in people's homes, hospices and other settings, as well as hospitals and care homes. Covid's second wave in the winter of 2020-21 brought 83 deaths on 11 January 2021 alone - the worst single day during the pandemic in Wales. ONS also records so-called ""excess deaths"". This has been seen as a useful measure of the pandemic's impact because it looks at deaths from all causes overall, compared with the five-year, non-pandemic average. So since March 2020, there have been 9,114 more deaths than we might expect to see on average. That includes nearly 2,000 excess deaths since July 2022. There have been 1,704 deaths from all causes above the non-pandemic average since July 2022 alone, with more than a thousand not involving Covid. Deaths have been above the five-year pre-pandemic norm for all but two of the last 31 weeks. There were 1,183 deaths from all causes - this is 264 more (28.7%) than the average in the most recent week.  Covid accounted for 5.9% of all deaths in Wales in the latest week, slightly more than the proportion in England (5.3%). Across England and Wales, with 70.9% of deaths with Covid mentioned on the death certificate, it was also the underlying cause of death in the latest week. Nearly a fifth (18%) of all Covid deaths registered have occurred in care homes. There were 12 deaths involving Covid involving a care home resident registered in the latest week - out of 223 deaths overall. Care Inspectorate Wales reports that deaths peaked in May 2020 and said it has been notified of 2,284 care home resident deaths with suspected or confirmed Covid since the pandemic began. It had been notified of 17 deaths involving Covid so far in 2022. ONS analysis of deaths in care homes in 2021 found mortality rates lower in Wales in men than in England or any English region. Covid was the second highest cause of death in care home residents after dementia, accounting for 12.9% of male resident deaths and 11.1% of female resident deaths. Covid-19 was the eighth leading cause of death in Wales in December, after being the ninth leading cause in November. Mortality analysis by the ONS showed deaths due to Covid - 92 in total occurred over the month - accounted for 2.7% of all registered deaths.  Looking at when Covid was a contributory factor, there were 128 deaths involving Covid in Wales - or 3.7% of all deaths registered in December. Dementia was again the leading cause of death in December in Wales, for the fifth consecutive month - however heart disease ranked as the leading cause of death for the whole of 2022.  Flu and pneumonia again ranked fourth, ahead of Covid, with its mortality rate for a fourth month in succession. Covid was the seventh leading cause of death in 2022, with a mortality rate of 38.5 deaths per 100,000, after being the second leading cause of death in Wales after heart disease in 2021 and the leading cause of death at the height of the pandemic in 2020. The ONS analysis of excess deaths - the number of deaths above what we might normally expect to see - found deaths were 5% above average in Wales in 2022, but when adjusted for age and population, the rate was 1.1% below average. It was 0.7% below average in England. The leading cause of these excess deaths was symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions, which include old age and frailty. There were 231 of these deaths above normal levels (more than 30% above average). These factors were also the most common pre-existing conditions in nearly 30% of deaths due to Covid. But there were 537 fewer deaths from flu and pneumonia in Wales than normal (27.9% below average). The ONS, which takes into account population and age structure, found the mortality rate for deaths due to Covid in Wales in December was 30.1 deaths per 100,000 - an increase on November's figure.  Across the course of the pandemic, the age-standardised mortality rate for deaths involving Covid is slightly higher in Wales (115.3 deaths per 100,000), than England on 114.7 deaths per 100,000, with Scotland (107) and Northern Ireland (106.4) both lower in the 34 months to the end of November. The age-standardised mortality rate due to Covid - with Covid the underlying cause of death - is slightly higher in England than in Wales. It is also higher in all English regions apart from south west, south east and east England. When a crude mortality rate, not adjusting for the age or population profile, is used, deaths are higher in Wales. The ONS also looks at how deaths are registered on certificates and found Covid was the underlying cause of death - not just a contributory factor - in 72% of Covid deaths mentioned by doctors on death certificate in Wales in December.  It has been as high as 94% and on average since the start of the pandemic, 83.3% of deaths with Covid on death certificates can be said to be due to Covid since the pandemic began. So, there were 9,374 deaths due to Covid by the end of 2022 in Wales, 54% of them male. In about 4% of these deaths, the doctor had written that Covid was ""suspected"". A doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution.  Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) has the highest mortality rate over the course of the pandemic in Wales. By 6 January, RCT had reached a total of 1,160 deaths and also had the eighth highest crude mortality rate (488 deaths per 100,000) of all local authorities across England and Wales. Merthyr Tydfil (481.3 deaths per 100,000) was the ninth highest and Bridgend 15th (464.6 deaths per 100,000). RCT has overtaken Cardiff (1,145) for the most deaths in Wales up to 30 December. Six of RCT's communities were also in the highest 20 within Wales during the first and second waves, when the death rates can be broken down further. At a health board level, the age-standardised mortality rate for Cwm Taf Morgannwg, which covers RCT, Merthyr and Bridgend, was 149.7 deaths per 100,000 due to Covid in the pandemic up to the end of November 2022.  This is the highest in Wales, the lowest being 62.4 deaths due to Covid in the Powys health board area, set against a Welsh average of 98.2. The community with the highest number of Covid deaths across 2020 and 2021, including in the first two waves of the pandemic, was Tonyrefail West, with a total of 63 deaths due to Covid. This was followed by Sandfields in Port Talbot and Porth East and Ynyshir in Rhondda Cynon Taf (55 deaths each), by the end of 2021. When translated into mortality rates, based on population size, Gwersyllt West and Summerhill in Wrexham was the highest at 742.6 deaths per 100,000 - or 44 deaths over the two years. This was followed by Tonyrefail West, Port Talbot East and Llanelli Bigyn in Carmarthenshire. All communities of Wales have now had at least two deaths during the pandemic. The lowest number of deaths at a community level were in Aberystwyth North and Aberystwyth South, Bangor City and Llandudno Junction South and Llansanffraid Glan Conwy. At a local authority level, in the second wave of the pandemic, Bridgend was the worst-hit area in Wales. In 2021, Bridgend had the highest Covid mortality rate - 271 deaths or 183.2 deaths per 100,000; this was the 24th highest area across England and Wales. There are figures to compare relative excess deaths in different European countries. Bulgaria has the highest relative cumulative age-standardised mortality rate - 18.2% higher than normal - and Norway the lowest, 4.1% below average. Wales was 3.7% above average in June 2021 and then 2.1% above average in July 2022 - ranked 21st out of 33 nations. For those aged under 65, Wales was 4.8% above average (ranked 12th) and 1.5% above average (joint 24th) in the over-65s.   Wales also saw excess mortality in more than half of weeks over the period. Nearly 8.6m doses of Covid vaccine have been administered in Wales since December 2020. The vast majority in recent weeks have been autumn boosters, although the programme is now down to a comparative trickle. So far, more than 1.1m autumn boosters have been given out, reaching more than 88% of care home residents and 81% of over 65s.  More than 58% of those aged 50 to 64 have also had autumn boosters. Wales has reached proportionately more of key groups with autumn boosters than England, although fewer than Scotland. There are also fewer of the key groups reached than the earlier phases of the programme. The boosters were reaching fewer elderly people from black and ethnic minorities, with the gap widest in the over 80s - just 40% compared to 54% of white over 80s by early October. The previous booster campaign saw 85% of those eligible being given a dose. Public Health Wales is now only reporting Covid vaccination figures weekly. The dominant variant in Wales was Omicron in 2022, and 1,500 new cases have been sequenced in the last month. Because of the ending of mass testing in April 2022, we should not expect to see the same numbers of results going off for sequencing any more. So far, 29,265 cases of a sub-variant of Omicron, BA.2, have been recorded in Wales but very few cases in recent months. It overtook the ""original"" Omicron in all areas of Wales but this sub-variant itself has been overtaken by other sub-variants, especially BA.5. There have been 41 cases of the new sub-variant BQ.1 again in the last week - related to the BA.5 strain. Infection estimates by ONS suggest BA.5 overtook the BA.1 strain in early March 2022, while the following BA.4 and BA.5 strains overtook BA.2 in the second week of June in Wales. Health officials say the BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants are six times more transmissible than the original Wuhan Covid strain but that vaccines were still working to prevent serious illness in most people. The numbers of people who are reporting they have long Covid symptoms in Wales a year after being infected are estimated to be at record levels.  There are 63,000 people -  or 2% of the population - who are estimated to still be suffering symptoms 12 months or more since having Covid. A total of 111,000 people were estimated to have long Covid at any duration. Of these, 18% said it had ""a lot"" of impact on their daily lives. An estimated 3.6% of people in Wales report having long Covid - this is slightly more than in Scotland and Northern Ireland and higher than all regions of England except the North East. Just over 2% reported long Covid after a year - more than other UK nations and English regions apart from North East and North West. The estimates are based on a sample size of 14,000 people in Wales. Across the UK, prevalence was greatest in the 35 to 69 age group, in women, and in people living in deprived areas. A survey of more than 1,600 people with long Covid in Wales referred to the Adferiad recovery programme found around 70% were female and half were aged over 50. Of those needing follow-up, around a quarter had hospital treatment. Average stays were around two weeks. Fatigue, ""brain fog"" and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms. Scientific advisers for the Welsh government estimate that potentially up to a quarter of people who have Covid may develop long Covid. In January 2022, this would have included far higher proportions of Covid cases involving people aged between 50 and 70 - an estimated 43% of those with Covid. But even if 6% of young people under 25 with Covid developed long-term symptoms, this could still mean more than 2,200 young people with long Covid in Wales. This analysis was used to develop a ""social cost"" estimate for Covid, which looked at the cost to the NHS of treating Covid at different stages of the pandemic. With the effects of the vaccine, and less patient time in hospital and intensive care, it meant this estimated cost had fallen from £21,000 per case in the second wave of the pandemic to £5,769 per case by January 2022. Of this, more than £4,800 per case would be the cost of long Covid. When we look at infections in communities, broken down into middle-layer super output areas, with populations averaging 5,000, there has generally a split between rural and more urban areas. This is still noticeable when we look at a map of community case rates for the whole pandemic, taking into account population sizes. The Wales positivity rate was around 18% by the end of 2022 but there were far fewer PCR tests after the end of mass testing in April. At the peak of the Omicron wave at the end of 2021, the positivity rate reached 51.6%. Locally, Neath Port Talbot over the course of the whole pandemic had the highest positivity rate (18.8%) and Ceredigion the lowest. Earlier in the pandemic, a 5% positivity threshold was suggested by the World Health Organisation as an indicator that infections were too high. There was a much younger profile to cases in the third wave in the latter half of 2021. Between January and March 2022 there was a rise in proportions of those aged 20 to 40 testing positive.  In terms of PCR tests, the 20 to 40 age group made up more than 41% of positive results in winter 2021-22. All of Wales' 22 council areas saw falls in their under-25 case rates in the last week of figures, which included the period when mass testing ended.  The 30 to 39 age group had the largest proportion of cases in the last, most reliable week for PCR tests. Over the 2021-22 winter months, the under-19 age group made up 20% of cases, a rise on the year before. The so-called R-number - the reproduction number - had been a tool to express the infection rate of Covid. However, it is has now been phased out as a measure. Expressed within a range, if it was above 1, this indicated that infections were growing.  The range for the last estimate in December 2022 was between 0.9 and 1.2, suggesting infections were rising. So, for every 10 people with Covid in Wales, between another nine and 12 people would be infected. More than 8.7 million Covid-19 tests have been carried out during the pandemic, with the first positive result recorded in Swansea on 27 February 2020. For most of the first wave, testing was confined to hospitals and some care homes but mass testing became available in the spring of 2020. This ended at the start of April 2022, although it will remain in place for hospital patients and there will be some for vulnerable people and those with symptoms in care homes. There are around 4,500 PCR tests currently taking place each week, compared to around 200,000 a week at the pandemic's peak. Testing that's processed privately - at so-called Lighthouse labs - is no longer taking place. Free lateral flow tests (LFTs) are no longer available, except to certain groups and in certain settings. From the summer of 2021, and with the easing of restrictions, they had been used more for asymptomatic people going to work or attending events. Then between April and July 2022, people with symptoms were asked to take LFTs. The number reporting tests had been falling as a result of the end of freely-available LFT kits. Lateral flow test results have not been reported since the end of November 2022. Up to the end of routine testing in April 2022, about 17,000 PCR tests routinely took place in hospitals each week and up to 30,000 weekly in care homes.  There have also now been changes to guidance for Covid testing in hospitals, although patients will still be tested before admission or ahead of surgery or chemotherapy. Since the end of mass testing, only about 4,000-6,000 PCR tests are being carried out each week. Altogether, around 32,500 positive results were recorded in care homes over the course of the routine testing programme from autumn 2020. Care home staff no longer need to take a weekly PCR test, while free lateral flow tests will only be provided in limited circumstances. Care Inspectorate Wales figures also show 16 care homes in Wales have notified one or more confirmed cases of Covid in the last week. School absences for Covid-related reasons are no longer being recorded.  We saw over the 2021-22 academic year, 69.1% of pupils missed at least half a day's schooling because of Covid. Meanwhile, absence in general was much higher than in previous years - running at an average of 11% in primary-aged pupils and 16.3% in secondary-aged children during the 2021-22 academic year. This was more than twice the absence rate in pre-pandemic years. Analysis of these figures showed 10% were persistently absent - and this rose to 21% of those from poorer backgrounds. In the financial year ending in March 2021, the first year of the pandemic, spending on infectious diseases in the NHS in Wales jumped by £373 million. That worked out at £156 per person in Wales, or just under 6% of all NHS Wales spending. The costing of treating patients with Covid and managing the virus was put at £628m. Spending also included field hospitals and operating the track and trace system. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-52380643
Covid booster not taken up by 41% of over 50s in Jersey,"A government report says four in 10 islanders over the age of 50 have not received a Covid-19 autumn booster. The vaccine team has administered 26,959 boosters since the scheme was launched in September 2022. The report said 59% of those over 50 had taken up the offer of a fifth dose of vaccine. Dr Cheryl Walter said it was important for islanders to protect themselves from the virus. She said: ""If you were in that first bunch where everyone was offered a booster and you've just forgotten about it, you can walk in and go and get that third booster. ""It's never too late and if you think it's too late or it's not effective, it's protecting you, it's protecting people around you, go and get it done, it takes about 10 minutes."" The report found 93% of the population aged 18 and over had received their first dose, 92% had been double vaccinated, and 75% had received a third dose. A total of 67% of 16-17 year olds, 53% of 12-15 year olds and 7% of 5-11 year olds have received their first dose. Follow BBC Jersey on Twitter and Facebook.

Bharat Biotech: India launches its first nasal Covid vaccine,"India has approved its first nasal Covid vaccine. Made by Bharat Biotech, iNCOVACC is administered in the form of drops and stimulates an immune response in the tissues that line the nasal cavity. In September 2022, China had approved an inhaled Covid vaccine, administered in the form or a spray. Scientists say that nasal vaccines may offer added immunity in the lining of the nose and upper airways, where Covid typically enters the body. Research teams in the UK and the US have also been investigating nasal spray vaccines. In November, India's drug regulator approved the use of iNCOVACC as a heterologous booster dose -  a booster for people who had previously received two doses of Covishied or Covaxin, the two main Indian vaccines - in emergency situations among adults.  In December, it was approved by the drug regulator as a primary vaccine and as a subsequent booster shot in adults. The vaccine will cost 800 rupees ($10; £8) per dose in private hospitals and 325 rupees per dose in government hospitals and can be booked on the government's online platform. Two doses are to be taken 28 days apart. iNCOVACC uses a adenovirus as a carrier for the genetic code that teaches the body how to fight the infection. Adenoviruses used in the vaccines are harmless transporters which have been modified so they cannot replicate or cause infection. Dr Krishna Ella, chairman of Bharat Biotech, told ANI news agency that the vaccine was ""easy to deliver"" as it didn't need a syringe or needle, and that it produced a broader immune response as compared to injectable Covid vaccines.  India has administered over two billion Covid jabs so far. More than 70% of the Indian population has taken at least two doses, according to the federal health ministry. In January 2022, India began giving boosters to healthcare and frontline workers, and those above 60 years with comorbidities. It was later expanded to all adults. However, the pace of booster doses administrated has been slow. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-64421961
Andrew Bridgen threatens to sue Matt Hancock in Covid vaccine row,"Andrew Bridgen is threatening to sue fellow MP Matt Hancock after the former health secretary accused him on Twitter of ""antisemitic, anti-vax, anti-scientific conspiracy theories"".  Mr Bridgen was suspended as a Tory MP over a tweet likening the impact of Covid vaccines to the Holocaust.  A letter sent on his behalf is claiming £100,000 in libel damages.  Mr Hancock - who had the Tory whip removed for his reality TV appearance - is standing by his comments. The dispute centres on tweets posted by the two independent MPs on 11 January. Above another Twitter message questioning the safety of Covid vaccines, Mr Bridgen wrote: ""As one consultant cardiologist said to me, this is the biggest crime against humanity since the Holocaust.""  Mr Hancock tweeted that ""disgusting and dangerous antisemitic, anti-vax, anti-scientific conspiracy theories spouted by a sitting MP this morning are unacceptable and have absolutely no place in our society"". His tweet was posted with a clip of himself asking a similarly-worded question during Prime Minister's Questions earlier that day.  In the Commons, Rishi Sunak condemned Mr Bridgen's comments as ""utterly unacceptable"". On the same day, the North West Leicestershire MP lost the Tory whip pending a formal investigation.  Chief Whip Simon Hart said: ""The vaccine is the best defence against Covid that we have.  ""Misinformation about the vaccine causes harm and costs lives.""  Mr Bridgen said he was ""saddened"" about his suspension, but defended his original post.  He argued it was ""in no way antisemitic"" and added he would continue to ask ""reasonable questions"" about Covid vaccines. A ""letter before action"" has been sent on Mr Bridgen's behalf by a group called The Bad Law Project, with the support of the Reclaim Party, led by actor and activist Laurence Fox.  According to the letter, Mr Bridgen believes the former health secretary's words were defamatory. He is calling on Mr Hancock to retract and delete his statement, apologise in the Commons and on Twitter, and pay £100,000into a legal fund for people seeking vaccine damages.  A spokesperson for Matt Hancock said: ""What Matt said was obviously not libellous and he stands by his comments.  ""Rather than wasting his time and money on an absurd libel case he will undoubtedly lose, let's hope Bridgen does the right thing and apologises for the hurt he's caused and keeps his offensive view to himself in future."" Mr Hancock is also an independent MP. In November, he had the Conservative whip suspended for joining the cast of the ITV show, I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! while Parliament was sitting.   The MP for West Suffolk, 44, announced last month that he would not stand again at the next general election.  At the height of the Covid pandemic, he was a prominent figure in news conferences and media interviews, frequently speaking for the government when he was health secretary.   He was forced to resign in June 2021, when images emerged of him kissing adviser Gina Coladangelo, in breach of social distancing guidelines.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64414637
Covid: No new hospital admissions in Wales as flu levels fall,"No hospital admissions of patients with Covid-19 were recorded in Wales for the first time since the start of the pandemic, according to the latest data. Cases of seasonal flu in Wales are also at their lowest levels since October, the latest weekly figures from Public Health Wales (PHW) showed. Hospital inpatient cases of flu and other acute respiratory infections are falling after an early January peak. Only one patient was being treated primarily for Covid in critical care. In the first week of January, about one in five patients in hospital had an acute respiratory infection (ARI) - either flu, Covid or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Numbers in hospital beds peaked at 1,900 but have dropped for two consecutive weeks. ARI patients now make up about 9% of those in hospital. This will ease pressure on hospitals, which have been facing rising demand at the front doors and with about 1,000 patients at any one time ready for discharge but delayed because support packages or care home beds are not ready. The number of patients testing positive for Covid has also been falling steadily. For the first since the pandemic began, no admissions of patients with Covid were recorded on 24 January. The previous low had been just one admission on two days in May and June 2022. The number of patients testing positive for Covid in hospital beds in Wales averaged 241 a day in the week to 24 January - down by a third on the week before and nearly two thirds on the month before. Digital Health and Care Wales figures also show that on Tuesday only four (2%) of confirmed Covid patients in acute beds were being primarily treated for the virus, with 178 patients in hospital with Covid being treated for other conditions. Only one patient was primarily being treated for Covid in critical care or on ventilation. The picture in the community showed flu cases were falling, although Public Health Wales said the virus was still circulating. There were 68 flu cases reported - the lowest weekly total since mid-October - and fewer people were calling NHS 111 for advice about symptoms. The GP consultation rate for flu has also dropped below the low intensity threshold. Consultation rates with GPs remain highest in those aged 35 to 44 years. Incidences of RSV in children under five years of age - which has been at very high intensity levels in December - is back at low levels. Scarlet fever cases, although higher than normal, have also fallen. Cases of the invasive form of the Strep A bacterial infection have also fallen in the latest week and public health officials say they remain rare. There have been five deaths of children under 15 since last September in Wales and 29 deaths in the same age group in England. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64413961
Immensa Covid test lab concerns ignored by Test and Trace,"Concerns raised about dangerous discrepancies at a Covid testing lab which has since been blamed for causing an estimated 23 deaths were ignored by health officials for months. Documents show Public Health Wales flagged ""significant concerns"" about results from Immensa, in Wolverhampton, in letters to colleagues in England. They were told nothing was wrong and testing resumed in September 2021. Letters were released after a Freedom of Information request by the Times. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said as many as 39,000 positive results were wrongly reported as negative in September and October 2021, mostly originating from south-west England. It found opportunities were missed in its Test and Trace's investigations which led to a delay in identifying the problem. But it concluded no single action could have prevented the errors. However, the newly-released documents show health officials in Wales alerted Test and Trace to the possibility of inaccurate results in February 2021 after they found the positivity rate was more than five times higher than elsewhere - raising the possibility of contamination. Test and Trace responded to say an internal audit had found ""no evidence"" of discrepancies. But concerns in Wales were so acute, health staff halted sending any more of their Covid tests to Immensa in March that year. They said their analysis showed 6,377 out of 39,694 results appeared to have been wrongly reported. Amber Marshall, of Gloucester, whose grandmother Pan Bembenek died from Covid after her care worker was given a false negative result, said she was ""incredulous"" at the revelations.  ""It does seem to be a bit of an exercise in British politeness and understatement saying 'could you possibly look into this a bit more, the results seem a bit surprising' when what they mean is 'the results are clearly wrong, something needs to be looked at'."" Immensa was paid more than £100m to carry out Covid testing for the NHS during the pandemic. The UKHSA said a total of about 400,000 samples had been processed at the lab in the West Midlands. The BBC asked the director of labs at Test and Trace at the time if she would like to comment. But Prof Dame Anna Dominiczak referred us to a statement by the UKHSA which said measures had been taken to prevent a repeat of the mistakes. Prof Alan McNally, who set up the lighthouse labs during the pandemic, said there had been a failure to involve people with appropriate expertise in quality control. He said there should have been an ""in-depth investigation of why the data was fluctuating so wildly, and how they were calling results and whether or not that was robust enough"". Richard Gleave, director and lead investigator for the Immensa probe at UKHSA, said: ""Our report has already clearly set out the concerns that Public Health Wales raised with NHS Test and Trace in February 2021, and the NHS Test and Trace response in March 2021. ""When we discovered the issues with Immensa, we took action to implement improvements to reduce the risk of incidents like this happening again and are working closely with our counterparts in other UK countries to ensure any future concerns are addressed and investigated rapidly.""

What can Cambridge learn from Gothenburg's congestion charge?,"Gothenburg, Sweden's second city, is ringed by 38 sets of cameras, silently raising around £70m a year in taxes. A decade on since Gothenburg introduced its congestion charge, what has it meant both for the city's inhabitants and the British cities, such as Cambridge, considering similar plans? Bernadette Johansson feels like she is being punished.  Her husband Lars-Gunnar wants more carrot and less stick.  They are discussing Gothenburg's congestion charge - a system which which still attracts criticism 10 years on. ""I think it's very good that cities are thinking about the environment, but we can't be punished all the time,"" Bernadette says, sitting in her kitchen overlooking a lake in the countryside about 30 minutes from the city centre. Sometimes she has ""no alternative"" but to drive into the city because public transport is neither cheaper nor more convenient, Bernadette says. Bernadette, 69, who moved to Sweden from her Essex home 35 years ago, added: ""I have to go for hospital visits, dental visits, all those kind of things.  ""I can't spend four or five hours [on buses] getting to a dental or hospital appointment. ""I think it's unfair,"" she says. ""I think people are being punished. They're not making it easy for people [who drive their own, rather than company, cars] to get into town."" Lars-Gunnar served as a Gothenburg police officer for 44 years. He says he supports environmental issues ""but to me it's a way for the government to get some money"".  ""I feel for shop owners that are inside [the charging zone] and are struggling a bit because people choose to go to the places where they can park for free and there are no charges."" If this all sounds familiar, it could be because similar fears have been raised about proposals for Cambridge's Sustainable Travel Zone or congestion charge, which could see similar cameras on the city's streets with the aim of raising £50m a year for bus, cycling and walking improvements. What would the Johanssons write on a postcard to Cambridge? ""To get the infrastructure correct - think about the private person, think about the pensioners and make it attractive and viable for people to go into town,"" says Bernadette. For her husband the congestion charge ""is definitely a stick"" and he ""would like to see a carrot instead"".   Cambridge, he says, should ""create something that's a big carrot for people to use public transport and avoid paying congestion charges"". Another lesson from Gothenburg for Cambridge is how persistently unpopular the charge there has been. Even in Greta Thunberg's home country and in a city with a developed public transport network, including trams that glide through suburbs and into the centre, the majority has never supported the congestion charge here.  A referendum in 2014 - held the year after it was introduced - saw 57% oppose it.  In a twist almost worthy of Scandinavian drama, officials said the referendum was only advisory and kept the charge in place.  A public opinion tracker from Gothenburg University's SOM Institutet has consistently shown it has a negative approval rating. Ten years ago, Theo Papaioannou, now 47, was instrumental in pressuring the authorities to hold the referendum. He co-founded and led the Vägvalet political party, established to fight the charge. ""It has become like an unlimited resource of income for the municipality without any consequences if something goes wrong,"" he says, standing within sight of the Town Hall, where he held a seat on the city council for eight years. ""Everything we said 10 years ago, 15 years ago is happening right now."" He describes the charge as an ""unfair expense"" that drivers ""are really angry about"". ""I think they see it as an extra expense that they don't really need to be paying to be frank,"" he says. ""It is like a penalty for going back and forward to your job or taking your kids to school."" His main concern, he says, is about the ""democratic process - that they didn't do the democratic process much better and informed the citizens"" about the charge. Addressing those in Cambridge who want to stop the congestion charge plans, he says: ""I would write to tell them that… if you want to get to the politician's ear, you need to start really quickly now and start building opinion about it.  ""It's really difficult when you're from the outside [trying to get] to the inside, but they need to try hard to get the attention of the politicians. ""You need to protest really hard when you're outside the political system."" But not everyone you meet in the city is anti-congestion charge. Erica Abrahamsson, 21, says some people avoid driving because of the charge.  ""But actually I think that's pretty good,"" she says, ""because we have really good trams and buses"". ""Usually I only take the bus. Gothenburg is pretty big, but the buses go everywhere. ""I feel like they need to get the money somewhere so I think that's a pretty good way to get it. I think it's better to charge here where we have a better alternative."" Madelen Karlson, 47, agrees. I think it's OK. It's a good thing that we can help,"" she says. Gothenburg's ""congestion tax"" is part of the West Sweden Agreement, a pact agreed in 2009 between the national government and regional authorities.  It provided SEK 34bn (£2.66bn) for infrastructure projects, including a new bridge over the Göta älv river and a rail tunnel under the city, known as the West Link. The congestion charge must deliver some SEK 14bn (£1.1bn) of the funds. As well as raising money, city authorities say since it began in 2013, traffic flow has decreased by between 10% and 15%. Public transport use increased 8% in the first year and has been rising ever since. Viktor Hultgren, 38, oversees the congestion charge for the city authorities.  He says a 10% reduction in traffic ""maybe… doesn't sound much, but it has a clear impact on the congestion"". He admits the city would not have the charge if it didn't bring money to the city.  ""I think that was the main objective in constructing these charges,"" he says. But his advice to Cambridge is to focus ""less on the money and more on the congestion"".  ""I think you should try to see where do you have congestion problems and make a congestion charge system that tackles these problems more than [raising] revenue,"" he says. ""I think the public acceptance would be higher if you could see more clearly what impact the charge has on congestion.  ""I think some people see the congestion charge as a way to make money, they don't see the benefits of this system. It has clear benefits and it is hard to see for some people."" For Thomas Sterner, an environmental economist at the University of Gothenburg, it is ""surprising and pioneering"" for a ""relatively small city like Cambridge"" to be considering a congestion charge ""before some of the bigger ones like Manchester or Liverpool"" have established their own. ""I think it needs to be carefully thought through and combined with policies that really make it easier to go bike and flexible public transport,"" he says. ""Economists have usually thought most about efficiency, that is also important, but fairness is typically the most important when it comes to public acceptance. Asked what his postcard Cambridge, where he spent a sabbatical in the 1980s, might include he ponders for a moment and says: ""I think I'd write a letter because this is fairly complicated.""

Why have there been no named winter storms this year?,"By February, the UK would normally have had around three storms given names by the Met Office - just like Arwen, Barra and Callum. But so far this autumn and winter, there hasn't been a single one.  Weather patterns have been calmer across the Atlantic and towards northwest Europe. But why? There are a number of factors at play - and the forces behind this year's lack of storms were also instrumental in December's cold snap. In previous years, the first named storm has taken place by early December. And by the end of January, typically three storms would have formed, bringing impacts to the UK. Storms can bring a danger to life and cause millions of pounds worth of damage from strong winds, heavy rain and even significant snowfall. The busiest autumn/winter season was 2015-16, when a total of eight named storms had hit the UK by the start of February. During February 2022, three storms were named within a week. Dudley, Eunice and Franklin impacted hundreds of thousands of homes. The insurance payouts resulting from the three storms was close to £500 million, according to the Association of British Insurers. Storm Eunice was one of the worst storms to hit the UK in 30 years, with rare red warnings issued across south Wales and southern England.  Eunice was also responsible for a new England wind gust record of 122mph at The Needles on the Isle of Wight. Windstorms in the UK are usually caused by little wobbles in an active jet stream (a corridor of strong winds around 30-40,000ft up in our atmosphere) over the Atlantic directed towards northwest Europe. In some circumstances, the atmospheric conditions can create explosive cyclogenesis - or a weather bomb - just to the west of the UK, which can bring the most damaging winds. Naming storms was started by the Met Office and Ireland's Met Eireann in 2015, with the idea of being able to communicate the hazards and warnings associated with them. The Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) joined the initiative in 2019 so also contributes names to the list. Last year, our autumn - which, meteorologically speaking, runs from September to November - was the third warmest on record. While rainfall increased after the very dry spring and summer, it was only marginally above average. Into the start of winter, December was the first month in 18 where the average temperature went below average.   December's cold snap was due in part to what is known as a ""blocking weather pattern"". At the time, this pattern was over Western Europe, and preventing weather systems from reaching the UK. The UK's lack of named storms this season is likely to be due to the position of the Polar jet stream, a ribbon of strong winds high in the atmosphere that create and drive weather systems across the Atlantic to northwest Europe. Other parts of Europe have had more than their usual share of named storms. There have been eight in the southwest Europe naming group, which includes France, Spain, Portugal and Belgium. The UK's cold snap may be partially due to the fact that a naturally occurring climate pattern called La Nina - which means large-scale cooling in the Pacific - is in its third consecutive year. This is known as a ""triple-dip"". In this phase, UK winters tend to be colder and calmer at the start then switch to milder, wetter and windier weather toward the end of the season. Experts believe that rising global temperatures mean that La Nina and El Nino - the opposite of La Nina - events will become stronger by 2030.  The current forecast suggests high pressure will keep things relatively settled for most of the UK for the first week of February.   Any spells of wet and windy weather will be limited to northern areas of the UK.   Weather forecasts beyond a week ahead are generally uncertain but, into the middle of February, there are signs it could turn wetter and windier more widely. According to the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), the link between climate change and extra-tropical cyclones - the storms that normally affect northwest Europe - is currently unclear. They suggest that European windstorms have actually reduced in frequency over the last few decades. However, it is widely accepted that when we do get storms, climate change is likely to make them more extreme with higher rainfall totals and potentially greater impacts.

Log burner rule change in England could land users with £300 fines,"Households in England face fines of up to £300 and even criminal records if they flout new log burner rules. A tightening of emissions regulations has reduced the amount of smoke new stoves can emit per hour from 5g to 3g. It applies to homes in ""smoke control areas"" which cover most of England's towns and cities. Anyone found to be breaking the new measures could be issued with an on-the-spot fine. The rules are part of the government's new 25-year environmental plan. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the new measures were part of his government's drive to leave ""the environment in a better state than we found it"".  In recent years, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has cracked down on log burners and coal fires as, according to the government, they are the largest source of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) - small particles of air pollution which find their way into the body's lungs and blood. Around 1.5m homes use wood for fuel across the UK, however burning wood and coal in open fires and stoves makes up 38% of the UK's emissions of PM2.5. By comparison, 16% come from industrial combustion, 12% from road transport and 13% from the use of solvents and industrial processes. This means a wood-burning stove emits more particles per hour than a diesel lorry. As well as reducing the amount of PM2.5 wood burners are allowed to emit, Defra said it will enable local authorities to ""better enforce"" smoke control areas. They will be allowed to issue fines of up to £300 on household whose chimneys are emitting too much smoke, and even pursuing a criminal case if they do not comply. Under the 25-year plan, the government said it was tightening the rules rather than implementing a complete ban on burning fuels as some households use them to provide heating and for cooking.  But avoiding a ban are barbeques, fire pits or bonfires, as doing so would be ""disproportionate"", the government said. In a bid to try and cut particulate matter, last year the government banned the purchase of house coal and wet wood in England, two of the most polluting fuels, and urged the public to move to ""cleaner alternatives"".  As is already the case, householders can be fined up to £1,000 if they are found to be burning unauthorised fuels. A list of authorised fuels in each of the four nations of the UK can be found on the government's website. Client Earth, an NGO which has won pollution cases against the government, hit out at the 25-year plan, writing on Twitter that it was full of ""vague commitments"" and that environmental laws which are already in place are at risk due to Brexit.

Colorado River: US states fail to reach deal on cutting water use,"Seven US Western states that rely on the drought-stricken Colorado River have failed to reach an agreement on cutting water consumption. California, the largest user, did not join a water cut proposal put forward by six others by a federally requested 31 January deadline.  A two-decade drought has shrunk the river basin's water supply to historically low levels. The deadlock could prompt the US government to impose unilateral cuts. The Colorado River provides drinking water to more than 40 million people in the seven Western states - Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, Nevada, Arizona and California. But the drought in the region has reduced the river's flow significantly, and the states have consumed more water than is available, prompting the Interior Department to ask for restricting water use. The government had asked for a plan to reduce water use from the Colorado River basin by two to four million acre-feet, or one-third of the river's yearly average flow. Six of the states agreed on a plan that would bring it down  by two million acre-feet of water. Under that plan, California - the state with the largest water consumption rate - would need to cut more than one million acre-feet.  California had previously offered to reduce their consumption by just 400,000 acre-feet.  The Chair of the Colorado River Board of California told the Associated Press that the state ""remains focused on practical solutions that can be implemented now to protect volumes of water in storage without driving conflict and litigation"", and that it plans to submit its own plan.  The six other states submitted a proposal to the US Bureau of Reclamation that outlined ways to reduce water consumption.  The plan includes cutting water use from Lake Powell and Lake Mead to prevent the two critical reservoirs from reaching ""dead pool"" - i.e. when water in a reservoir drops so low that it cannot flow downstream.  ""We recognise that over the past twenty-plus years there is simply far less water flowing into the Colorado River system than the amount that leaves it, and that we have effectively run out of storage to deplete,"" the states said in their letter.  They added they will continue to work together with hopes of reaching consensus on ""how best to share the burden"" of protecting the water system.  Recent reports show that the Colorado River's water flows were down 20% in 2000 and by 2050 that number is estimated to more than double. A report in the journal Nature last year found 2000-2021 to be the driest 22-year period for southwestern North America in at least 1,200 years. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64485091
Fears bottle return scheme will not be ready by August deadline,"A leading trade body fears Scotland's deposit return scheme will not be ready to launch in August. The flagship initiative is designed to boost recycling via a 20p deposit on single-use drinks bottles and cans. But the Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) said its members, who must sign up by 1 March, had yet to see an operational blueprint. The Scottish government said it was working with the industry to deliver the scheme.  The chief executive of Circularity Scotland, the newly created company that will administer the initiative, told BBC Scotland it would be ready for its launch date of 16 August. But Ewan MacDonald-Russell, deputy head of the SRC, urged ministers to provide clarity for his members by the end of the month. Otherwise, he warned, consumers faced disruption, higher prices and reduced choice. Mr MacDonald-Russell said: ""Despite this enormous investment we are alarmed at the failure of government and the bodies it has approved to provide the key information needed for retailers to build a workable return system.  ""We are already beyond reasonable deadlines for this scheme to land well in August."" Following a meeting with Circular Economy Minister Lorna Slater on Tuesday, Mr MacDonald-Russell said the scheme was in ""last chance saloon"". He added: ""Unless the Scottish government and its partners can deliver a complete operational blueprint by the end of February, covering the key information retailers need to deliver the necessary infrastructure for DRS to succeed, we do not believe the scheme can launch successfully in mid-August."" He cautioned the potential fall-out would see consumers face ""a bewildering patchwork of approaches"" that would make the recycling process ""cumbersome"". Under the scheme every producer based in Scotland will have to add a 20p to every product that they make before it is sold anywhere in the country. It will then be charged to the retailer who will in turn bill the consumer. In order to recoup this money people need to take the empty bottles or cans to a reverse vending machine in a supermarket or designated return point. Dougal Sharp, founder of Innis & Gunn, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme there would be an additional 10p to 20p in admin costs per product associated with the scheme. Put together that could mean consumers face paying an additional £1.60 for a four-pack of the company's craft beer and £4 for a 10-pack.  Asked why he had described the scheme as ""extortion"" by the Scottish government, Mr Sharp said: ""Without signing up to the producer agreement we cannot sell anything in Scotland. It's that simple. ""But the big problem is that, contained within the producer agreement, is an obligation that will require Innis & Gunn, in the event that the scheme doesn't launch on 16 August this year, to pay significant sums of money into Circularity Scotland. ""So it is a case of 'if you don't sign up you can't trade' and 'if you do sign up and we don't launch you're on the hook for significant sums of money'."" Mr Sharp described the sliding scale of liabilities, which he said amounted to an unsecured loan, as ""eye watering"". For major companies he said this ranged from £50,000 to £1.5m a month. Mr Sharp said a ""huge amount of infrastructure"" was required ahead of the launch, from recycling centres to vehicles. He added: ""We are worried that the complexity of the scheme and the significant costs, both to producers and the end users, may jeopardise its success."" Justin Wingate, of On Trade Scotland magazine, told Good Morning Scotland the additional costs would filter down from the manufacturer to the consumer. He also said there was uncertainty in the hospitality sector as to why there was such a push forward from Circularity Scotland and the Scottish government to implement something that ""they have admitted themselves is not ready, and they are not ready for"". Mr Wingate added massive pressure was being put on brands, venues and administrators to deliver the scheme. The subject has been hotly debated on social media and a thread by Edinburgh-based craft brewer Theo Barnes warned smaller companies would face major cashflow problems. Scottish Conservative MSP Maurice Golden also said businesses hadn't been given answers ""to the most basic questions"". But David Harris, chief executive of Circularity Scotland, said the responsibility for operating the scheme rested with the producers. Asked about the current launch plan, he told Good Morning Scotland: ""The scheme will be ready."" Mr Harris described the initiative as ""a very major piece of environmental infrastructure"" which would have an impact on small and major producers as well as convenience stores and supermarkets. He added: ""We are not saying it will be perfect on day one but we are saying it will be up and running on time."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""We have committed to a pragmatic approach to implementation and to make the scheme more efficient and reduce costs.  ""Ministers and officials regularly meet with industry and will continue to do so as we work together to deliver this scheme."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-64484085
Innes FitzGerald: The teen turning down championships for the planet,"At 16 years old, athlete Innes FitzGerald is racing to help the planet.  The promising long-distance runner has turned down the chance to compete in the World Cross Country Championships. Her reasoning? The contest is in Australia, thousands of miles from her home in Devon. Innes says she cannot justify flying in a climate crisis. ""I had to make a move. I had to do something just to make sure people were aware of the problem,"" she says. ""I just thought I needed to do something,"" Innes tells BBC Newsbeat.  ""So when I had the opportunity to go to Australia, I was like, well, this is when I should say something."" She wrote a letter to British Athletics, first published in Athletics Weekly, where she wrote that travelling fills her ""with deep concern"". ""I would never be comfortable flying in the knowledge that people could be losing their livelihoods, homes and loved ones as a result,"" her letter says.  ""The least I can do is voice my solidarity with those suffering on the front line of climate breakdown.  ""Coming to a decision has not been easy, however, little compares to the grief I would feel taking the flight."" The response from British Athletics has been muted - the organisation declined to comment when approached by BBC Newsbeat and Innes says she only got a short response herself. However, others have praised Innes for showing climate leadership. Now the teenager hopes other athletes will follow her example. ""I hope that more athletes will begin to question their choices,"" says Innes.  ""Obviously, I don't expect everybody to behave in the way that I am but I think just doing little bits that they feel that they maybe can do. ""And more high-profile athletes, having such a big media platform, they should use that and talk about the issues."" Innes' choice highlights an issue in global competitive sport: is there a way it can be less travel-intensive? The Qatar World Cup had pledged to be the first carbon-neutral tournament but there were an estimated 500 flights every day in and out of the capital, Doha, which cast doubt on those ambitions.  And Nottingham Forest had to defend itself after flying to and from Blackpool - 20 minutes each way - for a match in January. For Innes, she appreciates sport is a global event but for now she's limiting herself to only competing in the UK and Europe. She ranked fourth in the U20 European Women's Cross Country Championships in December - she took the train to Italy to compete there - and she's conscious that her decisions could have an impact on her future career. ""It's really difficult because there's only so many competitions you can do with the same people in your home country,"" she says. ""Even now, I think I've let something go, I've maybe let my younger self down a bit. ""But I think the situation of the climate, it's an emergency - you have to act as if it's an emergency."" By David Lockwood, head of sustainability for BBC Sport A return economy flight from London to Sydney generates around 2,484 kg of CO2 per passenger, this is just from the burning of the fuel.  However, CO2 emitted at high altitude has an elevated impact - by a factor of around 2.7 - which would equate to 6,707 kg CO2.  There is no doubt that Innes' decision to not fly to Australia has already provoked debate and raised awareness of the relationship between sport and climate change. For athletes who train so hard and already give up so much for their sport, to forego a world championships is not to be under-estimated.  The bigger picture and, quite literally, the bigger issue, is the huge environmental and geographical footprint of sport. There is more sport now than ever before and increasingly it is globalised, driving emissions ever higher. The World Cross Country Championships is actually bucking that trend. It used to be an annual event, but since 2010 it's biennial, which effectively constitutes a halving of emissions. However, until there is real progress on global heating, maybe there is room for Innes' beloved sport and all others to follow her lead and make more sacrifices. That has to be led by the federations and governing bodies of all sports, it can't just be left to the young athletes to take a stand, show leadership and sacrifice.  ""The decisions I make now might not be the choices I choose to take in the future,"" says Innes.  She's open that she might decide to fly in the future, particularly if it becomes more environmentally friendly, but for now her heart tells her not to travel and she's listening to it.  ""It's gonna be tough,"" she says. ""But I'm willing to take on that challenge."" Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube. Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

Oxford: First buses in electric fleet set to arrive in September,"The first electric buses, set to form a fleet of 159, will be brought in on routes in Oxford from September. An area from Cumnor to the west and Wheatley to the east of the city, Kidlington to the north and Sandford to the south will be served by the fleet. Eight of the double-decker buses will be open-topped, to run on the city's sightseeing tour route. The £82.5m scheme is being paid for by the government, the council and bus firms. The government awarded Oxfordshire County Council £32.8m in March last year as part of its Zero Emission Bus Regional Areas (ZEBRA) scheme. The council has put in £6m and a further £43.7m has come from bus companies. Oxfordshire County Council said the scheme had been finalised after it signed contracts between the bus firms, manufacturers and its six traffic filters were given the go-ahead The new buses form part of the council's plans to get the county to net zero carbon emissions before 2050 to tackle climate change. The council said once the whole fleet is up and running most services across the Oxford Smartzone will be operated by battery electric buses.  Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Somerset student to take electric powerboat around UK,"A student is to attempt the fastest circumnavigation of the UK in an electric boat. Harry Besley, 16, from Somerset, said he wants to demonstrate the potential of electric engines in boats. He has now launched the Round Britain eRIB challenge for this summer to encourage the marine industry to find a more sustainable future.  He said: ""I was fed up with going out in boats and knowing that we are causing harm to the environment."" ""I knew that there would be a solution and I just need to find it,"" the Wellington School pupil added. ""I did some research and found that there were electric motors but I didn't know why people weren't using them instead of petrol engines.  ""I realised there wasn't the charging infrastructure and awareness for these motors to actually be a viable solution.  ""Hence the Round Britain eRIB Challenge which encourages locations around the UK install charging infrastructure and demonstrates the capabilities of electric boats."" Harry will be 17 when he attempts the record.  The route will start west along the south coast, north past Wales, stop at the Isle of Man and across to Northern Ireland, through the Caledonian Canal then south down the east of Scotland and England and back to the south coast.  There will more than 40 charging stops used on the journey. ""I'm now confident that by the summer we will have the boat and charging facilities for this challenge to be a reality,"" Harry said. ""I believe that we cause too much damage to the world, and I want to change that."" Harry said his passion for boats started at a young age and he is currently in the Navy Section of the Combined Cadet Force (CCF) at school.  He has his power boating level 2, sea survival, VHF, and lifeguarding certificates and plans to get his intermediate and advance powerboating by the challenge this summer.  ""Because I'm only 16, experience is limited, but still I have many hours on the water,"" he said.

GHGSat: Commercial satellite will see CO2 super-emitters,"The world's first commercial satellite dedicated to monitoring carbon dioxide from orbit will launch later this year. It will be put up by the Canadian company GHGSat, which already flies six spacecraft tracking methane emissions. The new platform will use the same shortwave infrared sensor but be tuned to CO2's specific light signature in the atmosphere.  The satellite will have a resolution at ground level of 25m, meaning it will be able to see major individual sources. ""We expect to see things like refineries, steel mills, aluminium smelters, cement plants, and, of course, thermal power stations,"" Stephane Germain, CEO at GHGSat, told BBC News. There are already a number national space agency missions tracking CO2. Nasa, for example, flies its Orbiting Carbon Observatories; Japan runs its GoSat mission; and China has TanSat. But these generally make large area maps of variations in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; they're not really set up to hone in on super-emitters at the scale of an individual industrial complex. To monitor CO2, the GHGSat sensor will have to work at a higher detection threshold than for Methane. CH4 is a much smaller component of the air - about 1.9 molecules in every million, versus 418 for carbon dioxide - making it much easier to see a methane spike above the normal background.  GHGSat-C10, as the new satellite will be known, will target a detection threshold of one megatonne per year. ""It's not as if we have to find the big CO2 emitters; we already know where they are,"" said Dr Germain. ""Unlike methane, which is fugitive - it shows up in places and at times you don't necessarily expect - we know where the large power plants are in the world; we know where the aluminium smelters are. So, this is more about being able to verify emissions."" GHGSat expects to sell its data to governments and financial services markets. The information will be used to check emissions estimates.  Modern plants will likely have deployed continuous emissions monitoring systems, perhaps in flue gas stacks. But even these operations may want occasional independent observations. And under the Paris Climate Accord, countries must compile CO2 inventories. The GHGSat data could help with international comparisons.  ""We'll see how we get on but we do have the aspiration of launching several more carbon dioxide satellites,"" Dr Germain said.   ""Ultimately, we'd like to get to at least monthly coverage of every major CO2 source in the world, and potentially even a weekly coverage of every source in the world.""

Coastal erosion: Climate group warns communities of cost,"Coastal homes worth an estimated £584m could be lost to the sea by 2100, a climate action group claimed. One Home compiled a map identifying 21 at-risk villages and hamlets stretching the length and breadth of England. It warned people living in coastal areas that protection and compensation may not be available at all. ""We urgently need to help seaside communities prepare for the damage that will come,"" One Home chief executive Angela Terry said. The group said 2,218 properties were vulnerable at locations on its interactive map - from Cornwall, along the south and east coast, and in Cumbria. It used data from the Environment Agency's National Coastal Erosion Risk Mapping (NCERM) dataset. Policies on whether to defend, retreat or abandon sections of coast were contained in shoreline management plans (SMPs), but although readily available to view, SMPs were not a guarantee of support, the One Home said. Ian Brennan, of Save Hemsby Coastline, revealed the prospect of storm damage was taking ""a huge toll on the mental health"" of local people.  He said more than 90 homes in the Norfolk village could be lost in the next 25 years if nothing was done. Ms Terry said: ""Sea levels are rising as global temperatures soar and so larger waves batter our coast during severe storms. ""These irreversible changes mean some cliff faces are crumbling fast. ""We can't turn the tide or build a wall around the entire coast so we urgently need to help seaside communities to prepare for the damage that will come. ""Shoreline management plans are publicly available documents but most people are unaware of their existence."" She said the map would explain SMPs in an ""easy-to-digest way"" as homeowners might be unaware their property was at risk or whether decisions were being made about them. ""Even where communities have been chosen to be saved, the money might not be there, giving people false hope that their home will be protected long term,"" she said. ""Owners might be asked to pay to demolish their homes while still paying their mortgage."" More than a third of England's coastline has a designation of ""no active intervention"", One Home said, meaning that nothing more would be done to defend against erosion. An Environment Agency spokesman said: ""We know the devastating impact that flooding and coastal change can have, which is why improving the resilience of people and communities is our top priority. ""From 2015 to 2021, we invested £1.2bn to better protect around 200,000 homes from coastal erosion and sea flooding. ""However, climate change means that our coast is changing at an accelerated rate, meaning in some places we and coastal authorities will need to help local communities adapt and transition away from the current coastline.""

Green projects are boosting UK growth - CBI report,"The transition to a greener economy is worth £71bn and has brought jobs and investment to parts of the UK experiencing industrial decline.  Those are the key findings of a new report written by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). The drive to reach net zero emissions involves more than 20,000 businesses, it calculates.  Some 840,000 jobs are linked to sectors ranging from renewable energy to waste management, it adds. Titled Mapping The Net Zero Economy, the report looked at the parts of the UK that have benefited most from policies aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions.  Scotland and English regions, such as Tyneside, Teeside, Merseyside and the Humber, had all done better than average, with the green economy being stronger and contributing more to growth than in London and the South East.  Green jobs also pay significantly more, the report says, with the average wage (£42,600) significantly above the national average (£33,400).  ""The net zero economy is addressing levelling up and the UK's productivity problem,"" says Peter Chalkley, the director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) who commissioned the research. ""But if the UK doesn't build on the good work that has already been done, we will lose out and lose jobs.""  The UK has long been seen as a leader in green technology, in particular offshore wind, but this position is at risk.  ""Other places (in the world) are really setting out their stalls for how they're going to capture that investment,"" says Tom Thackeray from the CBI who carried out the analysis, adding that there is now a ""global competition"" for green funding.  The passing last year of landmark legislation in the United States called the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has, analysts say, changed the global dynamic for green investment. The Bill puts aside $369bn (£297bn) for action related to tackling climate change and many companies now see America as the best destination for their money.  ""There's an excitement [about the US since the IRA], so the challenge for us is to reignite the excitement back in the UK,"" says Chris Stark, the chief executive of the Climate Change Committee, a public body that advises the UK government on its green policies. The view that the UK is losing momentum was also in Tory MP Chris Skidmore's Mission Zero report last month in which he said the UK was falling behind in the net zero race. Restrictive planning regulations for onshore wind and solar, and a lack of consistency in policy were among many issues Mr Skidmore cited as holding back investment from the private sector. ""We need to really speed up planning and consent for renewables and for network connections and for vehicle charging,"" says Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of trade association Energy UK.  ""It takes 12 years to build a wind farm in this country, when it should take one."" Responding to the report and the criticism of policy, a government spokesman said the UK was leading the world on tackling climate change. ""Our plans will support up to 480,000 jobs by 2030,"" they said. ""We are driving an unprecedented £100bn of private sector investment by 2030, backed by around £30bn in funding from the government since March 2021 to achieve our aims.""

Biden restores protections to Alaska's Tongass National Forest,"Joel Jackson, the president of the Organized Village of Kake, a tribal community, has lived within the Tongass National Forest in Alaska his entire life. His community relies on the land for hunting deer and fishing salmon that swim in streams kept cold by the old-growth forest.  But the 66-year-old worried about damage to that land - the largest national forest in the US - after former President Donald Trump rescinded a measure blocking logging and road-building on nine million acres of land in the Tongass in 2020.  ""The forest is key to our survival as a people, to our way of life … for thousands of years,"" Mr Jackson said.  Last week marked a long-awaited victory for Mr Jackson and other tribes and environmental groups who petitioned the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to reinstate the protections for the forest.  The agency announced last Wednesday it would once again ban logging and the construction of roads for cutting timber in over half of the Tongass. The decision follows a years-long conflict between Alaskan Republican officials - who have argued the rule has slowed economic development and that renewing it will hamper efforts to connect remote communities by road, among other concerns - and conservationists, indigenous groups and others who say the measure is key to protecting the environment.  Spanning nearly 17 million acres - an area slightly larger than the state of West Virginia - the Tongass stores 44% of all the carbon dioxide contained in national forests across the country, according to the Alaska Conservation Foundation.  One of the world's largest intact temperate rainforests, it is home to 800-year-old cedar, hemlock and Sitka spruce trees that help provide habitats for over 400 species of land and marine wildlife.  Environmental experts view protecting the forest as key to conserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change.  The decision to reinstate a rule blocking logging and road-building in the Tongass reflects the voices of Tribal Nations and the people of Southeast Alaska, while taking into account the importance of fishing and tourism to the region's economy, US Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a recent statement.  The protections - known as a ""roadless rule"" regulation - were first introduced by former President Bill Clinton's administration in 2001 to shield certain designated areas in US national forests from logging.  In 2020, after lobbying from Alaskan state officials, Mr Trump stripped the protections for the Tongass.  In a statement last week, Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, argued the Biden Administration's decision to reinstate protections turned ""the Tongass into a political football"", and would hinder local economic development. Her comments were echoed by her senate colleague Dan Sullivan, who pledged in a statement to ""fight this decision with everything in my power"", while Governor Mike Dunleavy called the USDA's move a ""huge loss for Alaskans"". But several local businesses and organisations said they disagreed.  Gordon Chew, a co-owner of Tenakee Logging Company, a small family-owned business in the area, said lumber jobs have declined in the Tongass National Forest over the past three decades. But he said this is because of factors such as rising fuel prices for transporting timber from an isolated Alaska and not due to the roadless rule.  ""If you believe in global warming, see the value of sequestering carbon, and you like the fishing industry and support tourism, these are all things that the roadless rule enhances,"" he said. The roadless rule was always ""contentious with Alaska politicians, but not so contentious with the public"", said Meredith Trainor, the executive director of the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council.  She argued it is ""really important to have the rule in place to have another impediment to a resurgence of logging in these intact forest areas"".  While Mr Jackson celebrated the rule change, he said he would not feel relieved until such protections are made permanent, a move he said could require congressional approval.  That could be his next battle, he said. ""I describe walking into the forest as walking into one of the most beautiful cathedrals you'll ever find in the world,"" he said. ""I don't want to have my grandchildren, their grandchildren, to have to fight for that too."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64428423
Nigeria floods: Songs and testimonies from a drowning world,"Communities hit by Nigeria's worst recorded floods are at the centre of an exhibition by photographer Gideon Mendel. He took portraits of people standing amid their drowned homes in the southern state of Bayelsa: In late November last year I travelled to Nigeria, more than a month after the floodwater had arrived and I found many houses were still inundated.  With the water slowly receding, my subjects were able to take me to their homes, often travelling by canoe.  ""This is the third time I have experienced a flood, but this is by far the worst,"" said Gift Ikuru (pictured above) from Ogbia municipality. ""All of my belongings are destroyed. There is no shelter for us, so we have been sleeping on the roadside."" I was repeatedly moved by the welcome I received in this community - from people dealing with such difficult circumstances. So many people wanted to have their experience documented that I often had a queue of people waiting to be photographed.  My subjects embraced this moment of witnessing, facing the camera with such dignity, like Shiphrah Timbiri Otuoke (above). She broke into spontaneous song as she stood outside her home, expressing sorrow but also a resilience shown by so many in Ogbia where many own small plots of land to grow crops. ""On our farm the water was above our heads so we had to take the risk of diving to harvest our cassava,"" she said. ""It brought so much destruction and hunger to our community. I am a sociology student and the flood was a disaster to me academically. I lost so many learning hours. My textbooks, handouts and notebooks are all damaged. I don't know where to start from now because I support myself with farming as a student."" The residents living on the lower level of Dorcas Apartments, accommodation for university students, have been all flooded. ""None of us have had any assistance in this terrible situation,"" said Joy Christian, whose husband is a caretaker of the building. ""We have seen huge rains this year, more than ever, but we know that this flood came from a dam being opened in Cameroon,"" said Eruabai Ase Otuaba (above). ""We thought the 2012 floods were the worst but the level is much higher this time. There is nowhere to sleep and the water came with sickness. With so many mosquitoes malaria is here. ""I am living with my family on the top level of the incomplete building. We have to use this contaminated water for washing and drinking."" Ms Otuaba said the displaced families had received no help from the government. ""The floodwater destroyed our store of food supplies from our family farm so we have nothing to feed on. The foundation of our house is also damaged. We do not know if it still will be standing after having so much water inside. ""But in our community we support each other. When there is food we share it. I have a degree in business studies, but I am not employed at present. I work on our family farm."" ""We were told that a flood is coming but we did not prepare for something of this magnitude, particularly because in this community flooding is rare,"" said farmer Prince Ogiasa Lume Otuoke (above). ""The flood came suddenly. There was no time for preparation as the water was overflowing with extreme force. I did not have the chance to dive into the water and save my crops.  ""Our main crop here is plantain, and for the planting we need the suckers. But they will have all rotted away under the floodwater."" According to the UN's disaster relief agency (Ocha), the flooding in Nigeria affected more than three million people. More than 600 people lost their lives and another 1.5 million people were forced to flee their homes. It extensively damaged houses, farms and basic infrastructure and decimated livelihoods across the country. ""The damage to staple foods such as cassava, rice, and plantain, among other crops, risks aggravating the already alarming food and nutrition crisis across Nigeria,"" said Ocha's Matthias Schmale. ""The experience was not easy. We have been moving from one place to another for shelter. We are now living in the upstairs of an incomplete building,"" said Iruaro Robert Otuaba, a school student (above right). ""We lost our personal belongings but I was most upset to see all my children's schoolbooks in the water,"" said his mother Edigiraru Donald (above left). ""All the crops from our farm are destroyed. We are seriously suffering now because I can't do any business to survive."" This is the outside of a church in Ogbia, showing how slow it was taking for the waters to recede. ""I remember the flood when 2012 when I was a boy, but that was not nearly as bad as this. Nobody in our community expected it to be this huge,"" said Mr Otuaba. For farmer Orubo Oro Tombia (above), from neighbouring Yenagoa municipality, the worst aspect has been the loss of cassava stems: ""It is a disaster to me in so many ways and the cause of so much stress. ""The farmland is submerged so all the stems are dead. That means there will be no crop in the coming year."" ""We know that many things caused this flood. A dam over the border in Cameroon released water, and our government has failed to prepare for this by building a dam to curtail it,"" she said. ""I also believe that climate change caused the unusual rains and the overflow of the dam. I have a canoe, so at least I am able to move around and return to my home."" Fidelia Shedrack Igbogene (above), also in Yenagoa, said her family were the only ones left on her street as they had an upper floor: ""Where we are here there is no comfort because the building is unfinished. Mosquitos feast on us. The situation is terrible and bad.  ""I make a living farming fish and we had two fishponds. They were washed away and I have lost all my fish."" ""I am a university student. Many of my academic books are damaged, and how can I study when I am living like this?"" said Winner Odums (above) in Ogbia. ""It's hard for my family to survive with food prices so high and all of our farm produce destroyed. With all the water still here it makes life unbearable."" Many people have been struggling to find refuge - this is Dorcas Apartments where only the upper levels were accessible. ""Someone gave us his place to stay but now he has just asked us to leave so we are now staying by the roadside,"" said Aruaman Ase in Ogbia. ""I work in a student building and most of their belongings under my watch as the apartment caretaker are gone, submerged under floodwaters,"" said Alawei Christian (above). ""This is my fourth experience of flooding, but it is much worse this time, the biggest of all of them. It has really affected my family. We have lost so much, including 25 chickens."" ""There has been some help offered, but not nearly enough,"" said Mr Christian. ""Imagine a bag of rice and beans for hundreds of people in the community. We received just a single cup measure of rice and beans."" Farmer Janet Eke Otuoke is sleeping at her brother's home in Ogbia: ""We are seven people in that small room with our children, living and managing together. ""I also lost all my cassava stems, so for us to plant next year it means we would need to buy them. But each stem goes for more than a 1,000 naira [$2.20, £1.75], which is far beyond our means.  ""My appeal to government is that they should help us to continue farming and also help with the properties that have been so damaged."" Interviews by Tife Owalabi and Stanley Boroh.

Somerset Levels: Ending thousands of years of peat extraction,"Environmental campaigners have welcomed news that companies could be paid to stop the extraction of peat. Somerset County Council and the government are discussing how to fund the move. Sales of peat to amateur gardeners will be banned in England from next year but it can still be mined under licence. Sian Russell, from Somerset Wildlife Trust, said ""peat is an invaluable resource"" and its extraction needs to ""end as soon as possible"". The Somerset Levels have a 2,000-year history of peat excavation but before winning last year's county council election the Liberal Democrats pledged to end it. The council wants to pay compensation to companies who volunteer to end the practice. The wildlife trust said the Somerset Levels contain 60,000 hectares (231 sq miles) of peat land which stores almost 11 million tonnes of carbon. It is also a wildlife haven as the country's largest remaining wetland. The soggy plants in peat take in carbon dioxide during photosynthesis but because they stay wet rather than fully decompose they hold onto that CO2. If the peat is dug up the stored carbon is released. Mrs Russell said: ""Peat extraction will always be a part of Somerset's history and has shaped the landscape around us today but undisturbed peat is an invaluable resource when it comes to both carbon storage and nature. ""Peat extraction that continues to take place is under licences which were issued decades ago."" ""Every bucket of peat that's taken from the ground worsens the climate emergency as well as accelerating nature's decline, so ultimately we need peat extraction to end as soon as possible."" A mile away from the wildlife trust's Westhay National Nature Reserve - a patchwork of bird hides and walkways crossing former peat works - is Godwins, which produces three million bags of compost a year. They are still digging up small amounts of peat from the levels while looking to futureproof their business, investing in new equipment and offering peat-free compost. Ben Malin, the sixth-generation managing director of the company, said they would eventually stop extracting peat. ""Peat has traditionally been very, very important but we've worked really hard over the last 20-odd years to reduce the amount of peat we use,"" he said. ""We're now down to about 30% peat so it's less important than it was - so we're preparing for a peat-free future, in line with government legislation."" ""We intend to be here in the long term as a business,"" added Mr Malin. DEFRA's ban applies to peat in products designed for everyday gardeners, professional growers will initially be exempt but a ban is planned for that industry too. Hestercombe gardens, near Taunton, are also moving towards a peat-free future - food waste from the kitchens and shredded paper from the office are mixed with garden waste to make their own compost. Head gardener Claire Greensdale said: ""The only place we struggle really is the bedding plants on the Victorian terrace. They're grown for us by professionals who are reluctant to change and will probably end their careers as peat phases out."" She says plants can grow as well without peat being used. ""We used to grow stuff at home without peat, it's not been that long we've used peat at home, so definitely you can grow whatever you want in a good soil,"" she said. A Defra spokesperson said peat lands are not only an ""iconic"" part of the UK landscape, they are the UK's largest stores of carbon. ""They also supply over a quarter of the UK's drinking water, decrease flood risk and provide food and shelter for rare wildlife,"" they said. ""However, when peat is extracted or becomes degraded it can release carbon dioxide contributing to climate change."" The spokesperson said the government has stopped granting licences for peat extraction on new or existing sites. ""We are continuing to explore how best we can support Mineral Planning Authorities, such as Somerset County Council, when opportunities to voluntarily bring an end to extraction are identified,"" they said. A spokesperson for Somerset County Council said it was ""keen"" to work with operators who want to voluntarily end peat extraction. ""We don't have figures for extraction rates or amounts removed in recent years but the number of operational sites is certainly reducing,"" the spokesperson added. ""All licenses are due to expire by the end of 2042, however it is anticipated most, if not all, will be complete in advance of this."" Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Warning climate change impacting on avalanche risk,"Avalanche forecasters say they are seeing likely impacts of climate change high in Scotland's mountains. The Scottish Avalanche Information Service said conditions were changing more rapidly and avalanches occurring in tighter spaces of time. It said named storms - such as 2021's Storm Barra - brought short, significant periods of ""proper winter"", raising the avalanche risk. The storms have often been followed by rising temperatures and snow loss. But SAIS warned that even in those ""leaner"" times when there was less snow potential hazards remained, often higher up towards the top of a coire, gully or mountain summit. Coordinator Mark Diggins said: ""In Scotland it has always been a harsh climate in winter, and things can happen pretty quickly. ""That is something we are continually trying to pass on to folk coming out into the hills and who might not appreciate they are pretty much entering a sub arctic landscape."" But he added: ""I would say what we are experiencing now is really rapid changes from one extreme to the other, both in terms of temperature and wind speed, and in the snow amounts. ""For us putting out forecasts, which are offered for a 24-hour period, the hazard could be considerable when we put it out and then the next day it has all been transformed and its a lesser hazard."" Rapid changes in conditions high in Scotland's mountains have been in evidence over the past few weeks. Days of snowfall were followed by higher temperatures and significant snow loss over the weekend. The potential avalanche hazard across the six mountain areas SAIS monitor went from ""considerable"" to ""low"" almost overnight. Forecasters in Torridon reported burns and rivers at levels usually seen following heavy rain, but this time swollen by snow melt. SAIS Lochaber said temperatures rose rapidly in the early hours of Saturday, while the service's Northern Cairngorms team, with tongue in cheek, described conditions as ""tropical"" on Monday. The various teams have since reported falling temperatures again.  Mr Diggins said Met Office data showed the January/February temperature on the summit of Cairn Gorm, one of Scotland's most popular mountains, had on average been two degrees higher over the last 30 years than it had been during the previous 30 years. He said another likely sign of climate change was that the snow line, the border between snow-covered and snow-free ground, appeared to be creeping higher up mountains. SAIS' teams of forecasters use internationally-recognised criteria to assess avalanche risk on mountain slopes. Most of the work is done out in the hills and part of the job involves digging pits down into extensive areas of snow cover, known as the snowpack, to find weaknesses in layers of snow which could result in an avalanche. SAIS teams have a very good idea of what is going on in the mountains because they have detailed forecasts and information from past field observations.  Mr Diggins said it had previously been possible for visitors to the hills to identify ""cues"" - signs of potential risks - soon after setting out. But he said: ""What we are seeing generally speaking is the snow line, that was quiet low in the past, is now much higher so we are not seeing those cues that we generally got to start thinking about any avalanche hazard."" Almost 90 avalanches have been recorded so far this season, and 162 last winter. Over the last 13 winters, the highest number of avalanches recorded by SAIS was 350 in 2013-14 while the lowest was 90 in 2016-17. SAIS provides daily avalanche hazard forecasts from mid-December to mid-April for six areas - Lochaber, Glen Coe, Northern Cairngorms, Southern Cairngorms, Creag Meagaidh and Torridon. The areas include Britain's highest mountains, including Ben Nevis, Ben Macdui and Braeriach, and popular summits such as Cairn Gorm, Liathach and Buachaille Etive Mòr. The service was started by Hamish MacInnes, a legendary Scottish mountaineer dubbed the Fox of Glencoe. It has been run its present format since the 1980s. SAIS provides daily avalanche hazard forecasts on its website and an app. It uses colours to indicate of the level of avalanche probability, with green for low and going up to black when the risk is deemed to be very high. There is also a ""rose"", a chart showing the distribution and altitude of potential avalanche hazards, and a set of symbols to help explain the cause of the problem. Mr Diggins said it was important people delved into the fine detail of the reports to understand the potential avalanche hazard before setting out on trips into the mountains. Dr Mike Spencer, who works on financial and climate challenges with the Smart Data Foundry at the University of Edinburgh, said research suggested Scottish winters were changing. He said the Snow Survey of Great Britain, a dataset collected from the 1940s until the mid 2000s, had recorded that the number of days with snow lying had dwindled since the 1990s. Dr Spencer said: ""Since the snow survey ended there have been a handful of very snowy winters, 2009/10 and 2017/18, but many winters the snow cover has been less consistent than in the past."" He said it was expected the future would see warmer average temperatures and more changeable weather because of climate change. Dr Spencer added: ""This changeable weather is likely to mean periods of intense precipitation alternating with drought conditions - something we're already seeing more frequently. ""In the mountains rising temperatures are likely to mean less days of precipitation falling as snow, and when it does the duration it lies for will be reduced."" He said climate models suggested Scotland was still likely to see winters with very heavy snowfall, but over time this was expected to become a less frequent occurrence due to warming average temperatures.

Government green heating scheme off to slow start,"A major new grant scheme to replace gas boilers in England and Wales has got off to a slow start, government figures released on Thursday show. Under The Boiler Upgrade Scheme households can apply for vouchers to help them switch to a heat pump. The government aims to give out 30,000 vouchers annually but only managed 9,888 between the scheme's launch in May and the end of the year. The government told the BBC it was on track to meet its targets. Switching to heat pumps helps lower heating emissions and therefore will help the UK meet its climate targets. Since May last year households across England and Wales have been able to access a £5,000 grant to replace their boiler with a more environmentally-friendly heating system. The government set aside £450m for this scheme, and said it would fund 90,000 pumps over three years. Based on new figures released on Thursday, at the current rate, by March 2025 when the scheme is due to end only 42,000 vouchers would be issued. A spokesperson for the UK's Climate Change Committee, the government's advisory group on climate, told the BBC that although the number of retrofits is broadly in line with their models ""the government could increase uptake of Boiler Upgrade Scheme, specifically by raising public awareness and providing further funding"".  A government spokesperson told the BBC that it has recently launched a targeted marketing campaign to increase public awareness in the scheme.  Jess Ralston, head of energy at policy think-tank Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, told the BBC she was not surprised by the scheme's slow start: ""In terms of government schemes they all have teething issues in the first year."" Industry experts say the delay in getting the scheme online deterred installers from offering their services. The scheme was set up by the government to reduce the climate impact of heating UK homes - which produces 14% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions.  Heat pumps run on electricity rather than gas and are three times more efficient, so also offer households an opportunity to save money.  The scheme had already come under criticism for providing funding for just 90,000 vouchers when the government is targeting 600,000 installations by 2028.  But it said that the scheme was about creating a demand for heat pumps to allow the market to grow. Ms Ralston said that the scheme will certainly help the industry get ready but there ""is still a massive scale of difference, and in other countries we are seeing long-term policy plans. Three years isn't very long and people need the confidence to invest"". Currently the UK is one of the poorest performing countries for heat pump installation in Europe. In 2020, nearly 400,000 heat pumps were installed in France compared to the UK's 37,000, according to energy analysts. The application and issuing of vouchers also differs significantly across the regions of England and Wales. The top four of the five regions for heat pump installations in this scheme were in the south of England. Voucher deployment is dependent upon households applying for the scheme but the cost of living crisis may be putting some people off as the voucher only covers between 75% and 50% of the cost, said Ms Ralston.

Is UK being left behind in global fight for investment?,"When the US Congress passed Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act last summer, the bill seemed built on good intentions. Designed to boost America's green economy and tackle climate change, the act included billions of dollars of subsidies for the purchase of electric cars and other eco-friendly products. But a provision that those subsidies will only be available to consumers who buy American-made products has enraged many European nations. They see it as a thinly-disguised attempt to grab a share of Europe's high tech manufacturing sector, including Britain's, by luring European companies to relocate factories to the US. Welcome to the global race for dominance of green technology, where the future of the planet and the global economy are entwined in a potentially risky geopolitical game.  It is the US and the EU at loggerheads, but some East Asian nations are registering their displeasure too, and some in British business are wondering exactly where the UK stands in this growing row. While most countries subsidise green technology, it was Joe Biden's specific targeting of funds solely for North American-made cars that spooked many allies. People who buy passenger vehicles assembled in America now qualify for a tax credit of up to $7,500 (£6,000) .  Many European firms were on the list of investors in US car production read out by Joe Biden when he unveiled the Inflation Reduction Act. But it isn't just cars that will be affected.  Svein Tore Holsether, the boss of Norwegian fertiliser manufacturer Yara, told me: ""The US is putting in place a system that provides rewards for sequestering carbon and also for switching to green production at a level that really incentivises and drives investment. ""Questions are being asked in many [European] companies right now. Where are the incentives? Businesses are shutting down. New investments are being made in the US."" Meanwhile, the French finance minister Bruno Le Maire told me: ""We shouldn't underestimate the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act... [French President Emmanuel] Macron has been very clear... First of all, we want to get some concessions from the US administration. We are friends and allies so we want to get some exemptions.""  Mr Le Maire said he would go to Washington with his German counterpart soon to raise these concerns. In fact, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has already held direct discussions with top US senators and members of Congress over the Inflation Reduction Act.  Mr Le Maire also wouldn't rule out the idea of Europe launching its own ""Buy European"" subsidies for green tech in response.  ""Everyone understands that at some point in strategic sectors like green industry, there is a need to invest more and to have a kind of European buyback."" Leo Varadkar, leader of Ireland, traditionally the closest US ally in Europe, was more direct. He said his country was ""not happy"" about the Inflation Reduction Act.  ""There will have to be a response from the European Union and that will almost certainly involve providing state aid and subsidies to European businesses. The difficulty with that is you end up in a subsidy war, a subsidy competition,"" he said.  What is clear is that the EU is about to respond to the massive American plan, despite concerns among members about sparking a trade war. And the White House is aware of the issues, having set up a US-EU task force to consider them.  Where the UK stands in all of this is less certain.  While the BBC understands that both the Business and Trade Secretaries have raised their concerns with their US counterparts, their precise demands are unclear. The Business Secretary Grant Shapps says the UK doesn't need a US-style package of green incentives, because the UK is already ""ahead of the game"". ""Actually we've done our investment to get renewable energy, which is what the US Inflation Reduction Act is all about. We've done it a decade ago,"" he told me.  ""Which is why we don't just have the world's largest offshore windfarm, we've got the second largest and the third, the fourth and we've got another coming along that's bigger still.""  He's also confident the UK won't be overlooked in what may end up being an EU-US carve-up on this issue.   He said he had also spoken to his opposite number in the Biden ministry, Climate Envoy John Kerry, and Mr Shapps says much of what the US is doing is welcome. ""The bits that actually could affect us, the protectionist bit, they're the edges that need to come off [this new bill]."" The current line from leaders that have discussed the Inflation Reduction Act with their US counterparts is that this was all an accident, and in drafting this legislation the US ""just forgot"" about Europe and committed an economic ""half aggression"".  The reassurance has been that this was all aimed at China, not Europe. But there is no doubt that the heads of major European manufacturers are being turned. And while the needs of net zero do tend towards more of Europe's manufacturing being done in Europe, and likewise for North America, there is a red line that shouldn't be crossed, according to one European leader.  If European export production, investment and jobs start to migrate over the Atlantic, things could get sticky, they told me.  There's also concern this won't end with ""green technologies"". The supply chain bottlenecks sparked by the pandemic have made countries rethink their reliance on East Asia, and not just China, for manufactured goods.  Spades are going into the ground across the EU and the US on new facilities for the production of microchips, with major western tech manufacturers attracting huge subsidies. Europe calls this ""strategic autonomy"", the Americans call it ""friend shoring"" or the restoring of supply chains to friendly nations. It signals the redirection of massive flows of investment away from their existing homes at a time when many industries are undergoing huge transformative change. This process could change the landscape of world manufacturing for a generation. Some in British industry fear an EU-US carve-up not just over electric cars, but microchips and other critical technologies. And it is clear that the ""globe"" which ""global Britain"" sought to engage after Brexit has changed significantly, raising quite fundamental strategic questions about Britain's future in the midst of it all.

Emma Thompson and Aisling Bea urge UK banks to stop financing fossil fuels,"Emma Thompson, Stephen Fry and Aisling Bea are among celebrities calling on the five of the UK's biggest High Street banks to stop financing new oil, gas and coal projects.  It follows criticism that HSBC, Barclays, Santander, NatWest and Lloyds are funding ""fossil fuel expansion"" despite making green pledges. Businesses and charities like Greenpeace also back the campaign.  HSBC and Barclays said they were helping their clients to cut emissions. The Make My Money Matter campaign points to research by environmental charity Rainforest Action Network, which claims that between 2016 and 2021, HSBC, Barclays, Santander, NatWest and Lloyds funnelled almost $368bn (£298bn) towards the fossil fuel industry.  It added that in the same time period, the lenders financed the 50 companies making the biggest investments in oil and gas projects to the tune of $141bn. It added that while HSBC and LLoyds had made ""welcome new announcements"" on stopping direct finance for new fossil fuel expansion since then, ""there is a long way to go"". ""HSBC was this month found to have provided $340m to a company opening a new coal mine in Germany,"" it said.   The campaign, which is also backed by actor Mark Rylance and musician Brian Eno, urges the public to sign an open letter asking the banks to stop directly financing projects that expand fossil fuel use, or end relationships with clients that do.   The campaign's founder, filmmaker Richard Curtis, said he wanted to put ""a fire under the banks"".  ""It's clear that new oil and gas fields are not only hugely damaging to the planet, but they're also wildly unpopular with the public,"" he added.  Almost one third of HSBC, Barclays, Santander, NatWest and Lloyds' customers surveyed by the campaign said that they would switch bank if they discovered that theirs was financing the expansion of fossil fuel projects.  Over 85% of customers at the five banks surveyed said they did not think that their bank was doing enough to tackle the climate crisis.  TV presenter Chris Packham CBE said that financial institutions had an ""enormous ethical and moral responsibility"" to start withdrawing funding from organisations that damaged the climate and biodiversity.  High Street banks have made steps to loosen their ties to environmentally damaging companies. Britain's biggest domestic bank, Lloyds, announced it would stop ""direct"" financing to develop new oil and gas fields in October. The BBC has also contacted Lloyds for comment.

"Electricity to be 100% renewable by 2035, say Welsh ministers","More heat pumps in homes and community energy projects are part of the Welsh government's target to meet 100% of its electricity needs from renewables in 12 years time.  The latest estimates show renewables cover 56% of our energy consumption but Climate Change Minister Julie James called the new target ""ambitious but credible"", even with energy demand set to soar with the move towards electric cars and away from gas boilers. It is considerable scaling up of ambition, as the previous target was to reach 70% by 2030. The consultation includes plans to increase the capacity of renewable energy but also to reduce the demand for it.  But there is no room for complacency, according to the leading think tank the Institute for Welsh Affairs (IWA). Auriol Miller from the IWA said ""there's nothing automatic"" about hitting these targets, and the government must focus on ""finding new and alternative sources of energy"", as well as reducing consumption through retrofitting homes. Speaking in the Senedd, the minister announced a consultation on the new targets, which ""propose a pathway for us to meet the equivalent of 100% of our annual electricity consumption for renewable electricity by 2035, and to continue to keep pace with consumption thereafter"". The plans include a target for at least 1.5 gigawatts (GW) of energy capacity to come from smaller-scale community-owned projects. And, subject to strengthened support from the UK government and reductions in cost, the minister wants 5.5GW of energy to be provided by heat pumps in the same time-frame.  The latest estimates, published in 2020, show Wales already meets 56% of it electricity needs from renewable sources like wind, sun and water, but to reach 100% in just over a decade many barriers will need to be overcome.  So how will they do it? Energy infrastructure, like the grid and connecting the energy generated by windfarms in the sea to that grid, are some of the huge challenges.  As part of Tuesday's announcement, the minister said the Welsh government will provide £1m of funding to explore the potential of offshore wind in the Celtic Sea.  The money will be match-funded by Associated British Ports (ABP) which says it will be used to ""kick-start the development of a major green energy hub at Port Talbot"".  Andrew Harston from ABP said the £2m ""is key to the construction of transformational infrastructure, which will enable the manufacturing, integration and assembly of floating offshore wind components at Port Talbot"". Julie James conceded that the Welsh government's investment of £1m was a drop in the ocean, considering the level of funding needed to deliver floating wind offshore in south west Wales.  But she said the investment signals to the industry Welsh ministers' commitment, and added ""this is not the end of our support"". Meanwhile, the UK government has acknowledged that a ""step-change is needed"" to boost grid capacity in Wales.  A group of MPs has published a report looking at the problems with the grid here and, in a response published on Tuesday, the UK government said it  will continue to work on ""strategic planning, regulatory approval, planning consents and streamlining connections across Great Britain, including Wales"". Planning procedures must be improved, according to industry representatives.  Manon Kynaston, deputy director of RenewableUK Cymru, a trade body that represents the industry, welcomed the revised target and agreed that it is ambitious but achievable.  However, she said there is a great deal of work to be done to not only reach the targets but to keep those benefits in Wales.  ""To be able to reach those targets we need a system that is diverse and flexible, that includes fixed off shore wind from the coast of north Wales but also the significant opportunity we have of floating offshore wind in the Celtic Sea.   ""We need to unlock some key barriers, mainly consenting and licensing, and also working closely with the UK government to ensure we have investment in our ports and infrastructure,"" she said. ""We really need anticipatory investment to make sure the grid is fit for purpose to take advantage of the opportunities."" Central to the Welsh government's vision is ensuring the benefits stay in local communities as much as possible, and the profits do not leave Wales to big multinational companies.  Ynni Ogwen is one example of a community project the minister would like to see more of.  It is a hydroelectric project on the Afon Ogwen near Bethesda in Gwynedd, which generates electricity and ploughs the profits back into the community. Recently the scheme gave £20,000 back to help ease the cost of living crisis in the area.  Meleri Davies, a founder member of Ynni Ogwen, said it is great that there are new targets but the Welsh government ""must ensure the projects are community based"".  ""We need more projects like this simply because of the economic, social and environmental impact of this scheme,"" she said. But Ms Davies said she would like the government to go further and ensure the energy they produce can be used locally. ""At the moment the energy we produce here is exported to the grid who pay us for it. ""If we could use that energy to power homes locally at a reduced tariff that would be tremendous.  ""That's the kind of aspiration we'd like the Welsh government to move towards."" Ms Davies also said that more funding is needed to make it easier for projects like Ynni Ogwen to get off the ground.  ""We need funding, last year there were only four community owned projects developed.  ""You need a lot of investment, a grant subsidy or support, to enable this kind of project to happen."" With consumption of electricity expected to rise in coming years, as we move towards electric vehicles and away from gas boilers, the pace of the rollout of renewable energy will need to increase if we are to have a chance of reaching the 100% target. Part of that ambition is to encourage more of us to install heat pumps, but that is ""not happening quick enough"", according to Auriol Miller.  She said it is important not to put too much responsibility on individuals.  She said: ""Welsh government [and the UK government] needs to be thinking about the investment for that to happen and then the deployment of that as well.""  ""So retrofitting homes is great, but it's not happening quick enough at the moment.""  It seems the urgency to act is not lost on the industry, which says it is poised to take advantage of the opportunities available but that it is up to the governments to do more to ensure projects move quicker.  ""We are in a climate emergency, the time to move is now,"" said Manon Kynaston.  And time is of the essence according to Auriol Miller. ""We know from the global climate change challenge that we've got ten years really to make a difference in terms of safeguarding the future of our planet.  ""That goes for us here in Wales too.""

Liz Truss: Ex-PM to join global campaign to put pressure on China,"Former Prime Minister Liz Truss is to join an international campaign to put pressure on China over its human rights record and economic coercion against smaller countries.  Ms Truss will address a conference of global politicians in Japan this month designed to coordinate the policies of democratic governments towards Beijing.  Since she resigned in October, Ms Truss has kept a low profile.  But recently her allies have formed a group to push her low-tax agenda. Members of the Conservative Growth Group include former ministers Simon Clarke and Ranil Jayawardena, who both served in Ms Truss's cabinet.  Ms Truss resigned after just 45 days in office, following the economic turmoil of her mini-budget.  In December the former prime minister met like-minded Republicans during a trip to Washington.  However, her speech to the conference in Japan will be her first public outing overseas since leaving office.  The conference is organised by the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, which seeks to coordinate international pressure on Beijing.   The cross-party group of politicians works on issues including upholding human rights and promoting trade fairness.  In her speech, Ms Truss is expected to focus on the threat to Taiwan.  She will also be joined by two other former prime ministers - Scott Morrison of Australia and Guy Verhofstadt of Belgium. Diplomats will watch closely to see if Ms Truss adopts a harder line than her former government, which still hopes to cooperate with China on climate change and trade.  In November, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the so-called ""golden era"" of relations with China was over and that the closer economic ties of the previous decade had been ""naïve"".  But he stressed ""we cannot simply ignore China's significance in world affairs - to global economic stability or issues like climate change"". Ms Truss's predecessor as prime minister, Boris Johnson, has also re-emerged on the global stage since leaving office.  Last month, he visited Kyiv, where he met President Volodymyr Zelensky and other Ukrainian ministers.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64509979
Chinese spy balloon: US tracks suspected surveillance device,"The US is tracking a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that has been spotted flying over sensitive sites in recent days. Defence officials said they were confident the ""high-altitude surveillance balloon"" belonged to China. It was most recently seen above the western state of Montana. The military decided against shooting it down in case debris falls. China warned against speculation and ""hype"" until the facts are verified. The object flew over Alaska's Aleutian Islands and through Canada before appearing over the city of Billings in Montana on Wednesday, US officials said. A senior defence official said the government prepared fighter jets, including F-22s, in case the White House ordered the object to be shot down. Canada said on Friday that it was monitoring ""a potential second incident"" involving a surveillance balloon, but did not say which country could be behind it. It said in the statement that it is working closely with the US to ""safeguard Canada's sensitive information from foreign intelligence threats"".   Top military leaders, including Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and General Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, met on Wednesday to assess the threat. Mr Austin was travelling in the Philippines at the time. Montana, a sparsely populated state, is home to one of only three nuclear missile silo fields in the country, at Malmstrom Air Force Base, and the official said the apparent spy craft was flying over sensitive sites to collect information. But the military leaders advised against taking ""kinetic action"" against the balloon because of the danger that falling debris might pose to people on the ground.  Officials refrained from giving information about the exact size of the balloon, but described it as ""sizeable"", with reports of pilots being able to see it, even from a distance. US media have reported another US official comparing it to the size of three buses.  The defence department, however, said there was no ""significantly enhanced threat"" of US intelligence being compromised, because American officials ""know exactly where this balloon is and exactly where it's passing over"". And there was also no threat to civilian aviation as the balloon was ""significantly"" above the altitude used by commercial airlines.  The statement added that the balloon is unlikely to give much more information than China can already collect using satellites. The US had raised the matter with Chinese officials in their embassy in Washington DC and in Beijing, officials added. China's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Beijing is currently attempting to verify the reports of the surveillance balloon, adding that ""until the facts are clear, making conjectures and hyping up the issue will not help to properly resolve it"". ""China is a responsible country and always abides strictly by international law. We have no intention of violating the territory or airspace of any sovereign country,"" she said. During Thursday's briefing at the Pentagon, officials declined to disclose the aircraft's current location and did not give information on where it was launched from.  They added that such surveillance balloons had been tracked in the past several years, but this one was ""appearing to hang out for a longer period of time this time around"". It confused social media users in Montana, with some posting images of a pale round object high in the sky. Others reported seeing US military planes in the area, apparently monitoring the object. Billings office worker Chase Doak told the Associated Press news agency that he noticed the ""big white circle in the sky"" and went home to get a better camera.  ""I thought maybe it was a legitimate UFO,"" he said. ""So I wanted to make sure I documented it and took as many photos as I could."" Chinese state media site the Global Times accused the US of aggravating tensions between China and the US by frequently creating a Cold War atmosphere. It is also being widely discussed on Chinese social media, with many amused at the reported use of balloons for surveillance. ""We have so many satellites, why would we need to use a balloon,"" wrote one user on Weibo. Senator Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, slammed China's alleged balloon. ""The level of espionage aimed at our country by Beijing has grown dramatically more intense & brazen over the last 5 years,"" he tweeted. Montana Governor Greg Gianforte, a Republican, said in a statement that he had been briefed on the ""deeply troubling"" situation. Speaking at an unrelated event in Washington DC on Thursday, CIA Director William Burns made no mention of the balloon, but called China the ""biggest geopolitical challenge"" currently facing the US. The alleged spy craft is likely to increase tensions ahead of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to China next week. It will be the first visit to the country by a Biden administration cabinet secretary. The top US diplomat will be in Beijing to hold talks on a wide range of issues, including security, Taiwan and Covid-19. He will also meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, the the Financial Times reported on Thursday. Balloons are one of oldest forms of surveillance technology. Compared to other air surveillance devices, they can be operated cheaply without personnel, while remaining airborne for long periods of time.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64507225
Why would China use a spy balloon when it has satellites?,"News of a suspected Chinese spy balloon floating over the US has left many wondering why Beijing would want to use a relatively unsophisticated tool for its surveillance of the US mainland. The capabilities of this particular balloon are unclear, but experts say it serves more as a ""signal"" than a security threat. It was spotted floating over the state of Montana, days before US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to China. The top US diplomat is expected to meet China's President Xi Jinping, making him the first in his role to do so. ""Beijing is probably trying to signal to Washington: 'While we want to improve ties, we are also ever ready for sustained competition, using any means necessary', without severely inflaming tensions. ""And what better tool for this than a seemingly innocuous balloon,"" independent air-power analyst He Yuan Ming told the BBC.  Balloons are one of the oldest forms of surveillance technology. The Japanese military used them to launch incendiary bombs in the US during World War Two. They were also widely used by the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. More recently, the US has reportedly been considering adding high-altitude inflatables into the Pentagon's surveillance network. Modern balloons typically hover between 24km-37km above the earth's surface (80,000ft-120,000ft). The US Department of Defence on Thursday said the balloon is ""significantly above where civilian air traffic is active"". It also said it had ""very high confidence"" that the balloon belongs to China. But China expert Benjamin Ho said Beijing had more sophisticated surveillance technology at its disposal.  ""They have other means to spy out American infrastructure, or whatever information they wanted to obtain. The balloon was to send a signal to the Americans, and also to see how the Americans would react,"" explained Dr Ho - coordinator of the China programme at Singapore's S Rajaratnam School of International Studies. It may even be the case that China wanted the US to detect the balloon.  ""It's possible that being spotted was the whole point. China might be using the balloon to demonstrate that it has a sophisticated technological capability to penetrate US airspace without risking a serious escalation. In this regard, a balloon is a pretty ideal choice,"" said Arthur Holland Michel from the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs. Nevertheless, the experts point out that balloons can be fitted with modern technology like spy cameras and radar sensors, and there are some advantages to using balloons for surveillance - chief of which is that it is less expensive and easier to deploy than drones or satellites.  The balloon's slower speed also allows it to loiter over and monitor the target area for longer periods. A satellite's movement, on the other hand, is restricted to its orbital pass. Although China has not admitted it launched the balloon, Mr Michel says it is unlikely anyone else could be responsible. ""The [US Department of Defence] would likely not say that it is a Chinese balloon unless they have a fairly high degree of certainty that that is what it is."" The balloon's anticipated flight path near certain missile bases suggests it is unlikely it has drifted off course, He Yuan Ming said. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64508086
Tunisia country profile,"Tunisia was once an important player in the Mediterranean, thanks to its location in the centre of North Africa, close to vital shipping routes.

Willie Kimani: Kenya ex-policeman sentenced to death for lawyer's murder,"A Kenyan court has sentenced to death a former policeman for the murder of a human rights lawyer and two others in a case which shocked the nation.   Two other policemen and a civilian were also sentenced to between 20 and 30 years for the murder of lawyer Willie Kimani, his client and a taxi driver in June 2016.  The four were found guilty of three counts including murder.  Death sentences for murder in Kenya are commuted to life in prison. However, the 2017 Supreme Court ruling gave judges discretion to decide if a death sentence can still be imposed.  An army officer behind an attempted coup in 1982 was the last person to be executed in Kenya. The murder of Kimani highlighted the many extrajudicial killings and disappearances that have been blamed on the Kenyan police.  Former police officer Fredrick Leliman, who was sentenced to death, and the other three convicts, can appeal against their conviction and sentencing within 14 days.  In her judgement on Friday, Judge Jessie Lessit, said evidence produced during the trial had shown that the murders were premeditated and the victims brutally tortured and killed.  ""No-one should experience what these three went through, especially from the same people mandated to protect them,"" said Benson Shamala, the country director of International Justice Mission, where Kimani worked. ""Sadly, since the deaths of our three friends, we have continued to witness more killings by police,"" he added. The bodies of Kimani, Josephat Mwenda and Joseph Muiruri were found dumped in a river on the outskirts of the capital, Nairobi. Kimani was defending motorbike taxi driver Mwenda who had accused policeman Fredrick Leliman of shooting him for no reason at a traffic stop in 2015. Kimani, Mwenda and their taxi driver Muiruri were last seen on 23 June 2016 at a police station. Their mutilated bodies were recovered two weeks later in a river almost 100km (62 miles) from the city. Kenya's Independent Policing Oversight Authority has recorded more than 6,000 complaints, according to data the agency has gathered since its creation 11 years ago, but few officers have been prosecuted.

Greece country profile,"The historical and cultural heritage of Greece continues to resonate throughout the modern Western world - in its literature, art, philosophy and politics. Situated in the far south of the Balkan peninsula, Greece combines the towering mountains of the mainland with over 1,400 islands, the largest of which is Crete. Post-World War Two Greece saw rapid economic and social change, with tourism and shipping becoming major contributors to the economy. The global financial crisis of the late 2000s had a devastating effect on Greece, as the legacy of high public spending and widespread tax evasion combined with the credit crunch and the resulting recession to leave the country with a crippling debt burden. President: Katerina Sakellaropoulou  Katerina Sakellaropoulou was elected president by parliament in January 2020, and took office in March, becoming Greece's first female head of state. Prior to her election, she was president of the Council of State, the country's highest administrative court. The presidency is a largely ceremonial post, as executive power resides with the prime minister. Prime Minister: Kyriakos Mitsotakis Kyriakos Mitsotakis led the centre-right New Democracy party to a landslide victory in snap elections in July 2019. Since taking over as leader of New Democracy in 2016, Mr Mitsotakis has balanced promises of lower taxes and increased investment with a firmly nationalist line on the question of relations with North Macedonia - the main foreign-policy breakthrough of the previous government. A member of a prominent political dynasty, he has also pledged to negotiate a new deal with foreign creditors to free up funds for economic development. The outgoing government, an anti-austerity coalition of the left-wing Syriza and right-wing Independent Greeks parties, had to accept tough public-spending demands by the European and International Monetary Fund in the summer of 2015.  This put the economy on course for recovery from crippling levels of indebtedness since the 2008 international credit crunch, but disappointed many of the government's supporters. Aware of this, New Democracy made a strong election pitch to those younger Greeks who still endure high levels of unemployment. Television is Greece's most popular medium. Established privately-owned networks operate alongside the public broadcaster ERT. The government has sought to regulate the TV sector, and five national networks were licensed in 2018. Press freedom in Greece suffered serious setbacks in 2021 and 2022, according to the media rights group Reporters Without Borders, with journalists regularly prevented from covering issues from migration to Covid-19.

Japanese enraged by sushi diner food prank videos,"Videos of unhygienic pranks at sushi belt restaurants in Japan have forced chains to instate new dining rules for customers and threaten legal action. The phrase ""sushi terrorism"" emerged on Japanese social media this week after a video went viral showing a teenage boy covertly licking soy bottles on a sushi conveyor belt and putting them back. The video, taken at a Sushiro diner in Gifu city, appears to have inspired copycats. This has sparked a  huge outcry online. On Twitter, Japanese users described the sabotage as ""sickening"" and expressed fears about eating at sushi train restaurants. Many also criticised offenders - who appear to be mainly children. ""What did you do to my favourite sushi?"" one user wrote.  Another cried: ""Where did our morals go?"" The videos have caused an uproar in Japan, known for its high standards of cleanliness.  The Gifu video on 29 January was followed by other videos - some with older timestamps. These have gained more than 40 million views. One showed customers spoiling passing sushi plates by heaping wasabi on top of them. Another showed a diner licking the spoon in a communal green tea powder container. The Gifu incident prompted a 5% slump in the Sushiro parent company's stock price earlier this week, although it later recovered. In a statement, Sushiro noted the teenager in the first viral video had apologised but the chain had launched a formal police complaint. ""As a company, we will continue to respond firmly with both criminal and civil cases,"" Sushiro said. It said it had replaced all soy sauce bottles at the targeted Gifu store, and was instating new dining rules for customers as a result of the prank. Customers in the region will now have to take utensils and condiments to their tables from a service point. Diners will also be able to request disinfected tableware. Two other affected restaurant chains, Hama-sushi and Kura Sushi, also plan to take legal action, Japanese media reported. Kura said it had plans to install cameras above conveyor belts to monitor customers, Jiji press agency reported. Conveyor belt sushi restaurants have been a staple in Japan for decades and there were expressions of support for the restaurant chains online this week. Some tweeted messages with the hashtag #saveSushiro. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64508029
Willie Kimani: Kenyan policemen guilty of murdering human rights lawyer,"A Kenyan court has found three policemen and a civilian guilty of the murder of a human rights lawyer and two other people in June 2016.   The bodies of Willie Kimani, his client and a taxi driver were found after they had been dumped in a river on the outskirts of the capital, Nairobi.   The case caused national outrage and highlighted the many extrajudicial killings and disappearances that have been blamed on the Kenyan police.  A fourth policeman was acquitted.  ""I am satisfied that there was no other reasonable hypothesis that can be made on the basis of the evidence before me except that of guilt,"" Judge Jessie Lessit ruled.  Kimani was defending motorbike taxi driver Josephat Mwenda who had accused policeman Fredrick Leliman - one of the three officers found guilty - of shooting him for no reason at a traffic stop in 2015. Kimani, Mwenda and their taxi driver Joseph Muiruri were last seen on 23 June 2016 at a police station.  Their mutilated bodies were recovered two weeks later in a river almost 100km (62 miles) from the city.  Outside court, Kimani's widow Hanna said the verdict had brought justice and was ""a source of comfort to our hearts, even though it may not bring Kimani back"". ""At least Kimani will not be included in the statistics of people who went through torture, went to abduction, tortured and killed without getting justice,"" she said.  Benson Shamala, the Kenya director of International Justice Mission, where Kimani worked said: ""No-one should go through what our friends... went through and especially from the very people mandated to protect them."" Kenya's Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) has recorded more than 6,000 complaints, according to data the agency has gathered since its creation 10 years ago, but few officers have been prosecuted.  Mr Shamala said that Friday's judgement showed that Kenya's justice system was capable of ""delivering justice in cases of police abuse of power"". ""This landmark decision will send a strong message to rogue police officers who abuse their powers that they will be held accountable under the law,"" he said in a statement.  IJM commended the prosecutors adding that since the 2016 killings, more than 40 police officers had been convicted of murder or manslaughter.  Sentencing for the three officers and the civilian, who was as a police informant, will be announced at a later date. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-62264439
Fraud claims against Adani group spark political row in India,"A US research firm's allegations of fraud against billionaire Gautam Adani's business empire have sparked a political row in India. Opposition leaders stalled the functioning of parliament for a second straight day on Friday as they demanded an investigation into the claims. The research firm accused Adani group firms of stock manipulation and financial fraud last week, sending its shares into a nosedive. The group has denied the allegations. On Friday, morning sessions in both houses of India's parliament were adjourned as opposition leaders demanded an investigation. They have called for a Joint Parliamentary Committee or a Supreme Court-monitored panel to be set up to investigate the allegations against the firm and the risk to Indian investors from the fall in Adani company shares. The Adani group's companies have seen $108bn wiped off their market value over the past few days after US-based investment firm Hindenburg Research published a report accusing it of decades of ""brazen"" stock manipulation and accounting fraud. The group has dismissed the allegations as malicious and untrue, calling them an ""attack on India"". But the response has failed to stop the fall in Adani shares. Gautam Adani, the founder, has fallen out of the top 10 richest in the world. According to the Forbes real-time billionaires list, Mr Adani is now the 15th-richest person in the world, with a net worth of $74.7bn. He was third on the list last week. The billionaire runs Adani Group, one of India's biggest companies. The flagship company Adani Enterprises has operations in a wide range of industries including commodities trading, airports, utilities and renewable energy. Opposition lawmakers had disrupted parliamentary proceedings on Thursday as well, after their notices to suspend business to discuss the Adani issue were rejected by the government. ""There should also be day-to-day reporting of the investigation on the issue,"" Mallikarjun Kharge, chief of the main opposition Congress party, said. The Congress has also accused the government of forcing several public institutions to invest in the firm, jeopardising people's savings. The government has not responded yet. The party has announced that it will hold nationwide protests outside the offices of Adani Group companies, nationalised banks and public institutions on Monday. Congress leader KC Venugopal has accused the BJP-led government of ""using common people's money to support their closest friends"". Mr Adani is perceived as being close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and has long faced allegations from opposition politicians that he has benefited from his political ties, which he denies.

One of Northumbria Police's oldest officers dies aged 102,"Tributes have been paid after a Northumbria Police veteran died two days after his 102nd birthday. Eric Maville, from Kirkcudbright in Scotland, served in the RAF and took part in a raid in Germany in 1944. He later joined the force and went on to serve Morpeth, Shilbottle, Amble and later Berwick and Whitley Bay, in the north-east of England. The ""modest"" father and husband was believed to be one of the force's oldest surviving veterans. He had been due to become the oldest member of the National Association for Retired Police Officers' Northumbria branch.  Eric joined the County Home Guard, aged 15, at the start of World War Two, and became an RAF Air Gunner, flying in 30 missions. He was later involved in a raid on a bomb research facility in Peenemunde, Germany, which saw 40 planes shot down by enemy aircraft. His efforts were honoured by King George VI at Buckingham Palace in 1944, his family said. From there Eric joined the police force, formerly known as Northumberland County Constabulary in 1969, and later Northumbria Police in 1974. In that time, he was invited to represent the force during Queen Elizabeth II's Coronation and later undertook a secondment as a sergeant in the UK unit of Cyprus Police.  A ""no-nonsense"" police officer, he moved up in what is now Northumbria Police, sometimes acting as inspector, and retired as a sergeant in 1977. However, Eric decided to return to work and joined Newcastle Airport Police, working there until he finally retired in 1985. Following his retirement, Eric and his wife Cynthia, 93, spent a number of years in Cyprus before returning to the UK and settling in North Tyneside.  ""He was very reserved until you got to know him - and very loyal to his friends and family,"" their son Andrew said. ""In recent years, with failing health, he never complained about his lot - and all the nurses and carers who looked after him remarked on how lovely he was."" Andrew said Eric, who was also father to Lesley, would be ""greatly missed by us all"". A spokesperson for Northumbria Police said the force was ""grateful for all Eric did during his life to serve and protect his country"".

Cancer patient urges politicians to fix Northern Ireland health system,"A seriously ill patient at Craigavon Area Hospital has made a public appeal from her hospital bed for Northern Ireland's health service to be given more resources. Colette Terris, 62, from County Armagh, called for politicians to unite to help ease problems as the health system continues to come under pressure. Ms Terris has an incurable form of cancer. Complications recently led to her lower body being paralysed. She said the full extent of her condition could have been diagnosed earlier but there was a delay in an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan being carried out over the Christmas period. The Southern Health Trust has acknowledged that there are some days when scanning is not available in Craigavon and has apologised for added distress that can cause patients. Although Ms Terris believed there should have been better scanning provision she praised the doctors and nurses who have been involved in her treatment. ""I have nothing but utter admiration for the nurses and the doctors,"" she said. ""They have looked after me, they have fed me, they have changed my nappies. That's not an easy thing to talk about."" Speaking from her hospital bed, in an interview conducted online, Ms Terris explained why she had contacted BBC News NI to share her story. ""I have a serious condition and I am not likely to be around for a long time,"" she said. ""These things are not impossible to fix. Get your fingers out and change something for the higher good of the vast majority of people. ""The people that I elected, I want them to do business and I want them to get on with it. ""Let's face it, if the health service was privatised I wouldn't be getting treatment - we wouldn't be having this conversation because I'd be dead."" Asked about the recent strike by nurses, she said she supported the industrial action and would be on the picket line herself if she could get out of bed. Ms Terris is a retired yoga teacher and led an active life before being struck by illness in recent years. She was diagnosed in 2018 with multiple myeloma, which is an incurable disease. At Christmas last year her pain level became acute and she was taken into hospital in Craigavon. There were fears, she said, of a spinal cord compression but an MRI scan could not be carried out within 24 hours. It was another four days, she said, before it took place. ""Had I been able to have an MRI, where would I be today? Probably in a very different space,"" Ms Terris said. ""No doctor should be in a position where they have to tell somebody that they can't have an MRI even though they need one within 24 hours to reduce the risk of them losing the power of their legs. ""Or worse, end up dead because they can't have an MRI because it's the weekend or it's a bank holiday or there's no emergency MRI. ""It's just mind-blowing."" Northern Ireland's Department for Health gets about half of Stormont's £14bn budget for public services. There has been a long series of independent reports suggesting the transformation of services to use that money more effectively but little political action. This week there was a warning that public services provided by Northern Ireland Executive departments face cuts of at least £500m in the new financial year. Part of the reason for the falling budget was the need to bring forward about £330m to this financial year to deal with an overspend. ""The MRI service in Craigavon Area Hospital is operational at weekends (Saturdays and Sundays from 09:00 until 17:00) but does not include bank holidays,"" a Southern Health Trust spokesperson said. ""We sincerely apologise for the added distress this can cause patients and families. ""Whilst we are unable to comment on any individual patient, we take all concerns about the care we provide extremely seriously. ""We recognise that this is a very difficult time for the family and continue to work closely with them."" Ms Terris insisted her complaint was about the system and not the staff at the hospital. ""I'm in absolute awe and admiration of the care that they give."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64506125

PM Rishi Sunak on rapist case: Biological sex 'really matters',"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said biological sex ""really matters"" after he was asked about the case of a rapist who was sent to a women's prison. Isla Bryson was convicted of attacking two women while known as a man called Adam Graham.  One of the victims later said she was sure Bryson was pretending to be trans to ""make life easier"". And First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was sure Bryson was ""almost certainly"" faking being trans. Bryson was moved from Cornton Vale to the male prison estate after a public outcry. The case was put to the prime minister in an interview with Piers Morgan for Talk TV to mark Mr Sunak's first 100 days in office. Morgan said the case showed the problem of ""limitless gender self-identity"".  Mr Sunak said it demonstrated ""some of the challenges"", but added ""we must and should have enormous compassion and tolerance and understanding for those who are questioning their gender and identity"". ""But we have to recognise the challenges that that poses, particularly for women's safety,"" the prime minister said. ""For me, whether it's sex, whether it's women's spaces, whether it's prisons, biological sex really matters."" During the interview, Morgan asked Mr Sunak for his definition of a woman.  The prime minister replied ""adult human female"", but suggested the TV presenter was actually asking about society's handling of people questioning their gender identity. Scottish government legislation aimed at allowing people to self-identify their legal sex has been blocked by the UK government over its potential impact on equalities laws, including on female-only spaces.  The move was described as a ""full-frontal assault"" on the Scottish Parliament by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. The first minister has also accused some opponents of the gender reforms of being transphobic and ""deeply misogynist, often homophobic, possibly some of them racist as well"". On Thursday, Ms Sturgeon refused to say whether she regarded Bryson as being female after being asked by Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross.  Ms Sturgeon said she did not have enough information to say whether Bryson's claim to be a woman was valid or not. She added: ""What is relevant is that the individual is a rapist. That is how the individual should be described"". However, the first minister later agreed that Bryson was ""almost certainly"" faking being trans.  Justice Secretary Keith Brown told BBC Scotland earlier this week that ""if somebody presents as a trans person then we accept that on face value."" Bryson was found guilty last month of raping two women in 2016 and 2019 while known as a man called Adam Graham. She announced after being charged with the two rapes that she now identified as female, with the court hearing that she had started the process of gender re-assignment.  Bryson was initially taken to a unit at Cornton Vale in Stirling after being found guilty, before being moved to a male wing at HMP Edinburgh a few days later following a public outcry.  She had been able to enrol on a beauty course at Ayrshire College, where she was known as Annie, while awaiting trial and remained there for three months before being asked to leave. Her classmates were almost exclusively female and much younger than Bryson, and were not aware of the rape allegations. One former classmate said she felt ""violated"" after learning of the crimes Bryson had committed. Scottish government officials have been working colleges and universities with the aim of producing guidance to address concerns about alleged sex offenders enrolling on courses while awaiting trial.  On Sunday a ""pause"" was placed on the transfer to women's jails of trans inmates with convictions for violence. It followed reports that another transgender woman, Tiffany Scott - who was convicted of stalking a 13-year-old girl before her transition and has a history of violence  - was due to be moved to a female prison.  Loose Women host India Willoughby - who was Britain's first transgender national television newsreader - told the BBC's Question Time that the ""toxic"" debate around transgender issues was being driven by ""a lot of misinformation by a media that is completely transphobic"". She claimed that stories of transgender prisoners being placed in spaces with other women were ""not true"", adding: ""There is categorically no way somebody who has committed rape would be moved into the women's estate."" She said: ""There are bad apples in all walks of life. There are bad Protestants, there are bad Catholics, bad lesbians, or bad gays, and yes, there are bad trans people. ""And all of those people, if they do something criminal and are found guilty, they deserve to go to jail and to be punished in a jail that is suitable for them and where everybody else is safe.""

Flybe pilot says company was recruiting day before collapse,"A former Flybe pilot who has lost his job for the second time in three years has said the company was recruiting the day before it went into administration. Keith Sivell had been planning to move his family from Glasgow to Belfast. But after waking up for his early shift last Saturday he found out he was out of a job through messages on his phone. Flybe's administrator confirmed that 277 staff were being made redundant, including many at Belfast City Airport. The airline had only restarted its operations in April last year after a previous collapse in 2020. Mr Sivell told BBC News NI: ""As you've just been woken up at four o'clock in the morning there's a little bit of confusion, trying to figure out what's happening - is it true? ""Do I go to the airport? Are flights still going? ""[It's] strange to say we weren't surprised - we weren't surprised but we were shocked. ""We'd been told by the company originally that there'd been two to three years [of] finances even if we were flying around with low numbers of passengers so that's really where the shock came from."" Flybe operated 10 routes from Belfast City Airport, including services to Heathrow, Manchester, Glasgow and Amsterdam. When Flybe collapsed in 2020 it was responsible for about 80% of Belfast City Airport's flights. More recently Flybe made up about 14% of flights at the airport. Flybe's plans were significantly disrupted by delays in new aircraft arriving and reduced demand for travel. It is understood that led to an estimated £30m in lost revenue and additional costs, and that the airline was losing up to £5m a month before its collapse. Mr Sivell said: ""We went into administration early on the 28th of January and there was recruitment going on on the 27th - just the day before - for pilots."" Many of the pilots who were working for Flybe when it previously collapsed returned to work for the airline last year because of the nature of their licences and training. Keith had worked at the previous incarnation of Flybe for seven years and loved it, saying he was delighted to go back. ""When you work as a small team, everyone at the briefing table together, it was a really friendly, family environment so that's why I came back,"" he said. ""All the crews in Belfast got on really well so it does feel like you're saying goodbye to family members when it collapses."" He said that at the time of the previous collapse the staff knew company finances were tight but this time it feels ""more like the rug has been pulled from underneath us"" and many are ""still stunned"" that it has happened. Jobs prospects were more bleak in 2020 because of the impact of the Covid pandemic and travel restrictions on the aviation industry. Now airlines have already been in touch with pilots to offer opportunities. Keith is not looking for a new job immediately as his wife has just returned to work as an anaesthetist after having a baby so his focus will be on childcare. ""Everyone in this situation, you're thinking how can you get a job but also how can we cut our overheads immediately,"" he said. ""It will be an absolute silver lining to be able to spend time with my family."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64497531
Andrew Barlow: Serial rapist due to be released despite appeal,"A man who was jailed for 13 rapes is due to be released despite an appeal from the justice secretary. The Parole Board rejected an application from Dominic Raab to cancel the scheduled release of Andrew Barlow. Previously called Andrew Longmire, he attacked young women mainly in Manchester in the 1980s.  One attack included the rape of a 26-year-old woman in her Sheffield home, while her three-year-old daughter hid terrified behind a settee. He broke into his victims' homes, using weapons to threaten them - and in one case to cause injury - before assaulting them, often while children were in the same house. Barlow, from Bolton, was jailed for life in 1988 with a minimum term of 20 years for 11 rapes, three attempted rapes and other offences. He was found guilty of a 12th rape in 2010 and another one in 2017.  After spending more than 34 years in jail, the Parole Board decided in December that Barlow could be released. It has since rejected an application to reconsider from Mr Raab, who said the panel had ""failed to take proper account of the evidence regarding risk and in particular the expert psychology evidence"". There were slightly differing reports about safety from two psychologists, with one saying Barlow was considered safe, while the other said he should be ""further tested in 'open' [jail]"" before being confirmed for release. The Parole Board rejected Mr Raab's application, saying ""there has been no misdirection of law"", and the panel had considered ""all the evidence"". It said panel members favoured the report of the first psychologist and ""it was entitled to reach that conclusion"". The board added Barlow's ""risk management plan with its extensive list of conditions"" would be ""sufficiently robust"" to manage his return to public life. ""The whole panel would be aware of the correct test and the panel was chaired by a very experienced retired judge who also has considerable experience of parole hearings and applying the statutory test,"" the board said. But their decision may be challenged through an appeal to the High Court. A Ministry of Justice representative says the case ""emphasises the need for reform of the parole system"" and ""ministerial oversight of the most serious cases"". In 2021, after the re-arrest of Colin Pitchfork - who raped and murdered two teenage girls in the 1980s - Mr Raab said he wanted to see a more cautious approach to future parole decisions.   Pitchfork had been recalled to prison two months after his release.   Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Lollipop crossing patrol staff recruitment frozen in NI,"The recruitment of school crossing patrol staff is being frozen by the Education Authority as part of an effort to save money. It has encouraged schools to share road safety advice with pupils and parents. Youth services are also facing cuts to day trips and educational visits. In a letter to school principals, the authority's chief executive Sara Long said it had identified savings of about £17.8m it could make in 2022-23. But that is far short of £110m in cuts it is expected to make from its budget by 31 March. The Education Authority spends the bulk of Stormont's £2.5bn education budget on funding schools, staff, transport, meals, maintenance, youth services and support for children with special educational needs (SEN). The authority's board previously said it could not make cuts of £110m without ""highly unacceptable and detrimental risks"" to children and young people. In his November 2022 budget, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris warned that the Department of Education needed to make significant cuts to its ""current spending trajectory"". He said that although education would receive a cash increase of £286m compared to last year's baseline the department would need to take action to live within its budget this year. The Department of Education has also asked the Education Authority to model cuts of up to 10% of its 2023-24 budget. The authority's chief executive has now written to schools to outline savings of £17.8m it can make this financial year. Among the savings is a pause on ""the recruitment of temporary and permanent school crossing patrol (SCP) posts"". ""Schools are encouraged to share the road safety advice available on [the] NI Direct [website], as well as reinforce parents' important role in their child's journey to school,"" wrote Ms Long. ""Schools are also reminded of existing guidance that only those employed as a SCP are authorised to stop traffic and therefore indemnified in the event of an accident."" There are about 350 school crossing patrol staff in Northern Ireland. Ms Long also said the authority would try to save money on school meals. ""We will review menus across all educational sectors with a view to improving the attractiveness of offer, increasing uptake and reducing excess wastage of perishable items,"" she said. ""The impact on nutritional guidelines will be minimised as much as possible."" Among the other areas earmarked for savings are recruitment freezes for some Education Authority staff posts and restrictions on staff travel. Ms Long also appealed to schools and boards of governors to ""constrain your school's expenditure for the remainder of this year"". In a separate letter, she said Education Authority-funded youth service trips would also be affected. ""All educational visit categories (day trips, residential and international visits) planned by any statutory youth service setting, utilising core funding, will be reviewed and recommended for pause or cancellation until the end of March 2023,"" she wrote. ""Educational visits planned through external funding, or self-raised funding by children and young people, will remain unaffected."" She added that there would be a reduction in the administration support that the Education Authority could provide to the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme.

Stormont marks one year of political stalemate,"Cast an eye towards Stormont and nothing looks out of place - the gates are open and the lights are on. But inside there has been a political power outage that has now hit the one-year mark. It has been 365 days since the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) formally exited the executive over its opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol. When Paul Givan announced his resignation as first minister he said he hoped that a resolution allowing his party to re-enter government would be found soon. But, depending on your definition of soon, it could be argued that a 12-month political stalemate was not what he or his party had in mind when they began their walkout. Despite speculation just days ago about a new deal on the protocol being close, London and Brussels have yet to announce a breakthrough.  Mr Givan, who spent eight months as first minister, insists the DUP did the right thing. ""Had we not taken action we were continuing to drift and people weren't taking the concerns of unionists seriously,"" he said. ""I didn't want that to be the case but people didn't listen. ""Now they are listening, now they are engaging and now they need to produce a result we can buy into and unionism can support."" Power in Number 10, though, has switched hands several times since the executive collapsed last February. Boris Johnson was ditched by the Conservatives in favour of former Foreign Secretary Liz Truss who led the protocol bill to Parliament - legislation that would have allowed UK ministers to scrap large parts of the arrangements if negotiations with the EU fell apart. After her short-lived stint as prime minister, Rishi Sunak entered the frame and, instead of pursuing the contentious protocol bill, set about trying to change the mood with EU officials. This week there have been rumours and reports that, if necessary, the new prime minister is prepared to do a deal with Brussels that the DUP may not support. The official line from Number 10 is it wants a deal that will ultimately help restore power-sharing at Stormont. But behind the scenes the thinking could be quite different, according to Ailbhe Rea from Politico's Westminster Insider podcast. ""It's not just the people around Rishi Sunak but a wider feeling among different bits of the Conservative Party that when they're being honest, it would be difficult to get a deal the DUP would be happy with,"" she said. ""Even people from the Liz Truss era would know that is a difficult sell. ""Brexit and the protocol are not what Rishi Sunak wants to be focused on, it's like a barnacle on the bottom of a boat the government just wants to get rid of."" Other factors will also affect any decision DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson takes about whether to go back into government - not least an upcoming council election in May, according to the Belfast Telegraph's political editor Suzanne Breen. ""He is a devolutionist,"" she said. ""He is actually, despite what his critics say, a political moderate, but he doesn't want to do so at the expense of his party losing votes and plummeting in the polls. ""He knows that Jim Allister and the TUV [Traditional Unionist Voice] are not a spent force and are still very much breathing down his neck."" While the DUP has said it feels no pressure to end its protest over the protocol, at the same time protesters across the public sector have been putting pressure on Stormont for extra financial support. Sinn Féin, now the largest party in the assembly after last year's election, has said it is being blocked from providing that help. ""People rightfully want their elected politicians to go in and do the job that they should be doing,"" the party's Belfast North MP John Finucane explained. ""One year on the DUP should be reflecting on what they've actually achieved with their walkout because all they have achieved is punishing workers, families and those impacted by the health service more than anybody else."" As one of the newly elected assembly members last May, Kate Nicholl from the Alliance Party has yet to spend a day doing her full job. She said she's still hopeful that the institutions will return but, like many others, cannot hazard a guess as to when that might be. ""Devolution matters and ministers with local budgets delivering for local people matters,"" said Ms Nicholl. ""I believe we will get it up and running but I am very concerned about the long-term damage the absence of an assembly has had, not just in terms of being able to legislate and strategise, but the impact it has on public confidence in us."" Of course, it took three years to sort out the previous stalemate that ended in January 2020. We are still some way off equalling that recent record, but few would bet on a resolution coming much quicker this time. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64506227
"Butterflies in major decline in Northern Ireland, says report","One of Northern Ireland's butterflies appears to be on the edge of extinction, while others are struggling, according to a report. But a species only found in Northern Ireland, the Cryptic Wood White, is doing better. Scientists have warned that time is running out to halt the decline of butterflies across the UK. A charity involved in the report, Butterfly Conservation has called for targeted action and more resources. Butterflies are regarded as a barometer for climate change and habitat loss as they react quickly to any change in their ecosystem. The first State of the UK's Butterflies report since 2015 showed 80% of species were declining in abundance, distribution or both in the last 50 years. There are 59 species of breeding butterflies in the UK. Many, though not all, of the species found in Northern Ireland have been monitored for the report. It shows a 17% decrease in abundance and a 10% decrease in distribution of butterflies. There are concerns that the Wall butterfly is dying out, with the report saying it was in ""precipitous decline"". There were only three reported sightings of that butterfly, all on the County Down coast, in the space of five years. Another butterfly, the Small Heath, has lost 40% of its distribution since 1995. But there have been improvements in the numbers of some species. The Dark Green Fritillary, Silver-washed Fritillary and the Holly Blue have expanded across Northern Ireland, thanks to the availability of suitable habitat. And the Cryptic Wood White has shown improvement in its numbers since previous assessments. Julie Williams, the chief executive of Butterfly Conservation, said the report showed compelling evidence of nature's decline in the UK. ""We need swift and effective action on this,"" she said. ""The decline in butterflies we have seen in our own lifetimes is shocking and we can no longer stand by and watch the UK's biodiversity be destroyed."" The report was compiled by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology and the British Trust for Ornithology. Nearly 23 million butterfly records were gathered for it, mostly by people taking part in the UK Butterfly Monitoring scheme and the Butterflies for the New Millennium scheme. The amount of recording has allowed the data to be broken down across the four nations of the UK. Only Scotland has shown long-term increases, with butterflies in England faring the worst. The report authors say more data is needed to assess trends in some of the rarest and most threatened species in Northern Ireland, which are seeing greater declines across the UK as a whole.

Bid for faster trains on England-Wales border,"Plans to improve public transport in communities on the England-Wales border have been released. Put forward by transport body Midlands Connect, the proposals include road and rail improvements across the Shropshire Marches as well as Mid and West Wales. Helen Morgan, the Liberal Democrat MP for North Shropshire, said the area was being ""held back by a lack of public transport"" and change was ""crucial"". Midlands Connect will submit the plans to the government and request funding. ""This document outlines a series of road and rail projects that we believe could unlock the full economic potential of the Marches and Mid and West Wales,"" said the body's CEO, Maria Machancoses. She said the plans had been drawn up in collaboration with the Welsh government but will need approval from Westminster. For road users, the plans also suggest upgrading the A5 and delivering the Llanymynech - Pant bypass and improvements to the A49 ""as soon as possible"". ""All these improvements would help bind the union together but help Herefordshire, Shropshire and Telford and Wrekin get the rail and road improvements they need,"" said Ms Machancoses.

Autism: Employers ignorant about disability - autistic man,"""A lot of employers are really ignorant."" Autistic man Nath Trevett, from Rhondda Cynon Taf, said employers often misinterpreted autism traits and need training to support people at work. While 53.6% of all disabled people are in work, that figure is only 21.7% for autistic people, according to the Office for National Statistics. The National Autistic Society called it a ""waste of talent"" while the Welsh government vowed to improve job access. Autism means people may act differently to the way the others do The Equality Act 2010 made it harder for employers to unfairly screen out disabled people and ensured there was a duty to make reasonable adjustments for people at a substantial disadvantage because of their disability. But Nath, a part-time Welsh translator, said there were still barriers and did not realise until he was made redundant how difficult it was for people like him to find work. He said: ""I really find it stressful actually making applications and looking for work. A lot of employers are really ignorant and that has an effect. ""They don't know anything about autism and so they won't appreciate that people on the spectrum think and talk in a different way and I just think that's ignorant and discriminating."" Nath said he was ""fortunate"" to be employed by an understanding organisation but thinks others are not as lucky. ""One symptom is that people with autism have a tendency to go into detail and I just hate it when an employer jumps to the conclusion that is a bit too much and think that they're in inappropriate for the role when they're actually trying to do is win their trust,"" he said. ""There needs to be a lot more education and training and understanding and acceptance otherwise people on the spectrum will only go on suffering and feel discriminated and be rejected and it's just not good for anyone's mental health."" He said employers needed to realise that ""not all autistic people suffer in the same way as each other"" so they can adapt accordingly. Andrew Edwards struggled for seven years to get a job before eventually getting employed at Your Space Marches, an autism charity based in Wrexham. He worked at a football broadcasting channel in the early 2000s and said, at that time, few people had experience with autistic people. ""People with autism need step by step guidance that is clear. They can bring a lot of skills to the job in that they will be very dedicated and enthusiastic but it is more keeping the job is the issue"". He said he would struggle to work a traditional 40-hour week and some autistic people may struggle to work but employers should be encouraged to be flexible. ""It would drain me too much emotionally and physically and my mental health would suffer to work full time,"" he said. Because of this, Andrew is also on benefits to help subsidise his income and said being able to work flexibly gave him and his family ""freedom"" and ""a sense of purpose"" after his mother died. Karen Davies works with an employability service at Pembrokeshire council as part of initiative to help get more autistic people in work. The workshop in Haverfordwest is preparing its trainees for manufacturing jobs and has received a grant from the Department for Work and Pensions. In 2018, they employed 15 disabled people which has now risen to 70 and includes a number of autistic people.  Ms Davies said: ""We have three cafes, a shop, a sawmill, and admin and social media, all of which support people with a wide range of disabilities within the workplace."" She said the group wanted to showcase the skills of people with disabilities and encourage workplaces to make changes. ""Our focus will be educating employers in the processes we have developed in-house so that other employers can take people with autism and support them in their workplace."" The National Autistic Society said it was very concerned about the employment gap. External affairs manager Chris Haines said autistic people ""deserve the same opportunity as everybody else to succeed in work and reach their potential"". ""The employment gap remains far too wide and we're really concerned that autistic people have some of the lowest rates of employment of any group. We think is a huge waste of talent."" While it is not possible for every autistic person to be in work, he said small changes employers could make, such as quiet spaces, using clear and precise language and staff training, could make a ""big difference"". He wants the Welsh government's young person's guarantee of training and work to be accessible to autistic people, coupled with a national campaign ""to improve understanding"" of autism among employers. A Welsh government spokeswoman said: ""Our network of disabled people's employment champions are playing a vital role in helping to create a culture shift in attitudes to help autistic people in the workplace."" She added that there were a number of pilot schemes in place to improve the experience of autistic people. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64452997
Pembrokeshire: Top councillor accused of possible data breach,"A senior councillor has been accused of creating an online voting system that could have potentially allowed members' votes on budget cuts to be tracked. Opposition members in Pembrokeshire council raised concerns about an external site containing sensitive information, the link for which was distributed by councillor Alec Cormack. Some councillors questioned whether it could be used to track confidential responses. Mr Cormack declined to comment.  Pembrokeshire council is investigating whether data breaches had occurred. The council needs to save £28m during 2023-24, and councillors will soon be expected to vote on budget proposals.  The BBC has learned that councillors received an email containing an individual link from Mr Cormack, who is the council's cabinet member for finance, prior to a budget seminar on 27 January. The private individual links connect to an external website, pembs.net, which includes information about potential budget savings for the forthcoming budget, and another page for councillors to vote on various options. It is not clear why the website was set up externally rather than on the council's own server. The email to councillors was sent from Mr Cormack's council email address, but links to an external website which is hosted on a server that includes a number of websites, including one for his own IT business and Pembrokeshire Liberal Democrats.  Mr Cormack, a Liberal Democrat, is described on his corporate website as a ""proven IT leader"" with 20 years' experience in corporate IT. It is understood concerns about the security of the website were raised during the budget seminar, which was held at County Hall, Haverfordwest. After the row, councillors refused to vote on possible budget options using the website.  One of those who was unhappy was councillor Jacob Williams.  When approached by the BBC, Mr Williams said that because Mr Cormack was the administrator of the site, he was theoretically ""able to record each and every member's interactions and save that data to use for his own purposes"", which would amount to a ""gross breach of trust"". Another opposition councillor, who did not want to be named, told the BBC the website in question could have breached data protection laws, as he claims the website had no obvious privacy or cookie policy.  Cookies can technically be used to track a user's browsing activity. Alec Cormack declined to comment when asked about the concerns, and referred all enquiries to Pembrokeshire council. A Pembrokeshire council spokesperson said: ""Following a members' budget seminar on Friday afternoon, a concern was raised around the use of a platform not hosted by the council, which was designed to take members views on budget saving options.  ""As a result of the concern raised, the platform was not used and we are looking into whether there may have been any information security or other breaches.""

Strictly star Hamza can't wait for Scotland's home crowd roar,"Strictly Come Dancing winner Hamza Yassin has said he cannot wait to hear the Glasgow crowd when the live show comes to Scotland.  The programme's live tour will be in the city for the last of nine stops. Hamza is expecting half of his Ardnamurchan community to turn up to see him dancing on the arena stage.  The Sudan-born wildlife presenter said the villagers of Kilchoan had been a huge support throughout the competition, which he won in December.  Hamza told BBC Scotland's The Edit he thought his return to Scotland with dance partner Jowita Przystal for five shows at Glasgow's Ovo Hydro next week was ""going to be amazing"". ""I can't wait to hear the roar of Glasgow,"" Hamza said. ""I'm hoping that the home crowd gets behind both of us.  ""We just want to say thank you to everybody."" In the final of the 20th series of the BBC One celebrity dance show, Hamza won the viewers vote, but he was particularly touched by the support from his neighbours in the most westerly village in mainland Britain. About 50 or 60 people - half of the inhabitants - gathered in the community hall each week to watch him compete and will him into the final. ""Everyone was just really proud and I was proud of them for their support helping me out through the whole journey,"" he said.  Hamza had never had dance lessons before taking part in Strictly but villagers claimed credit for brining out his inner dancer at community ceilidhs. ""Half the village is turning up [to the live show],"" Hamza said. ""One section of the audience is just going to be shouting like mad."" Hamza, 32, moved to Kilchoan, on the peninsula of Ardnamurchan beside the Sound of Mull in Lochaber, more than a decade ago and built his career as a photographer and documentary maker from there.  Having moved to the UK when he was eight, he gained degrees in zoology with conservation and biological imaging and photography before going on to work on TV programmes including The Animal Park, CBeebies' Let's Go For A Walk and Countryfile.  Hamza and professional dancer Jowita said they were loving the Strictly tour so far and had wonderful memories from the TV show. Jowita said they would be ""friends for life"" after the experience.  ""When I met Hamza I saw that he'd got this, and he'd got the moves, and he'd the ability to actually go that far and win this show,"" she said.  ""I asked him for two things - trust and energy. He gave me much more and I think everything paid off. ""He did it, he lifted that glitterball and he deserved that."" For Hamza it was a life-changing experience.  ""It's been the best thing I've ever done in my life, and I've travelled the globe,"" he admitted.  ""It's the hardest thing I've ever done, but it was a roller coaster of emotions and I had the best person beside me shining the light the whole way through it and guiding me through.""

Omagh bombing: UK government announces independent statutory inquiry,"There will be an independent statutory inquiry into the Omagh bombing, the UK government has confirmed. Twenty-nine people died after the bombing in the County Tyrone town on 15 August 1998 - the biggest single atrocity in the Troubles. Bereaved families have been campaigning for an inquiry for more than a decade. In July 2021, a Belfast court ruled there should be a new investigation into whether the attack, by the Real IRA, could have been prevented. Michael Gallagher, whose son Aiden died in the bombing, took the legal challenge that resulted in the judge directing the state to act. He welcomed NI Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris' announcement of the inquiry as ""fantastic news"".  ""I thought that it was something that I would never hear... It is a very important step forward,"" said Mr Gallagher. The government has described the inquiry as an ""independent statutory inquiry"" rather than the more well-known term ""public inquiry"". It would have the full powers of the Inquiries Act 2005, the act under which public inquiries are normally held, the Northern Ireland secretary told the House of Commons on Thursday. The act states that the chairman of a public inquiry ""must take such steps as he considers reasonable"" to allow the public and press to attend the inquiry and view a record of evidence and documents provided. But the government suggested in the case of the Omagh Inquiry, it would be up to the chairman to decide how much of the inquiry was public. Mr Heaton-Harris said the inquiry, which would be established as promptly as possible, would examine four issues identified by the 2021 High Court ruling. These include: The 2021 High Court ruling said there should be an investigation on both sides of the border into whether intelligence information could have prevented the Real IRA attack. The judge, Mr Justice Horner, said on the basis of evidence he heard it was plausible the bombing could have been stopped. At a time when the government is planning to draw a line under the past through shutting down inquests and others investigations, launching a new inquiry into the Omagh bombing will strike a chord with other victims and their families.  But the government will argue that the bombing falls outside its Troubles Legacy Bill as it happened after the 1998 Good Friday Agreement was signed. The inquiry will also have a narrow focus - to establish if the bombing could have been prevented had intelligence information been acted upon. But the lesson other victim's families will take from today is that the government will only act when the courts demand it. That is why we can expect legal challenges to the government's controversial legacy legislation when it becomes law. He did not state the investigation needed to be in the form of a public inquiry. The Northern Ireland secretary travelled to Omagh in December to meet some of the bereaved families and visit the site of the bombing and a nearby memorial garden. On Thursday, he told the House of Commons it was ""a very sobering experience"". The Omagh bomb exploded on 15 August 1998, killing 29 people including a woman pregnant with twins. The bombing came four months after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, the peace deal that eventually brought an end to decades of violence known as the Troubles. It was carried out by dissident republican group the Real IRA, which split from the much larger Provisional IRA after objecting to its ceasefire of 1997. No-one has ever been convicted of the atrocity. Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt, who died in 2021, was found responsible for the Omagh bombing in a civil case in 2009, with three other men - Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly - also being found liable for the attack. The four men were named by Mr Justice Morgan in a ruling made as part of a landmark case taken by some of the families of the victims. The 12 relatives were awarded more than £1.6m in damages for the attack but to date nothing has been paid.  Claire Radford, who was 15 at the time, lost her 16-year-old brother Alan Radford in the bombing.  She told BBC News NI that while she welcomed any inquiry, she had some reservations that the blame may be shifted from the Real IRA and onto the security forces. ""In my own heart and mind, yes, there was intelligence that should've been passed on, they could've acted on it, things could've been a lot different, but it doesn't take away from what's happened,"" she said. ""Omagh did happen. My brother isn't here. ""The impact of this lives on forever and that will go on for generations, it doesn't just end."" Michael Gallagher, whose son Aiden died in the bombing, said the inquiry was an important step forward for families who wanted to know exactly what happened.  ""We will be of course part of this but a little on the side lines,"" he told the BBC's Evening Extra programme. ""And that's not a bad thing. Because we are in the 25th year now and you do run out of energy, but it is important nevertheless to get those answers."" The weather in the town reflects the mood: dreary and dark. Many of the bereaved families have been campaigning for an inquiry into the Omagh bombing for more than a decade. Others fear it will open old wounds. It doesn't take you long to walk around the town and find people who still carry that trauma every day. ""It's a day I'll never forget,"" said one woman. ""I just remember the noise and then the silence, then the chaos and devastation that ensued after. It'll stay with me forever."" Read more here. The inquiry's announcement has been widely welcomed across the political divide in the UK and Northern Ireland. Labour shadow NI secretary Peter Kyle commended Mr Heaton-Harris for putting the victims first in his deliberations. ""The Republic of Ireland now has a moral obligation to start their own investigation,"" he added. While having no jurisdiction to order the Irish government to act on the matter, Mr Justice Horner urged authorities there to establish their own probe in light of his findings. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said the Republic of Ireland would not be found wanting"" in any inquiry into the Omagh bomb. ""There was probably a cross-border element to this crime and we are going to sit down with the UK authorities and work out how we can contribute to that,"" he told RTÉ. But Lord Saville, who chaired the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, said he was not persuaded a parallel inquiry would be a good idea. ""A parallel process... is going to double the cost but it also has the prospect of two inquiries coming to different conclusions,"" he told Evening Extra. ""I'd need a great deal of persuasion that this was a case where two inquiries is a vital element."" He said the inquest has to be through but fair, adding: ""You've got to give all those people who may be subjected to criticism the opportunity to come forward and explain what they said and did."" Former police ombudsman Baroness O'Loan, who published a report into the bombing in 2001 that was highly critical of the police, said there must be ""a sufficient degree of public hearing for there to be any confidence"" in the inquiry.   She told BBC News NI's The View: ""I think that an enormous amount of the material which will be disclosed to this inquiry will be material which has been made public previously. ""I think that will make it easier for the inquiry to hold its hearings in public."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64495873
Nicola Sturgeon: Rapist Isla Bryson 'almost certainly' faking trans status,"A double rapist who was sent to a women's prison last week is ""almost certainly"" faking being trans, Nicola Sturgeon has suggested.  Isla Bryson was convicted of attacking two women while known as a man called Adam Graham.  One of the victims later said she was sure Bryson was pretending to be trans to ""make life easier"". Bryson was moved from Cornton Vale to the male prison estate after a public outcry. A ""pause"" was subsequently placed on the transfer to women's jails of trans inmates with convictions for violence after it was reported that another transgender woman, Tiffany Scott - who was convicted of stalking a 13-year-old girl before her transition and has a history of violence  - was due to be moved to a female prison.  The Bryson case was raised at First Minister's Questions by Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross on Thursday.  Mr Ross said: ""I believe a double rapist, anyone who rapes a woman, is a man. They cannot be considered anything else. ""When a man rapes two women, we don't think that he should be considered a woman just because he says so. We should call out criminals like this who are abusing the system. ""Adam Graham, who wants to be know as Isla Bryson, raped two women. He is an abusive man seeking to exploit loopholes in the government's current policy."" Mr Ross asked the first minister: ""Is this double rapist a woman?"" Ms Sturgeon initially said she did not have enough information to say whether Bryson's claim to be a woman was valid or not.  She added: ""I don't think Douglas Ross and I are disagreeing here, because what I think is relevant in this case is not whether the individual is a man or claims to be a woman or is trans. What is relevant is that the individual is a rapist. That is how the individual should be described, and it is that that should be the main consideration in deciding how the individual is dealt with. ""That is why, of course, the individual is in a male prison, not in the female prison, these are the issues that matter."" Mr Ross went on to read a quote from one of Bryson's victims, who said: ""I don't believe he is truly transgender. I feel as if he has made a mockery out of them using it. As far as I'm concerned, that was to make things easier for himself. I'm sure he is faking it."" The first minister responded: ""My feeling is that is almost certainly the case, which is why the key factor in this case is not the individual's claim to be a woman. ""The key and in fact only important factor in this is that the individual is convicted of rape - the individual is a rapist - and that is the factor that should be the deciding one in decisions about how that prisoner is now treated."" Ms Sturgeon went on to say it was ""really important"" to ""look seriously"" at the issues thrown up by the Bryson case, adding: ""But that in doing so, we bear in mind two things. ""Firstly, as I've said, that we do not further stigmatise trans people generally - I think that is important - but secondly that we don't cause undue concern amongst the public."" Ms Sturgeon added that there were exemptions under the current UK equality law that ""even if it wanted to this parliament couldn't change"" that enabled trans women to be excluded from some single sex spaces. The Scottish Prison Service has operated a form of gender self-identification since 2014.  As Justice Secretary Keith Brown put it on BBC Radio Scotland on Monday: ""If somebody presents as a trans person then we accept that on face value."" It is that ""face value"" approach that appears to have caused such difficulty in the cases of Tiffany Scott and especially Isla Bryson, the double rapist who was initially remanded at Cornton Vale women's prison.  While identifying as trans does not give any prisoner the right to decide where they are jailed, the system does take their acquired gender into account.  Critics say that's open to abuse by predatory men but ministers say robust risk assessment should prevent that and may ultimately have excluded Bryson and Scott from the female prison estate.  When asked about the Bryson case on Monday, Justice Secretary Keith Brown told BBC Scotland's The Nine: ""We have to accept people identify - in this case - as women. I think that is commonly accepted and that's the starting approach we take."" But Mr Brown stressed that this did not mean they would automatically have the right to go to a female prison, with a ""rigorous"" risk assessment being carried out first. However, when asked earlier in the week why the gender claims of prisoners were accepted at face value, Ms Sturgeon said: ""That is the case for trans people but if you take the two cases that have been in the media, for my point of view it's not so important what gender they are, it's the crimes that they have committed."" Bryson was found guilty last month of raping two women in 2016 and 2019 before she changed gender after being arrested. While awaiting trail, she enrolled on a beauty course Ayrshire College, where she was known as Annie, and remained there for three months before being asked to leave. Her classmates were almost exclusively female and much younger than Bryson, and were not aware of the rape allegations.  One former classmate told BBC Scotland last week that she felt ""violated"" after learning of the crimes Bryson had committed.  Scottish government legislation aimed at allowing people to self-identify their legal sex has been blocked by the UK government over its potential impact on equalities laws. The UK government said during a Westminster debate on Thursday that it was up to the Scottish government to bring forward a new Gender Recognition Reform bill that addresses the legal issues which caused the bill to be blocked.   Cabinet Office minister Alex Burghart said the decision to block the legislation using what is known as a Section 35 order was used very carefully and reluctantly in order to preserve the balance of powers between Scotland and England.   SNP MP Patrick Grady said the UK government should publish its own amendments to the Bill to make it acceptable and claimed the Conservatives were undermining the Scottish Parliament. And backbench Conservative MP said he believed the legal arguments used by the government for halting the legislation were ""shaky"".

Energy firms told to stop force-fitting prepayment meters,"Energy companies have been asked by the industry regulator Ofgem to suspend the forced installation of prepayment meters.  It comes after the Times found debt agents for British Gas had broken into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters. Ofgem has asked all suppliers to review the use of court warrants to enter the homes of customers in arrears. It said firms must get their ""house in order"". Jonathan Brearley, the regulator's boss, said he had ordered the review into pre-payment meters to ""uncover poor practice"" and that he would not hesitate to take the ""strongest action in our powers"" where needed.  Prepayment meters require customers to pay for their energy in advance, either through accounts or by adding credit to a card.  They are more expensive than paying by direct debit, but are sometimes the only option for people who have struggled to pay and are in debt to a supplier. The undercover investigation by the Times revealed how agents working for Arvato Financial Solutions on behalf of British Gas had forced their way into the home of a single father-of-three to install a prepayment meter. One debt agent is reported to have said: ""This is the exciting bit. I love this bit."" Chris O'Shea, the boss of Centrica which owns British Gas, told the BBC: ""There is nothing that I can say that can express the horror I had when I heard this, when I read this. It is completely unacceptable. ""The contractor that we've employed, Arvato, has let us down but I am accountable for this."" But Mr Brearley said: ""It is astonishing for any supplier not to know about their own contractors' behaviour, especially where they are interacting with the most vulnerable in our society.""  British Gas has said it will suspend forcefully installing prepayment meters until at least after the winter. Arvato Financial Solutions has not commented. A spokesman for British Gas said it had about 1.5 million customers on prepayment meters and last year had executed around 20,000 prepayment installs with a warrant. It is the country's largest supplier with 7.26 million customers. EDF, Britain's second largest supplier, has also confirmed it is suspending the forced installation of prepayment meters and reviewing its practices.  Ovo Energy suspended its warrant activities in November and Octopus Energy said it was ""not installing any at the moment"" and rarely had done. Ofgem said energy suppliers had been asked to examine their relationships with third-party contractors and to look at ""incentives that could give rise to poor and unacceptable behaviours"".  Mr Brearley warned no energy chief executive could ""shirk their legal and moral responsibilities to protect their own customers, especially the most vulnerable"". In the case of British Gas, Mr Brearley: ""We are opening a comprehensive investigation into British Gas on this issue and we will not hesitate to take the strongest action needed,"" he added. Graham Stuart, the minister for energy and climate, said British Gas should ""hold their heads in shame"".  He told the BBC he had met all energy suppliers last week to talk about how to improve looking after vulnerable people ""because there are clear rules and they have obviously not been followed"". The discovery of how some British Gas customers had been treated was ""just appalling"", Mr Stuart said. ""I am angry, everyone should be angry. It's completely in the face of all the promises that I've been made by suppliers,"" he added. But Caroline Flynn, former shadow energy secretary who now chairs the Committee on Fuel Poverty, said the issue of forced installation of prepayment meters had been raised with the government last year following a surge at the end of summer. She told the BBC: ""It is quite clear that the rules around seeking warrants for these forced installations make it very clear that they shouldn't be done where there are vulnerable people living in households, and they just haven't been followed."" While Ms Flynn welcomed the suspension, she said it was ""right to consider whether or not forced installation of meters should happen at all"". Jane, who did not want us to use her surname, came home to her recently-bought house in Poole, Dorset, in 2014 to find that someone had been in her home, installed a prepayment meter and left a letter in the kitchen. Jane said the ""horrid"" experience had happened just after she had lost her unborn child at 17 weeks. She said she was mentally ""broken"". The now 46-year-old said she had been sent letters addressed to a previous occupant and had posted them marked 'return to sender'. Jane added she was signed up to a direct debit plan with her energy provider, and had not missed a payment. She called the firm and said it transpired that it had been the previous tenant who had been in arrears. She said a neighbour with a spare key was persuaded to let the installers in.  Jane said her energy provider had apologised on the phone for the mistake, removed the prepayment meter and credited her account with £45. ""It feels violating to have someone come into your house like that. It was so scary,"" she said. ""You could sense someone had been in. The house was freezing cold."" Strict rules apply that prevent energy firms putting an at-risk customer on a prepayment meter, but in certain circumstances customers in arrears can be moved either remotely on a smart meter, or physically after the firm has been given a warrant to do so. Suppliers are required to have exhausted all other options before installing a prepayment meter, and should not do so for those in the most vulnerable situations. Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizen Advice which has been calling for a ban on forced prepayment installations, welcomed Ofgem's announcement. ""The rotten core of debt collection practice in the energy sector has now been exposed for all to see. But this isn't a case of one bad apple,"" Ms Moriarty said.

New Porsche mistakenly put on sale at bargain price in China,"Potential car buyers in China have found that an online advert for a luxury sports car was just too good to be true. A Porsche dealership in the the city of Yinchuan listed the brand new vehicle for 124,000 yuan ($18,300, £15,000). That is just a fraction of what it should have been. The Panamera has a starting price of $148,000. The promotion attracted hundreds of would-be buyers who rushed to secure what appeared to be a bargain. A spokesperson for the German car maker told the BBC that the promotion ""contained a serious mistake in the listed retail price"", which was taken down immediately. ""As there was only one vehicle in stock, in accordance with the sales process, Porsche Centre Yinchuan has communicated with the first customer who made an online refunded reservation fee and has negotiated an agreeable outcome"", they added. The dealership also contacted ""every bidder individually and explained the situation with apology"". The incorrect information was posted on 30 January and customers who paid the 911 yuan reservation fee have been refunded, Porsche said. The incident caused a stir on Chinese social media, with one commentator posting ""This is why I don't buy Porsche lol"". Others thought that it was just a promotional strategy that was ""well conducted"". It was also suggested that the company had been ""irresponsible"" and should have honoured the cut-price offer. Another social media user claimed to be the first person to try to buy the car but had cancelled their order when they were told the real price. They said it would have been wrong to try to take advantage of a mistake. Porsche started selling cars in mainland China more than 20 years ago. In recent years the company expanded its footprint in the world's second largest economy as it opened new dealerships. The country is now Porsche's largest single market globally, with sales totalling $6.2bn in the first six months of last year. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64507453
Cost of living: Car insurance pushed up by paint and energy prices,"Rising paint prices and higher energy costs were among the reasons for a leap in the cost of motor insurance late last year, a trade body has said. The average price paid for cover rose by 8% in the final three months of the year, compared with the previous quarter, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) said. The typical premium of £470 was up 7% on the last three months of 2021. Repair and courtesy car costs were factors in the increase, the ABI said. The rise in the cost of paint and the jump in energy prices were among the factors that made vehicle repairs cost more, the trade body said. Jonathan Fong, senior policy adviser of general insurance at the ABI, said: ""Every motorist wants the best insurance deal, especially when coping with cost-of-living pressures, and insurers continue to do all they can to keep motor insurance as competitively priced as possible. ""Yet, like many other sectors, insurers continue to face higher costs, such as more expensive raw materials, which are becoming increasingly challenging to absorb. ""Anyone concerned about being able to continue paying their motor insurance premium should speak to their insurer about any alternative payment options that may be available.""  The price paid for renewing an existing motor insurance policy was typically £428, the ABI said, whereas the average price paid for a new deal was a record high of £531. Rules introduced by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, in January are designed to ensure people who are loyal to the same insurer are not penalised for doing so. The rules state that the price paid by renewing customers for motor and home insurance is no greater than the price charged to an equivalent new customer for the equivalent policy bought through the same distribution channel, such as via an insurer, broker or price comparison website.

"Argentina unveils new 2,000-peso banknote as inflation bites","A new 2,000-peso banknote will be issued in Argentina in response to soaring inflation, the country's central bank (BCRA) has confirmed. The new note - which will be worth $11 (£9) officially - comes after consumer prices jumped by nearly 95% in the 12 months to the end of December. It marks Argentina's fastest pace of inflation since 1991. The largest current bill, the 1,000-peso note, is worth just $2.70 on the alternative markets. Writing on Twitter, the BCRA said the new note would ""commemorate the development of science and medicine in Argentina"". It will feature pioneering doctors Cecilia Grierson and Ramón Carrillo, it added - although it is not clear when the note will enter circulation. When Argentina's current currency was introduced in 1992, its value was pegged at one US dollar. But that fixed exchange rate system was abandoned after the financial crisis that engulfed the country in 2001 and 2002. Since then, the peso has lost so much of its value that one local artist uses banknotes for painting on, because they are cheaper than a canvas. Sergio Diaz, of Salta, recently painted a picture depicting Steven Spielberg's movie Jaws as a parody of Argentina's ever-increasing inflation. Argentina has seen prices rise sharply as the cost of commodities, including energy, has gone up. Soaring prices have largely been attributed to a bout of central bank money-printing, as well as the war in Ukraine. In December, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved another $6bn (£4.9bn) of bailout money for South America's second largest economy. It was the latest payout for Argentina in a 30-month programme that is expected to reach a total of $44bn. Last summer, the troubled country had three economy ministers in the space of just four weeks. In September, the central bank also raised its main rate of interest to 75% as it tried to rein in the soaring cost of living. Earlier this week, Brazil and Argentina announced plans to create a common currency that would be used to boost trade between the two countries.  The country's leaders said they needed to find ways to finance commerce without relying on US dollars - although discussions are at an early stage.

Sunderland driverless bus and HGV projects awarded £14m,"Projects to develop driverless buses, taxis and lorries around the UK have received £81m in funding. They include trials of HGVs running between car maker Nissan and parts company Vantec, and a shuttle to Sunderland's university and hospital.  Automated vehicle hubs in Solihull and Coventry, and a Cambridge self-driving taxi trial have also received funding. The GMB union, which represents bus drivers, said ""cast-iron guarantees"" were needed for the workers involved. National Secretary Andy Prendergast said: ""Plans for driverless buses still look a long way off and, from what GMB has been told, will require a human worker on board.  ""But any increased automation in any industry must come with cast iron guarantees for the workforce affected, as well impenetrable public safeguards if it wants to succeed.""  Bus drivers in Sunderland recently ended months of strike action after agreeing to a pay offer. Business Secretary Grant Shapps said self-driving vehicles ""could add tens of billions to our economy and create tens of thousands of jobs"" within a few years. ""This is a massive opportunity to drive forward our priority to grow the economy, which we are determined to seize,"" he said. The North East Automotive Alliance V-Cal project has been given £8m to trial the use of automated, zero-emission HGVs carrying car parts on both private land and public roads, where they will need to navigate traffic lights, roundabouts, security gates, bridges and other road users. A total of £6m will also be spent on a project involving Stagecoach North East and Newcastle University, among others, to test an automated, remotely supervised passenger service between Sunderland's transport interchange and the University of Sunderland City Campus and Sunderland Royal Hospital. In Edinburgh, Stagecoach and bus builder Alexander Dennis are being given £10.4m to launch a full-sized, self-driving bus service which the government believes would be a world first. There will also be projects to develop a zero-emission, self-driving HGV with supermarket chain Asda and to carry passengers and goods across Belfast's Harbour Estate on driverless shuttles. The £42m awarded by the government to the seven projects will be match-funded by industry. The companies will be expected to demonstrate the services are commercially sustainable by 2025.

British Gas admits agents break into struggling customers' homes,"The boss of British Gas owner Centrica has said he is horrified that debt collectors have broken into customers' homes to fit prepayment energy meters. The Times found debt agents working for British Gas expressed excitement at putting these meters in the homes of vulnerable people behind on bills. ""This happened when people were acting on behalf of British Gas. There is nothing that can be said to excuse it,"" Chris O'Shea told the BBC. The firm will stop such installations. The suspension follows an undercover investigation by the Times whose reporter went with agents working for Arvato Financial Solutions - a company used by British Gas to pursue debts - to the home of a single father with three children.  After establishing the property was unoccupied, the reporter observed the agents work with a locksmith to force their way in and install a prepayment meter. The debt agent is reported to have said: ""This is the exciting bit. I love this bit."" Mr O'Shea told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The contractor that we've employed, Arvato, has let us down but I am accountable for this. ""This happened when people were acting on behalf of British Gas. There is nothing that can be said to excuse it."" Others who experienced similar treatment, according to materials seen by The Times, include a mother whose daughter is disabled and a woman described as having mobility problems. Centrica said the suspension - where it applied to the court for a warrant to install a pre-payment meter - would last ""until at least after winter"" and that protecting vulnerable people was its priority. Business Secretary Grant Shapps said he was ""horrified"" by the findings. ""Switching customers - and particularly those who are vulnerable - to prepayment meters should only ever be a last resort and every other possible alternative should be exhausted,"" he said. ""These findings suggest British Gas are doing anything but this."" Energy firms are required to have exhausted all other options before installing a prepayment meter, and should not do so for those ""in the most vulnerable situations"". It comes amid the rising cost of living and as household bills soar in part due to mounting energy costs. Mr Shapps said the energy minister would hold a meeting with British Gas ""in the coming days"", adding: ""He will be demanding answers to ensure this systemic failure is addressed.""  A spokesperson for energy regulator Ofgem said: ""We are launching an urgent investigation into British Gas and we won't hesitate to take firm enforcement action.  ""It is unacceptable for any supplier to impose forced installations on vulnerable customers struggling to pay their bills before all other options have been exhausted and without carrying out thorough checks to ensure it is safe and practicable to do so."" There are three types of prepayment meters - key meters, smart card meters and smart prepayment meters. The first two work in a very similar way. Prepayment meters require customers to pay for their energy use in advance, either through accounts or by adding credit to a card in a convenience store or Post Office. Strict rules also apply that prevent energy suppliers moving an at-risk customer onto a prepayment meter if they are struggling to pay. Having a prepayment meter is a more expensive method of paying than by direct debit, but is sometimes the only option for people who have struggled to pay and are in debt to an energy supplier.  Many rented properties also have prepayment meters. Problems can arise when residents no longer have any credit left on the meter and have no money to top it up - leaving them unable to cook or heat their homes. Customers who are behind on their energy bills can be moved to a more expensive prepayment meter. This can be done remotely on a smart meter, or physically after the firm has been given a warrant to do so. The BBC has contacted other energy suppliers to ask if they are suspending prepayment meter installations under warrants, following the British Gas revelations. Utilita, which is a specialist prepayment energy supplier and has the majority of its 827,000 customers on smart meters, said it had suspended installing physical prepayment meters under warrants. Another supplier, So Energy, said it had not ""force-fitted"" a physical prepayment meter under warrant. It added it had never switched a smart meter remotely from credit to prepay without the customer's knowledge or consent. It said if it were to fit prepayment meters under warrant in the future, it would ""share our approach with Ofgem beforehand"". The BBC understands that Ofgem is holding talks with all suppliers following the Times' investigation. Last month, the Citizens Advice charity called for a ban on energy companies ""forcing"" customers onto prepayment meters because they are struggling to pay bills. In response to The Times, Gillian Cooper, head of energy policy at Citizens Advice, said: ""It's truly shocking to see the extent of bad practices amongst some energy suppliers.  ""Our frontline advisers know only too well the desperate situations so many struggling customers have found themselves in. Time and time again we have called for a ban on forced prepayment meter installations until new protections for customers are brought in."" Energy UK, which represents suppliers, has said there are situations - when people do not pay and are not vulnerable - that justify forced prepayment switching. Otherwise, bad debts would build up and have to be funded by increasing everyone else's bill. In a row played out in front of MPs on Tuesday, it said it was ""Ofgem's job to enforce"" when suppliers failed. However, Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem, said there was a ""deep problem with culture and approach"" if suppliers did not ensure they were treating customers properly. ""Step one for a chief executive is that they make sure they are looking after their customers,"" he said. BBC News has contacted Arvato Financial Solutions for comment.

Cost of living: Welsh Water bill is the second highest,"Welsh Water customers will see a £14 rise in their water bills for the next year, the company has announced. It brings the not-for-profit provider's average bill to £499 a year - the second highest in Wales and England. Customers of Hafren Dyfrdwy in north east Wales will see average bills rise by £41 to £372 a year. The average household in Wales and England will see bills go up by £31, the biggest increase in nearly 20 years.  Watchdog the Consumer Council for Water (CCW) warned the rise would squeeze struggling households, with one in five already finding it difficult to pay.  It said customers who cannot afford their bill must not be allowed to ""slip through the net"" due to a ""postcode lottery"" of regional variations in billing. But industry body Water UK said water bills remained lower in real terms than they were a decade ago. The regulator, Ofwat, called on water companies to ""go the extra mile"" in supporting people who need help with their bills. ""I advise people to call their water company if they're struggling,"" the CCW's Lia Moutselou told BBC Radio Wales. She also encouraged customers to ask to be put on a water meter, saying it could bring savings.  ""It's quite important for companies to help us when we miss a payment to be proactive when they see us going into debt,"" she added. Welsh Water said the increase was the result of inflation running at ""40-year high"".  ""We have absorbed as much of these costs as possible, we are not immune to these pressures,"" said Welsh Water's chief financial officer, Mike Davis. It is piloting a financial support scheme for customers in Rhondda Cynon Taf and Denbighshire. ""Households that qualify may receive a three month 'charge free' period, equating to a discount of around £100-£120 on the average bill,"" Welsh Water said.  Hafren Dyfrdwy said its bills remain the cheapest in the UK. ""We understand that cost of living pressures mean this is worrying time for some and we want to support as many people as possible,"" a spokesperson said.  ""We have a number of support schemes available, including our Here2help scheme, where customers can receive large reductions off their bill."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64491577
Mortgages: What happens if I miss a payment?,"The average interest rate charged by mortgage lenders is now much higher than many homeowners have been used to. So what can those struggling to make repayments do - and how must their mortgage provider help out? There are different types of mortgages - all of which have become more costly in recent months. Mortgage rates have risen and the 1.6 million people on tracker or variable deals are paying much more than a year ago.  The estimated 1.8 million homeowners coming to the end of a fixed deal this year face moving to a much higher monthly bill.  That is difficult to answer. Analysts expect Bank of England interest rates to peak at about 4.5% this summer.  For anyone on tracker deals, at least, that means higher repayments to come. Recent data indicates that rates on fixed-rate deals have fallen slightly after surging last year. House prices have also started to fall as higher interest rates put off buyers. The Nationwide Building Society says that property prices have fallen for five months in a row. However, a decade or so of ultra-low mortgage rates - which many homeowners have become accustomed to - is clearly over. There is a smaller choice, but still plenty of options depending on your circumstances. An agreement between lenders, the Treasury and regulators means people can switch to a new fixed-rate mortgage, without a new affordability test, when their current deal ends, as long as they are up to date with payments. A shortfall equivalent to two or more months' repayments means you are officially in arrears. But your lender must make reasonable attempts to reach an agreement with you. In fact, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) - which regulates mortgage lenders - has said they must treat customers fairly. Crucially, customers must contact their lender as soon as they realise they are going to struggle to make repayments - the earlier the better. Trained and experienced staff must be on hand to help. Within 15 working days of falling into arrears, your lender must: Your lender must then treat you fairly by considering any requests about changing how you pay, perhaps with lower repayments for a short period. Any arrangement you come to, the FCA points out, will be reflected on your credit file - affecting your ability to borrow money in the future - as will any missed payments. Your lender might also suggest or allow you to extend the term of the mortgage or let you pay just the interest for a certain period of time. A mortgage payment holiday enables customers to delay repayments - but not indefinitely. Lenders may offer this option, depending on individual circumstances - and not to those already in arrears - but the level of support offered during the Covid pandemic has been reduced. Again, this will show on your credit file.  The devolved governments run some mortgage-support schemes - but the criteria can be complex. Here is a guide from the government-backed Moneyhelper website. Some people may decide to sell their home and - in extreme circumstances - the lender could take court action to repossess it. Repossessions are far rarer than they used to be. There are lots of stages before a lender can take such action and the whole process takes about two years. But if you think your home is at risk, it is well worth getting free, independent debt advice. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63486782
Shell reports highest profits in 115 years,"Oil and gas giant Shell has reported record annual profits after energy prices surged last year following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Profits hit $39.9bn (£32.2bn) in 2022, double last year's total and the highest in its 115-year history. Energy firms have seen record earnings since oil and gas prices jumped following the invasion of Ukraine. It has heaped pressure on firms to pay more tax as households struggle with rising bills. Opposition parties said Shell's profits were ""outrageous"" and the government was letting energy firms ""off the hook"". They also called for the planned increase in the energy price cap due in April to be scrapped.  Energy prices had begun to climb after the end of Covid lockdowns but rose sharply in March last year after the events in Ukraine led to worries over supplies. The price of Brent crude oil reached nearly $128 a barrel following the invasion, but has since fallen back to about $83. Gas prices also spiked but have come down from their highs.  It has led to bumper profits for energy companies, but also fuelled a rise in energy bills for households and businesses.  Last year, the UK government introduced a windfall tax - called the Energy Profits Levy - on the ""extraordinary"" earnings of firms to help fund its scheme to lower gas and electricity bills. Despite the move, Shell had said it did not expect to pay any UK tax this year as it is allowed to offset decommissioning costs and investments in UK projects against any UK profits. However, on Thursday it said was due to pay $134m in UK windfall tax for 2022, and expected to pay more than $500m in 2023. This may look small compared to its profits but Shell only derives around 5% of its revenue from the UK - the rest is made and taxed in other jurisdictions. However, critics point out that Shell is a UK-headquartered company and has been paying more to its shareholders than it spends on renewable investments. The announcement has increased pressure on Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt to raise more money from oil and gas profits. A Downing Street official said they ""absolutely"" understand anger at the ""extraordinary"" profits but indicated there are no plans to increase the windfall tax. The prime minister's spokesman said questions about potential changes were ""for the chancellor"" when pressed by reporters. The government ""is ready to take action"" if falling wholesale energy costs aren't reflected in lower prices at the petrol pump, the official added without detailing specific measures. The government is currently limiting gas and electricity bills so a household using a typical amount of energy will pay £2,500 a year. However, that is still more than twice what it was before Russia's invasion, and the threshold is due to rise to £3,000 in April.   The government's windfall tax only applies to profits made from extracting UK oil and gas. The rate was originally set at 25%, but has now been increased to 35%. Oil and gas firms also pay 30% corporation tax on their profits as well as a supplementary 10% rate. Along with the new windfall tax, that takes their total tax rate to 75%. However, companies are able to reduce the amount of tax they pay by factoring in losses or spending on things like decommissioning North Sea oil platforms. It has meant that in recent years, energy giants such as BP and Shell have paid little or no tax in the UK. The annual profit figure far surpassed Shell's previous record set in 2008. The company also said it had paid out $6.3bn to its shareholders in the final three months of 2022, and that it planned another $4bn share buyback. Shell chief executive Wael Sawan said that these are ""incredibly difficult times - we are seeing inflation rampant around the world"" but that Shell was playing its part by investing in renewable technologies. Its chief financial officer Sinead Gorman added that Shell had paid $13bn in taxes globally in 2022. It had also accounted for 11% of liquified natural gas shipments into the EU, easing pressure on supplies caused by sanctions on Russia. Labour's shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband said: ""As the British people face an energy price hike of 40% in April, the government is letting the fossil fuel companies making bumper profits off the hook with their refusal to implement a proper windfall tax.  ""Labour would stop the energy price cap going up in April, because it is only right that the companies making unexpected windfall profits from the proceeds of war pay their fair share."" Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said: ""No company should be making these kind of outrageous profits out of Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine. ""They must tax the oil and gas companies properly and at the very least ensure that energy bills don't rise yet again in April."" TUC general secretary Paul Nowak called for ministers to impose a larger windfall tax, adding: ""The time for excuses is over."" He continued: ""Instead of holding down the pay of paramedics, teachers, firefighters and millions of other hard-pressed public servants, ministers should be making big oil and gas pay their fair share.""

What is happening to house prices and could there be a crash?,"House prices have fallen in recent months, with increased interest rates making mortgages more expensive and high inflation reducing people's spending power.  However, although Bank of England interest rates have gone up for the 10th time in a row, some mortgage rates have started to fall. In 2021 and for much of 2022, prices rose steeply - by about a quarter - across most of the UK.  The pace of growth was much faster than was seen during the recovery after the 2008 global financial crisis. However, figures from Nationwide and Halifax show consistent falls in the last five months.  The chart above shows that year-on-year growth is heading down towards zero.  Nationwide warned the housing market looked set to ""remain subdued"" in the coming months.  Monthly changes can be blips, but the UK's largest lender, Lloyds, is planning for an 8% fall in 2023.  In November, the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR), which advises the government on the health of the economy - predicted that house prices will drop by 9% over the next two years. Big jumps in interest rates have put pressure on the amount people can afford to borrow.  In turn that means lower offers and less demand for homes overall. The amount people can spend of their mortgage also depends on wider cost-of-living pressures, such as energy bills, wages and job security. The future of house prices depends on the economy as a whole.  The biggest immediate effect is on people who want to move. Some sellers may decide to delay putting their homes on the market. Homeowners who are considering moving may find they have less money to spend.  There were fewer property sales in 2022 than in the 12 months leading up to last summer's surge in prices, before the temporary stamp duty reduction ended. But if interest rates stay high, an increasing number of people will come off fixed-price mortgages (about 100,000 each month) to new, higher rates.  Some homeowners will find higher these monthly payments unaffordable, making them more likely to sell.  First-time buyers may find properties are more affordable, allowing them to get a foot on the ladder - assuming they can get a mortgage.  But a drop in prices can also send shudders through the finances of homeowners who are staying put.  At the most extreme, they can end up in negative equity - where the amount they have borrowed is greater than the current value of their property. With about a third of household wealth tied up in home values, falling prices can make people feel less financially secure and mean they save more than they spend.  Less spending can make an economic slowdown even worse. Arrears peaked during the 2008 financial crisis, and did not rise significantly during the pandemic, helped by lenders granting payment holidays.  Payment difficulties can lead to banks and building societies repossessing houses, although lenders try to avoid this.  More than 200,000 properties were repossessed in the five years after the 2008 crash.  As a result of Covid, repossessions were suspended between March 2020 and April 2021. In the year after they restarted, there were fewer than 4,000.  When the Bank of England raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage points to 3% on 3 November, it was the biggest single rise in the cost of borrowing since 1989. After the mini-budget, financial markets were forecasting that the Bank of England's interest rate would rise above 6% in 2023.  However, traders now expect the peak to be under 5%. You can use the mortgage calculator above to see how rate changes affect monthly repayments.  In the early 2000s property boom, 100% mortgages and cashback offers were not uncommon.  But after the 2008 financial crash, mortgage lending rules were tightened.  As a result, loans should leave more room for prices to fall before borrowers are stuck with negative equity.  Most recent borrowers have also had their ability to pay checked against interest rates even higher than the ones we're seeing at the moment.

The RBA told the BBC it has not yet set a date for when it will reveal the new five dollar note design. The decision was welcomed by Aboriginal politicians and community leaders. ""This is a massive win for the grassroots, First Nations people who have been fighting to decolonise this country,"" said Lidia Thorpe, a Greens senator and DjabWurrung Gunnai Gunditjmara woman. First Nations people lived in Australia for at least 65,000 years before British colonisation, according to recent estimates. The King became the British monarch after his mother's death in September. He is also the head of state of Australia, New Zealand and 12 other Commonwealth realms outside the United Kingdom. The role is largely ceremonial. The British monarch's portrait has appeared on at least one design in every series of Australian banknotes. However, in September Australia said the image of the new monarch would not automatically replace the Queen on its five dollar notes, and that she might be replaced by Australian figures. Much of Australia's currency already features Indigenous Australian figures and artworks.  In a 1999 referendum Australian voters chose to keep the British monarch as the country's head of state. In 2021, Australia officially changed its national anthem to remove reference to the country being ""young and free"", amid calls to recognise that its Indigenous people are the oldest civilization in the world.

Water bills to increase by most in almost 20 years from April,"Water bills are set to get the biggest increase in almost 20 years from April. The annual bill for an average household in England and Wales will hit £448, industry body Water UK has said. The 7.5% increase means customers will pay on average £31 more than last year. Consumer groups said the rise would squeeze struggling households when one in five are already finding it difficult to pay. But Water UK says the rise for most customers will be below inflation. This measure of the rate of overall price rises in the UK was 10.5% in December. Water UK also argued that the bills remained lower in real terms than they were a decade ago. It added that the increase reflected higher energy costs, with water firms using about 2% of the UK's electricity. Last year water firms were found to be regularly dumping illegal sewage into rivers in England and Wales. Sewage was discharged into rivers 400,000 times in 2020. The Liberal Democrats accused water companies of prioritising profits over protecting the environment. Water UK said on Thursday that firms had already been investing in infrastructure, and would invest a further £70bn to ""eliminate harm"" from storm overflows and increase water supplies by building new reservoirs and national water transfer schemes. It said that since the water industry was privatised, more than £190bn has been invested in improving services. It added that water companies ""are acutely aware of the impact of price rises on lower income and vulnerable customers"". ""Companies have recently increased the level of support they offer by more than £200m, which will help hundreds of thousands more households,"" it said. More than one million households already get help with water bills, and that will increase to 1.2 million, it said. Water UK's director of policy Stuart Colville said the average increase to bills worked out at about 60p a week.  ""However, we know that any increase is unwelcome, particularly at the moment,"" he said. ""Anyone with worries should contact their water company or go to supportontap.org for advice, and it's worth remembering that water companies will never cut anyone off, or make them use a prepayment meter."" But watchdog the Consumer Council for Water (CCW) said that many customers who cannot afford their bill ""slip through the net"" due to a ""postcode lottery"" of regional variations in billing. Some households could face rises significantly above the average, while other increases could be below, it said. CCW chief executive Emma Clancy said: ""Water is essential for all of us so no-one should be worried about being able to afford their bill."" She said the bill increases ""will bring more uncertainty to struggling households at a time when they can't be certain they will get the help they need"". ""We urgently need a new water affordability scheme that provides consistent support based on people's needs."" Water poverty campaigner Jess Cook at National Energy Action (NEA), said social tariffs are ""essential for low-income households"". ""Discounted water bills for those struggling to pay can stop the most vulnerable from cutting back or running up debt when they can ill afford to do so,"" she said. ""But the current postcode lottery means where you live affects what you pay and what support you receive."" She added that access to a social tariff ""should be made fairer, more consistent, and accessible to everyone who needs it, regardless of where they live.""

Adani calls off share sale after price plunges,"India's Adani Enterprises has called off its share sale after the share price plunged on Wednesday. The Adani Group's flagship company confirmed the $2.5bn (£2bn) raised from the sale would be returned to investors after shares fell 26%. The group's companies have seen more than $90bn wiped off their value since a US investment firm made fraud claims. Adani denies the allegations. Gautam Adani, the founder, has fallen out of the top 10 richest in the world. According to the Forbes real-time billionaires list, Mr Adani is now the 15th-richest person in the world, with a net worth of $74.7bn. He was third on the list last week. The billionaire runs Adani Group, one of India's biggest companies. The flagship company Adani Enterprises has operations in a wide range of industries including commodities trading, airports, utilities and renewable energy.  Last week, Hindenburg Research, a company that specialises in ""short-selling"", or betting against a company's share price in the expectation that it will fall, released a report that accused Mr Adani of ""pulling the largest con in corporate history"".  It also alleged the Adani Group had engaged in decades of ""brazen"" stock manipulation and accounting fraud, and claimed its companies had ""substantial debt"" which put the entire group on a ""precarious financial footing"". The group has dismissed the allegations as malicious and untrue, calling them an ""attack on India"". The report came days ahead of a planned sale of Adani shares to the public, and on Tuesday, the $2.5bn share sale in the group's flagship company managed to scrape through to be fully subscribed despite the controversy.  But shares plunged 26.7% on Wednesday, taking the total fall in market value for the group over $90bn, according to Bloomberg. After the market closed, Adani Group said the company would return the share sale proceeds due to ""the unprecedented situation and the current market volatility"". ""Given these extraordinary circumstances, the Company's board felt that going ahead with the issue would not be morally correct,"" said Mr Adani. ""The interest of the investors is paramount and hence to insulate them from any potential financial losses, the Board has decided not to go ahead with the FPO (follow-on public offer)."" Mr Adani said the company's balance sheet was ""very healthy with strong cashflows and secure assets"" ""We have an impeccable track record of servicing our debt,"" he added. ""This decision will not have any impact on our existing operations and future plans."" Adani Group has hit back at the allegations against it and said it was evaluating ""remedial and punitive action"" against Hindenburg Research in the US and India. It said it had always been ""in compliance with all laws"". In an interview with Mint newspaper, the group's chief financial officer compared Hindenburg Research to General Dyer, the British officer of the Bengal Army responsible for a massacre that killed hundreds of Indians in the city of Amritsar in 1919. Hindenburg responded saying the group was stoking a nationalist narrative to obfuscate the fraud allegations. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64490221
Arnold Clark customer data 'stolen in cyber attack',"Some Arnold Clark customers have been told their personal information may have been stolen in a cyber attack.  The car retailer, which sells more than 300,000 cars per year, said data that may have been stolen included bank details and ID documents. Customers were emailed on Tuesday about the UK-wide hack which happened on 23 December. The firm said they shut down their entire computer network in the early hours of Christmas Eve. The ID documents retained by the firm are normally copies of passports and driver's licences. Names, dates of birth, vehicle details, contact details and National Insurance numbers could also have been targeted. Arnold Clark, which has its headquarters in Glasgow, has almost 200 dealerships across Scotland and England. It has not said how many customers have been contacted.  Those affected have been offered a two-year subscription to an identity fraud checking service because the hack puts them at a higher risk of being victims of the crime. A letter to customers from chief executive Eddie Hawthorne and chief operating office Russell Borrie said investigations were continuing.  ""Upon advice from our cyber security team, we understand that some personal data has been extracted by the hackers who carried out the cyber attack,"" it said.  ""We take the protection of your personal data extremely seriously, and we want to assure you that we are doing everything we can to minimise any risk to you from this incident."" Arnold Clark has begun rebuilding its computer infrastructure to create a ""segregated environment"", which prevents hackers who successfully breach one part of the network from being able to access other parts of the company's systems. Paul Graham, a customer from Clydebank, told BBC Scotland he was angry that he was not told about the data breach for more than a month. ""I just find it outrageous,"" he said. ""No one mentioned when I went into the dealership last week."" He complained that there was no way to speak directly to Arnold Clark about the cyber attack, and that the dedicated helpline set up for affected customers was being managed by credit protection company Experian.  Mr Graham added: ""I think it is absolutely dreadful, especially when you think 'what have they got?' It could be enough to take over my whole identity - it's frightening."" Other customers have contacted the company via social media, complaining of a potential General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) breach.  Under GDPR legislation, which allows a maximum fine of £17.5m, companies ""must inform affected individuals without undue delay"". A statement from Arnold Clark said: ""While we were initially advised that all our data was secure, unfortunately, in the course of our investigation, it has become clear that during this incident, the attackers were able to steal copies of some data that we hold."" It added: ""During this incident we have been in constant communication with the regulatory authorities and have sought useful guidance from the police, and we will continue to do so to help other companies learn from our experience and be better prepared for possible situations such as this."" The company was set up by the late Sir Arnold Clark, who opened his first showroom in Glasgow's Park Road in 1954. He was knighted in 2004 and confirmed as Britain's first billionaire car dealer in the Sunday Times Rich List in 2016, before his death in 2017. The company now has 193 dealerships and is thought to be Europe's largest independent family-run car company. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-64488013
Eastern Powerhouse: MPs call for region potential to be realised,"A group of MPs is appealing to the prime minister to help the East of England ""realise its full potential"". A letter, signed by 20 Tory MPs, called for an ""independent economic review"" for the so-called Eastern Powerhouse. It comes as a parliamentary debate heard how the region was one of the worst-funded areas of the UK, despite receiving £250m of levelling-up money. Matt Warman MP said the region had ""a unique and unrivalled combination of assets and opportunities"". The letter, from the Eastern Powerhouse group of business leaders and MPs, called on the government to take measures that could see the East deliver an £31.2bn of economic growth and some £11bn in additional tax revenue.  It also said transport spending in the East was ""just £678 per head, compared with £1,476 per head in London, and it currently sits below the UK average of £737"". It asked for ""a co-ordinated approach that researches, recognises, and advances the ideas and policies required for growth that would help this vital part of the country to flourish"".  The letter comes after a parliamentary debate on Tuesday in which several of the region's MPs spoke of how the East was still losing out when it came to spending on infrastructure and transport. The former home secretary and MP for Witham in Essex, Priti Patel, described the A12 and A120 as ""roads from the dark ages"". Peter Aldous, MP for Waveney in Suffolk, called for a ""fairer funding formula"" for education. Mr Aldous, co-chairman of the East of England parliamentary group, said: ""There is a worry that there is a lack of understanding in Whitehall of the challenges facing the region. ""There is a view that East Anglia is comfortably off, but it also has pockets of severe deprivation"". He said progress was being made on encouraging research and development, and creating jobs, but there was still concern about transport, education and training. Long-awaited work on upgrading rail junctions at Ely in Cambridgeshire and Haughley in Suffolk needed to go ahead, he said, and there must be a fairer funding formula for education, particularly in Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Central Bedfordshire. Clacton MP, Giles Watling, also told the debate it was unacceptable that a journey to London by train from his Essex constituency could take 90 minutes, while James Wild, MP for North West Norfolk, said digital connectivity was vital in rural areas.  The Levelling Up minister Dehenna Davison praised the economic success of the region but accepted ""that we need to share its assets more fairly... there is always more to do"". Mr Warman, Conservative MP for Boston and Skegness in Lincolnshire, who co-ordinated the letter to PM Rishi Sunak, said: ""From Lincolnshire to Essex, the East has a unique and unrivalled combination of assets and opportunities.  ""The government's focus on maximising every area's potential could see the East deliver more for everyone who lives there and more tax revenue to fund vital public services.""  Phillip Blond, director of the Eastern Powerhouse group, said: ""The problems that limit and constrain growth - skills, infrastructure, energy and investment - are often beyond the reach of many places to solve.  ""The East of England is an area full of economic potential and activity that can go to scale with the right regional vision and approach.""

Ipswich business group begins new bid for city status,"A new campaign by a business group to get city status for Ipswich has begun. Ipswich Central has started an engagement project, declaring ""it's time for an upgrade"".  The town did seek to become a city as part of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, but later pulled out of the race. The group said the project was about ""gathering evidence"" to present a case to the local council, so it could be prepared for when the next round of city bids begins. No new city status competitions have been announced by the government.  There are currently 55 cities in England. If granted, Ipswich would become the first city in Suffolk.  During the last city bid in 2021, Ipswich MP Tom Hunt objected, saying his constituents did not support it. Ipswich Central chief executive Sophie Alexander-Parker said the engagement project needed to include views from people across the town.  She said: ""This is about gathering the evidence, building the narrative and being able to present a case of support for city status."" Ipswich Central ""fully supports Ipswich Borough Council in submitting a bid if and when the time comes again"", she said.  The group has written to the council's leader in support of a bid being developed.  Ipswich has ""so much to put on show"" and has a lot to offer residents, visitors and businesses, Ms Alexander-Parker said. She said: ""Ipswich is the hub of Suffolk and East of England - the place where digital and other skills are grown, we must harness this."" Central Suffolk and North Ipswich MP, Dr Dan Poulter, told the BBC he was ""fully supportive"" of the campaign. A spokesperson for Ipswich Borough Council said they believed the town ""deserves to be a city"".  ""We are bigger and have better facilities than many other towns that have become cities and Suffolk is looking increasingly isolated as one of the few counties without a city,"" they said. The authority said it welcomed Ipswich Central's ""efforts to promote the benefits of city status"" and hoped it would create support for any future city bid.

HSBC staff get a uniform of jumpsuits and jeans,"HSBC has become the latest big company to announce a shift to more casual uniforms for 4,000 branch staff. The new range includes jumpsuits and ""menopause-friendly"" garments for women, ethnic-wear, including tunics and hijabs, and chinos and jeans.   Last month, British Airways unveiled its first new uniform for 20 years, including a jumpsuit for female ground staff and cabin crew.  HSBC is to close 114 more UK branches from April, with about 100 jobs going.   The bank said the uniform re-design mirrored the ""more casual new look of the banks' branches"". HSBC UK's director of distribution, Jackie Uhi, said the days of ""bowler-hatted bankers and intimidating bank branches with rows of screens"" was over.  ""The modern day banker is still smart and professional but much more casual and approachable,"" she said.  ""Our branch colleagues are the public face of the bank, so what they wear does not only need to reflect the brand, it needs to look good, be practical, comfortable and hard-wearing, while taking into account specific human needs like those who are pregnant or going through the menopause."" The bank said the fit, style and material of the new outfits had been designed to provide ""maximum comfort"" when people were experiencing menopause symptoms.  They include a fit-and-flare shape jersey dress, V-neck tunic, tailored jumpsuit, jersey tees and a chino knee-length skirt.   It comes after Virgin Atlantic announced last year that it was taking a ""fluid approach"" to uniforms which allowed staff to choose their clothing ""no matter their gender"". The airline will allow male pilots and crew to wear skirts and female colleagues to choose trousers. Meanwhile BA plans to roll out its revamped uniforms, designed by Ozwald Boateng, for 30,000 staff this spring.  Initially its jumpsuit will be for female ground staff but is set to be made available to cabin crew after further trials. The new BA uniform also includes a tunic and hijab option. HSBC's said its new uniforms, which took two years to develop, were its ""most sustainable"" yet. They are made from recycled polyester, dissolving plastic, ocean recovered plastic and sustainable cotton.  The unveiling comes months before HSBC begins another round of bank branch closures in the UK, shutting 114 sites. It will leave the lender with 327 outlets. The bank has previously said banking remotely was becoming the norm for ""the vast majority of us"" and the number of people using banks was at an ""all-time low"". It has said it would try to redeploy affected staff, but about 100 would still lose their jobs.   ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64484761
Brexit's a complete disaster for trade - Shropshire business owner,"Three years on since the UK left the European Union (EU), a Midlands business owner has described the move as a ""complete disaster"".  Nic Laurens, who runs an abrasives supply firm in Shropshire, moved 90% of his company to the Republic of Ireland in order to remain in the EU. Higher costs and piles of paperwork to export goods left customers with four-week waits for orders, he said. The government has previously said trade with the EU was ""rebounding"". It said recent data showed ""trade to both EU and non-EU countries is above pre-Covid levels"". However, Mr Laurens, a former Conservative councillor, said Brexit had left his firm facing filling out 24 forms to export goods into the EU. ""Brexit has [caused] barriers to trade and additional costs that you have to pass on to the consumer,"" he told the BBC. ""We've had to completely rethink our business model. ""The UK hasn't grown, it has stagnated, but the Irish side of the business has gone from strength to strength."" All of the products at his company, Severn Diamond Tools and Abrasives, are manufactured abroad. ""We never ship anything from the UK to Ireland anymore. The last time we did, it took four weeks for a parcel to arrive to the customer. Before Brexit it used to take three days,"" Mr Laurens said. ""As a business, we have no plans to invest in the UK market because of the uncertainty around the government."" Nationally, when the British Chambers of Commerce surveyed 500 firms, more than half of them said they were still grappling with the rules for trading within the Union. The red tape may have deterred some small exporters altogether. A study of customs classifications shows the variety of goods British businesses export has diminished. Leaving the EU also meant changes to the rules on the free movement of labour and the introduction of a points-based immigration system that has prompted complaints from some unlikely quarters. Shamim Husein-Miya, the business director of Five Rivers Restaurant, said the Walsall firm had had to adapt the way it recruited staff. ""As a business, we looked at overseas recruitment for many years before Brexit, but now it has been more challenging."" However, as many around the country struggle to cope with the rising cost-of-living, the restaurateur said it had boosted staffing levels, with many people now seeking second jobs and other means of income. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted the UK economy will shrink and perform worse than other advanced economies, including Russia, as the cost of living continues to hit households. The IMF forecasts the UK economy will contract by 0.6% in 2023, rather than grow slightly as previously predicted. However, the IMF also said it thought the UK was now ""on the right track"". The UK government has previously said Brexit ""opens new opportunities for UK businesses"".  Speaking in December, it said: ""Despite difficult global economic headwinds, UK-EU trade is rebounding, with recent data showing that UK trade to both EU and non-EU countries is above pre-Covid levels,""  adding exporters had been provided with ""practical support"" with post-Brexit trading arrangements. ""We've also removed 400 trade barriers across 70 countries in the past two years, removed tariffs on £30bn worth of goods and cut £1bn business costs arising from current retained EU law,"" a spokesperson added.

Elon Musk's Tesla lost $140m on Bitcoin in 2022,"Tesla made a $140m (£113.5m) loss on its Bitcoin investments in 2022, according to filings. The electric car maker told the US regulator it lost $204m on Bitcoin overall, though it gained back $64m through trading. Tesla put $1.5bn into Bitcoin in early 2021, with chief executive Elon Musk saying it would be accepted as payment. It changed course a few weeks later, and Tesla has since sold most of its Bitcoin holdings. It now holds about $184m of Bitcoin. Mr Musk has been among the most high-profile champions of cryptocurrency, with his pronouncements on social media often driving significant trading activity. Tesla's February 2021 Bitcoin purchase caused the cryptocurrency to rise in price by more than 25% to $48,000 - a record high at the time. It rose again in March 2021, when Mr Musk tweeted Tesla would allow customers to make their car purchases using Bitcoin. This enabled people in the US to secure orders with the equivalent of a $100 deposit in Bitcoin. But the cryptocurrency subsequently fell by more than 10% two months later, when the firm backpedalled on this plan, citing climate change concerns. According to the UK Treasury, Bitcoin's global annual energy consumption is estimated to be roughly 39% of the UK's - and some estimates put the cryptocurrency's even higher. Its price soared to almost $70,000 in November 2022 before crashing by more than 50% when Tesla decided to offload most of its holdings. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64428257
House prices fall for fifth month in a row,"House prices in the UK fell for the fifth month in a row in January, according to Nationwide Building Society. The price of the average property last month was £258,297, down by 0.6% on December.  Annual house price growth slowed to 1.1%, down from 2.8% in December. The country's biggest building society said it would be ""hard for the market to regain much momentum in the near term."" Robert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide, said ""economic headwinds are set to remain strong"", as rising prices continue eating into household budgets. He added that the affordability of mortgages would ""remain challenging"" in the short term due to higher interest rates, while saving for a deposit was ""proving a struggle for many given the rising cost of living"".   On Tuesday, the Bank of England reported lenders had approved fewer mortgages than expected in December, about 35,000 compared with more than 46,000 in November. That is the lowest number since January 2009, excluding the pandemic lockdowns. Nationwide said the decline in approvals followed a big slowdown in mortgage applications following the government's mini-budget in September. However, it said there were signs mortgage rates were slowly starting to improve.  ""Longer-term interest rates have started to edge down and should we see that continue, that should feed into lower mortgage prices and provide some easing in the affordability pressures,"" its senior economist Andrew Harvey told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mortgage rates rose throughout last year as the Bank of England put up interest rates to tackle the soaring cost of living.  But they spiked above 6%  - their highest level for 14 years - after Liz Truss's mini-budget sparked panic on financial markets.   Since then markets have calmed and mortgage rates have fallen back somewhat, but they remain much higher than a year ago.  Gabriella Dickens, a senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""Nationwide's data show that house prices are continuing to buckle under the pressure of elevated mortgage rates, squeezed real incomes and weak consumers' confidence."" And while annual house prices are still rising, albeit more slowly than before, Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, said the UK housing market was ""headed for an annual fall in prices as mortgage rates remain notably higher than 12 months ago"". ""We expect prices to decline 10% over the next two years as budgets get recalculated."" Nationwide's latest figures suggest mortgages are less affordable in all regions compared with 2021, with the cost of servicing the typical mortgage as a share of take-home pay at or above the long-run average. London and the south of England face the biggest ""affordability pressures"", with Scotland and the North remaining the most affordable regions, but mortgage payments there as a share of take-home pay are still at their highest level for more than a decade.  Caution abounds in the housing market at present. Sellers may price down if they really need to secure a purchase. Would-be buyers, aware of predictions of further house price falls, may be delaying any decision to make a move. First-time buyers who would usually welcome dropping prices are having to contend with mortgage rates higher than they might have expected. The cost of living could also be hampering their ability to save for a deposit. But - as the Nationwide acknowledges - the UK housing market is made up of often very different regions and neighbourhoods. Individual circumstances and local dynamics can be just as important as the wider economic picture. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64471258
Bill Gates would rather pay for vaccines than travel to Mars,"Billionaire Bill Gates has said he would rather pay for vaccines than travelling to Mars, which he does not think is a good use of money. ""It's actually quite expensive to go to Mars. You can buy measles vaccines and save lives for $1,000 (£814) per life saved,"" he told the BBC.  ""And so [that] just kind of grounds you, as in - don't go to Mars.""  Fellow entrepreneur Elon Musk has said he wants to colonise Mars, while Jeff Bezos has also joined the ""space race"". SpaceX, the rocket company co-founded by Mr Musk in 2002, has made it an ultimate goal to send crewed flights to Mars and eventually colonise the Red Planet.  Mr Bezos, the founder of Amazon, heads the aerospace company Blue Origin and made a short journey to space in 2021, while British tycoon Sir Richard Branson has also reached the edge of space on his Virgin Galactic rocket plane. Mr Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, also believes artificial intelligence will  ""pretty dramatically"" transform humanity. He said: ""It will help us look into medical and scientific questions. It's not just robots, it's helping to read and write as well.  ""In fact, there's been more progress there than on the robotic side. Both of them will give us much higher productivity."" Mr Gates also spoke of his surprise at becoming the face of conspiracy theories during the Covid-19 pandemic. ""I did not expect that,"" he said, referring to suggestions he profited from the virus, or started it himself.  ""During the pandemic, there were tens of millions of messages that I intentionally caused it, or I'm tracking people. It's true I'm involved with vaccines, but I'm involved with vaccines to save lives. ""These messages sort of inverted that. I guess people are looking for the 'boogeyman' behind the curtain, the over-simplistic explanation. Malevolence is a lot easier to understand than biology."" Mr Gates also spoke about how he, like many other philanthropists, met sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein. ""I'm certainly more careful now than back when I did that. I'll do a little more due diligence. I may make a mistake again. I'm out in the world and I'm not trying to be a recluse."" Mr Gates, who has spent much of his life as the richest person in the world, has given tens of billions of pounds to philanthropic causes, often targeted at global health, especially children.   He now divides his time between climate change, and eradicating malnutrition and diseases such as polio and malaria. On the question of whether he is frugal in his personal life, Mr Gates said: ""I don't have a gigantic closet. I don't wear jewellery. When I'm unwrapping a present, I don't take the wrapping and fold it up and use it again. My grandmother never threw a paper bag in her life or any string on a package. So by her standards, I'm crazy."" Mr Gates divorced his wife, Melinda, in May 2021. When asked if he would like to find love again, he said: ""Sure, I'm not a robot.""

How we fell out of love with voice assistants,"To begin with, Abigail Barnes loved her voice assistant. Now it lives in the drawer.  ""I used [my Amazon Alexa] to turn on the lights or set a timer, and as a speaker for books and podcasts,"" says the 43-year-old Londoner. ""She turned my fan on and off during the heatwave and played me Christmas music in the winter."" Ms Barnes would ask her device to set alarms, tell her the time or for the weather forecast.  ""I kept my first Alexa in the kitchen and, a few months later, I got a second Alexa and set it up in my bedroom."" However, Ms Barnes fell out of love with her voice assistants when they began giving her frequent delivery notifications, asking her to review purchases or prompting her to reorder items. ""It started giving me random updates or asking me to rate a product I'd bought last month,"" she says, ""which I found really irritating."" She became concerned about conversation data ""being stored in a cloud somewhere"". Then she found the voice commands became unreliable. ""I stopped asking her to turn off the lights when I went to bed, as I'd ask a number of times and then manually turn them off anyway."" What started out saving her time, she says, quickly became something that cost time.  The Internet of Things (IoT) - the ever-growing network of physical objects connected to the internet - is increasingly becoming embedded in our lives.  There is a wide range of smart devices on the market from light bulbs, ovens and washing machines, to speakers, fitness trackers, toothbrushes and baby changing mats. Voice assistants, such as Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant and Apple's Siri, enable users to control IoT devices by voice command. It is estimated that this year, the number of voice assistants in existence will match the global population - at around eight billion.  However, after several boom years, the big tech companies are making cutbacks, with their voice assistant units in particular trouble.  More technology of business: Late last year, Amazon began cutting thousands of jobs, with reports saying that the Alexa voice assistant unit was particularly hard hit, having been on track to lose a reported $10bn (£8bn) in 2022. Google also reportedly made the decision to scale back development of its Google Assistant. Do these mounting losses and job cuts point to the downfall of the voice assistant? When Alexa launched, Amazon pioneered a new business model. The goal wasn't to make money from selling the devices themselves but for shoppers to make purchases using the voice assistant. Just a few years after launching, Amazon saw a billion interactions per week. But they were not the money-making opportunities that Amazon was hoping for. Instead, most were simple tasks like checking the weather or making a call. For the past three years voice assistant use has been falling and adoption continues to slow. ""Voice assistants have not become as socially sticky as promised,"" says Helen Jambunathan from consumer insights agency Canvas8. ""A number of factors have fed into this, including concerns about privacy.""  According to a 2020 survey, 82% of people are worried about monitoring by phone microphones, laptop webcams and voice assistants. Reports of Amazon Alexa sending voice recordings to the wrong person and employees listening to private conversations only add to this concern. ""Voice assistants have never shaken connotations of invasion and intrusion,"" says Ms Jambunathan. ""There have also been several high-profile instances of voice assistants being creepy, racist and giving dangerous advice - further eroding consumer trust."" Add the cost-of-living crisis to this, she continues, and voice assistants have become a luxury item ""unable to compete with other aspirational luxury or tech purchases"". However, while voice assistants may be losing their appeal for general use, in healthcare they are on the rise. When it comes to people with dementia, ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), sight problems and mobility challenges, Alexa is ""a game changer"", says Eric Saarnio, international business lead for Amazon Alexa. ""Smart assistants are evolving - it's early days,"" he says. ""We've come a long way over the past eight years and we're certainly not stopping. What we're doing can change people's lives."" Majesticare provides residential, nursing and dementia care, and is one of the UK's first care groups to introduce Alexa Smart Properties for Senior Living into their homes. ""It's just amazing to walk into a resident's room and know that they are listening to music they have chosen, or catching up on their favourite radio shows,"" says Angela Boxall, CEO of Majesticare. Residents are able to connect with family and friends. They can ask for a drink, find out what's on the menu, or ask what activities are planned that day - simply by talking.  ""Video calls with loved ones bring peace of mind,"" says Ms Boxall, ""and [the residents have such] wonderful smiles when they see the ones they cherish."" While voice assistants might have found a useful niche in healthcare, their appeal in the broader market may be on the wane. Abigail Barnes's Alexa won't be seeing daylight again any time soon. ""I do miss her,"" she says. ""I may revisit her, but [if I do] I'll invest time in looking into the notification settings, and reading the terms and conditions.""

Mobile phone service outage affects Channel Islands,"Mobile phone and broadband issues have been reported across the Channel Islands, affecting connectivity. The issues started at about 16:00 GMT and lasted about an hour. Sure's Group CEO Alistair Beak said the outage was a result of a ""network configuration error"" and apologised for the inconvenience. Airtel, whose customers were impacted as it is provided some services by Sure, said any users still experiencing an issue should restart their device. During the outage Sure said calls, data and text messages were affected, but calls to 999 from a mobile were working.  Mr Beak said a full review would be conducted into the incident.  He said: ""We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused by the outage. We're proud of our network resilience and thankfully this a rare occurrence.""

Coventry and Solihull awarded £15m for driverless shuttles,"A project developing driverless shuttles in Coventry and Solihull has received £15.2m in funding. The grant, from government and industry, is to establish passenger routes between Coventry railway station and the city's university campus. Shuttles are also hoped to run between Birmingham International station, Birmingham Business Park and the NEC.  ""The city and region is really leading the way here,"" said Coventry councillor Jim O'Boyle. ""This is an emerging sector which will create jobs and opportunities for local people, supporting the economic success of the city,"" he added. Solihull council leader Ian Courts said automated shuttle trials had already been carried out ""safely"" in the borough. ""However, this next step will help develop our understanding around the commercial viability of self-driving operations,"" he added. The proposed routes, which will be served by 13 vehicles, are being developed by a regional consortium led by driverless vehicle company Conigital. A remote operating centre, run by Transport for West Midlands, will monitor the vehicles using 5G technology and take control if necessary. Coventry City Council said the technology would be transferable to all vehicles including the ""very light"" railway scheme in development. It hoped to demonstrate vehicles toward the end of a two-year time frame, the authority added. West Midlands mayor Andy Street said the latest funding announcement was ""yet another huge vote of confidence"" in the region. Conigital CEO Don Dhaliwal said the Multi-Area Connected Automated Mobility (MACAM) project would create ""a safer and cleaner and more climate conscious future"". The government has awarded £42m to automated vehicle projects across the country, a sum matched by private industry. A slice of £8.3m has been set aside for the MACAM project, which is also supported by the NEC, Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council and the West Midlands Combined Authority. Other partners include Direct Line Group, the University of Warwick, Coventry University, dRisk and IPG Automotive. Birmingham is also set to get a portion of £600,000 for feasibility studies to look at potential routes where automated vehicles might operate exclusively. Business Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""In just a few years' time, the business of self-driving vehicles could add tens of billions to our economy and create tens of thousands of jobs."" Forecasts predicted that by 2035, 40% of new UK car sales would have self-driving capabilities, the government said. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

"Iran blames Israel for Isfahan drone attack, warning of revenge","Iran has blamed Israel for a drone attack on a military site in the central city of Isfahan on Saturday. Its ambassador to the UN said findings indicated Israel ""was responsible for this attempted act of aggression"". Iran, he said, reserves the right ""to respond resolutely to any threats or wrongful actions"" by Israel. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied it was behind the attack, which Iran said caused minor damage, though this has not been independently verified. The two countries are arch-foes and in recent years have been engaged in what has been described as a ""shadow war"" of unclaimed attacks on each other's assets, infrastructure and nationals. Israel is mostly known to have carried out strikes on what it says are Iranian weapons transfers to militants in Lebanon and is also believed to have sabotaged Iran's nuclear sites and killed Iranian nuclear scientists. Iran, which rejects Israel's right to exist, has been accused by Israel of attacking and planning to attack Israeli and Jewish targets and people. Each side is also believed to have attacked the other's shipping. In a letter to the UN secretary general, Iranian ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani accused Israel of ""an attempt... to launch a terrorist attack against a workshop complex"" belonging to Iran's defence ministry. He did not specify what evidence Iran had for this. Mr Iravani said Iran reserved the right to respond ""wherever and whenever deemed necessary"". The purpose of the attacked site is unclear, though reports suggest it could be connected to missile production. US media have quoted unnamed US officials as saying Israel carried out the attack, which Iran said involved three drones, on Saturday night at about 23:30 (20:00 GMT). Iran said one was destroyed by air defence systems and two were caught by ""defence traps"", causing minor damage to a building and no casualties. If confirmed it would mark the first such known attack on a facility in Iran under the current Israeli government which came to power under Benjamin Netanyahu at the end of December. In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Mr Netanyahu said Israel had been ""taking action against certain weapons development"" in Iran, but neither confirmed nor denied it had attacked the site in Isfahan.  ""I never talk about specific operations… and every time some explosion takes place in the Middle East, Israel is blamed or given responsibility - sometimes we are sometimes we're not,"" he said.

Mascara: What is the TikTok trend all about?,"TikTok fan? Chances are you've seen a lot of people talking about mascara recently - but it isn't about make-up. People have been using the word to talk about relationships in a way that avoids TikTok's censorship filters.  Since the #mascara trend originated less than two weeks ago, it's racked up more than 100 million views.   The secret code started off confusing, then took a darker turn that got actress Julia Fox into a bit of trouble. But what is it all about? In the beginning the mascara trend was fairly wholesome. Users would post videos - usually with the song Constellations, by Duster - and talk about their experiences, good and bad, with partners.   One said they have had their mascara since they were 14, and ""there's nothing like this one anywhere else"".  Some weren't so lucky in love. Another said they didn't know if they would ""ever trust any other mascara"" after theirs ""made my lashes completely fall apart"".  Like so many trends, it soon grew more sexual. Mascara, and the mascara wand, soon became code words for a certain body part. Some people even discussed their wand sizes, or how long their mascara lasted.   Then along came discussions of sexual assault and trauma, framed in a way that only those ""in the know"" would understand. More than a few people complained it was more than a little confusing. This confusion landed actress and model Julia Fox in hot water last week when she replied to a video that used this alternative meaning.  The user posted that his mascara was tried ""without my consent"". Julia responded: ""Idk why but I don't feel bad for u lol"".   People were quick to call her out on the comment.  She apologised once she realised her mistake, saying she genuinely thought they were talking about make-up. Code words are common on TikTok, and words like grape - rape - and unalive - suicide - are used constantly.   They're all a response to the app's ban on sexually explicit language and content, which can make it hard to talk about sensitive topics.   This language that develops out of tight regulations was given the name ""Algospeak"" - algorithm speak - by Taylor Lorenz, a Washington Post reporter.   Code words aren't a new thing online. There was a time when most people didn't know what OMG, LOL or IKR meant. And if you're ""in the know"", there's not much room for confusion. As one user wrote: ""As much as I hate terms like 'unalive' there is no mistaking what that term means. If you say SA, I either know it means sexual assault or I can Google it and find it."" But they pointed out a specific problem with the #mascaratrend.   ""If I Google mascara, all I'll get is actual mascara because make-up companies pay big money for first-page ad space.""  Trauma expert Danny Greeves thinks that TikTok is a poor medium to share traumatic experiences appropriately.  Danny says code words present a ""challenge"" because they reference a topic indirectly and take away its ""emotional significance"". ""Topics that would usually command empathy, understanding and sensitivity become trivialised. ""When that occurs - such as with the mascara trend - deeply painful and traumatic events such as sexual assault are minimised."" Educational and child psychologist Dr Amanda Furness isn't quite as convinced, and says the developing language might allow young people to discuss experiences more openly. ""But it does give a confusing message and is open to misinterpretation,"" she says. In her view, ""the most helpful place to start is ensuring that young people feel comfortable and safe talking about their experiences and bodies in a universally understood way"". And she reminds everyone to remember that when you share on social media, you can't control where the information ends up.

Crypto theft: North Korea-linked hackers stole $1.7b in 2022,"North Korea-backed hackers stole $1.7bn (£1.4bn) of crypto in 2022, says blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. This nearly quadruples the country's previous record for cryptocurrency theft - $429m in 2021. The loot also made up 44% of the $3.8bn stolen in crypto hacks last year, which the firm called ""the biggest year ever for crypto hacking"". Experts have said the country, facing heavy sanctions, is turning to crypto theft to fund its nuclear arsenal. North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests and analysts expect the seventh one this year, as the country accelerates its nuclear weapons programme under leader Kim Jong-un. Last year, Pyongyang launched a record number of ballistic and other missiles. This is despite the country's struggling economy.  ""For context, North Korea's total exports in 2020 totalled $142m worth of goods, so it isn't a stretch to say that cryptocurrency hacking is a sizable chunk of the nation's economy,"" Chainalysis said in a report on Wednesday. These hackers typically launder crypto through ""mixers"", which blend cryptocurrencies from various users to obfuscate the origins of the funds, the firm said.  Other experts have also said that North Korea launders stolen crypto through brokers in China and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Last month, the FBI confirmed that North Korea-affiliated Lazarus Group was responsible for a $100m crypto heist on a blockchain network called Horizon bridge last year.  Overall, decentralised finance protocols, or DeFi, accounted for over 82% of cryptocurrency stolen in 2022, Chainalysis' report said. DeFi users know what will happen to their funds when they use them because smart contract codes governing these protocols are publicly accessible by default.  But this transparency also makes DeFi particularly attractive to hackers, who can scan the codes for vulnerabilities and ""strike at the perfect time"" to maximise their loot, according to the report.  David Schwed, chief operating officer at blockchain security firm Halborn, noted that DeFi developers ""prioritise growth over all else"", and funds that could be used to enhance security are often directed instead to rewards, in order to attract users. DeFi developers can take a leaf from traditional financial institutions in making their platforms more secure, Mr Schwed said.  For instance, they can simulate different hacking scenarios to test their protocols, or design mechanisms to pause or halt transactions when suspicious activity is detected. ""You don't need to move as slow as a bank, but you can borrow from what banks do,"" he said. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64494094
Facebook: Quarter of global population used site daily in December,"The number of people using Facebook daily grew to an average of two billion in December - about a quarter of the world's population. The bigger-than-expected growth helped drive new optimism about the company, which has been under pressure as its costs rise and advertising sales slump. Shares in parent company Meta surged more than 15% in after-hours trade as boss Mark Zuckerberg declared 2023 the ""year of efficiency"". He said he was focused on cost cuts. ""We're in a different environment now,"" he said, pointing to the firm's revenue, which declined in 2022 for the first time in its history after years of double-digit growth.  ""We don't anticipate that that's going to continue, but I also don't think it's going to go back to the way it was before."" Meta, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, announced a major restructuring last year, including reducing office space and cutting 11,000 jobs or about 13% of staff.  The firm said those moves cost it $4.6bn last year - hitting its profits, which were almost cut in half. It still brought it in $23.2bn in profit for the year. ""2022 was a challenging year but I think we ended it having made good progress,"" Mr Zuckerberg said.  In the three months to December, the firm said revenue was $32.2bn, down 4% year-on-year.  But that was better than many analysts had expected.  Meta had alarmed investors last year when it posted the first-ever decline in daily Facebook users in its history and signalled it was focusing investments on virtual reality, known as the metaverse.  But in December, the number of users on the site daily was up 4% from a year earlier, adding users even in Europe and the US and Canada.   Meta said the number of people active across all of its apps each day was up 5% year-on-year.  Mr Zuckerberg said the company was making progress with its video product - Reels - which it has been focused on as it faces off with rivals such as TikTok, which have gained traction, especially among younger users.  Mr Zuckerberg said those efforts were starting to pay off, and ad dollars were starting to follow users to the videos.  Investors seized on the company's forecast of lower costs and stronger sales than expected in the months ahead, helping send shares higher.  The company also said it would spend an extra $40bn to buy back shares, which dropped sharply last year amid investor doubts about the direction of the company.

ChatGPT firm trials $20 monthly subscription fee,"The firm behind the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT is trialling a subscription service in the US. For $20 (£16) per month, subscribers will get access to the platform even at peak times when it can be hard to log onto, and also ""priority access"" to new features, chatbot creator OpenAI said. It plans to extend the trial more widely but initially it will only be offered to those on a waiting list. The free version will still be available, the firm said. In a blog post, OpenAI said it hoped the subscription would support free access. It currently costs the firm a small amount of money every time the chatbot is used. ChatGPT provides convincingly human responses to questions using information from the internet, but it is not connected live - it uses data from the internet as it was in 2021. Within a few days of its launch, OpenAI boss Sam Altman tweeted that it had already been used more than one million times, however, the firm has not released any further data since then. The chatbot has captured people's imagination by being able to mimic a wide range of writing styles, from journalist and doctor, to rock star and student essay writer.  The musician Nick Cave described its songwriting attempts in his style as ""a grotesque mockery"". As well as being used for fun, people are asking ChatGPT to write website and marketing copy, find food recipes and write or check program code.  There are fears that pupils are already using it to do their homework, and some cyber security experts have warned that it could be manipulated into writing malicious software known as malware. On Tuesday, OpenAI launched a tool which it claims can detect whether text was written by human or artificial intelligence. Some experts believe that decent chatbots are the future of search engines - where AI searches the internet for one correct answer to a search query rather than serving up pages of links. But ChatGPT currently does not attribute information or offer any comment about its accuracy, and there are many examples of it presenting misinformation as fact.  It is also restricted to the contents of the internet as they were in 2021. The version that's been released is version three, and the company has said the next generation is currently being built. ChatGPT is known as a language learning model and many other firms are developing them. Google's is called Lamda, and was so convincing that Blake Lemoine, one of the engineers who worked on it, was convinced it was sentient.  Mr Lemoine was fired, and Google has always denied the claim. It has not released Lamda to the public. You can follow Zoe Kleinman on Twitter @zsk. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64492750
"Builth Wells man watched daughter, 5, on Alexa app from pub","A man has lost custody of his five-year-old child after using an Alexa to babysit her while he was in the pub. The 30-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, left her asleep and watched her using an Alexa app. A court heard he left his daughter in his partner's home in Builth Wells, Powys, at 20:00 on 13 August 2022. He was arrested after strangling his partner and admitted that attack and child neglect. He was given a 12-month jail sentence, suspended for two years. Llandrindod Wells Magistrates Court heard police were called when he attacked his partner after going out drinking, leaving his daughter by herself. When police arrived, he admitted leaving his daughter with an Alexa by her bed. Rebecca Ross, prosecuting, said the child lived part-time with her mother and part-time with her father. She said: ""They had been drinking vodka and gin with lemonade at home from around 8pm. The defendant's daughter was in the house but in bed. ""He wasn't going to go out but he was not chuffed when she said she was going out without him, so he went out as well."" He set up an Amazon Alexa camera to watch the child. The court heard he was meant to be in charge of caring for his daughter but instead ""went to a string of pubs"" in the town. Police were called after a neighbour heard screaming in the garden at about 02:00. PC Phillip Coombs arrived at 02:10 and said the arguing pair ""had to be separated"". The court heard the defendant told officers he grabbed the victim by the throat, told her to shut up and that she needed to calm down. Gareth Walters, defending, said his client would feel the consequences of losing his daughter for a long time. ""He felt he was keeping an eye on his daughter but he realises you can't do that remotely. ""There was some effort by him to keep an eye on her but he knows the standards fell below what is expected of a parent."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64489115
MrBeast: Why has YouTuber faced criticism for blind surgery video?,"The world's most popular YouTuber has responded to criticism following a video of him funding multiple life-changing operations. In the post, MrBeast reveals that he paid for sight-restoring cataract surgery for a thousand people. But the clip, which has over 71 million views, has divided opinion with some calling it ""charity porn"". The 24-year-old, real name Jimmy Donaldson, tweeted in response to suggestions that the video was made purely for financial gain, saying the ""average MrBeast video lost $1,500,000 last year"". He also argued the video did ""raise awareness"". MrBeast, who has 131 million subscribers and recently became the world's most popular YouTuber, initially said he did not expect so many people to view the video. As more people watched the video, there were questions and concerns over the cost and inaccessibility of eye surgery in some parts of the world. Some people also suggested rich influencers should not be used to try and fix wider problems in society and healthcare.  But not everyone agrees, with some praising for him raising awareness. Andrew Hodgson, president of the National Federation of the Blind of the UK, told BBC Newsbeat: ""Anything that puts a spotlight on such treatable eye conditions like cataracts and provides funding for people to undergo surgery to restore their sight should be welcomed. ""Why would anybody criticise this work and raising awareness of it through film and social media channels?""  A spokeswoman for Sightsavers, an international charity, added they were ""encouraged to see the subject of the global eye health burden being raised to a large public audience"". ""Eye health is often a forgotten topic when it comes to global health conversations, but eye health equals opportunity, allowing children to learn and adults to earn,"" they added. One Twitter user notes ""the fact it took charity for these people to get help highlights the problem"".  But another user said ""paying for 1000 blind people to have eye surgery is a nice thing to do, but using that act of generosity into content turns it into a tacky and tasteless act of charity porn"". Dr Jeff Levenson, the surgeon who worked on behalf of the social media star, says in the video ""half of all the blindness in the world is people who need a 10 minute surgery"".  MrBeast is known for videos featuring huge cash giveaways and prizes, as well as charity work. In 2021, he launched a separate philanthropy-themed YouTube channel, which itself has more than 10 million subscribers, and he has a licensed charity that functions as a food bank to feed communities across the US. More than two million people are living with sight loss in the UK, of which 340,000 are registered as blind or partially sighted, according to the NHS.  In the instance that an individual's quality of life is impacted by their declining sight, the NHS provides assessment and surgery if and whenever necessary.  The Royal College of Optometrists reported that in the UK just under 44,000 cataract procedures were carried out in one month alone in 2021. Despite the mixed response, MrBeast's impact on those who received surgery is visible in the emotional reaction of those he helped. ""I didn't think I was ever going to see again,"" said one patient who had previously been a cashier, but had been forced to stop working when his sight loss became so advanced.

Teen hacker Josh Maunder who crashed KSI-Logan Paul fight site sentenced,"A teenager who made a computer virus to target a celebrity boxing match and hundreds of financial institutions has been given a suspended sentence.  Josh Maunder, 19, targeted websites through a Distributed Denial of Service attack, which overloads a system with requests which are difficult to stop. Targets included Nationwide and the server hosting a boxing match between rapper KSI and YouTube star Logan Paul.  The Co Down teen was 15 when the crimes occurred between 2017 and 2018. He used a program called stress.wtf, which he created when he was 12, Belfast Crown Court heard. Maunder, of Abbey Park in Bangor, pleaded guilty to 19 computer misuse offences. The judge said that while there was no doubt Maunder was highly skilled, he described the attacks as ""malicious"" and ""unauthorised"", adding that he believed Maunder was motivated by ""online fame and kudos"" from other online hackers, gamers and YouTubers.  Handing down the sentence to Maunder, the judge said he would ""have to bear in mind you were a child when the offences were committed"".  A total sentence of 20 months, suspended for three years, was passed. PSNI Det Sgt McCarragher said Wednesday's sentencing was the result of a ""complex investigation into a vast range of cyber-attacks with a domestic and international dimension"". The PSNI said Maunder had caused a substantial loss to a financial company, numerous police public information websites, a human rights group and also had involvement in organising an orchestrated cyber-attack on a pay-per-view celebrity boxing event. ""Further to this, he was in possession of malicious software and managed an online community of peers engaged in prolific computer misuse offences which was also successfully impacted by the investigation,"" said PSNI Det Sgt McCarragher.

"Gaming: Llysfaen man gambled away £500,000 by his late 20s","A man who lost £500,000 betting has described how his gambling addiction started with gaming as a teenager. Jordan Lea, from Llysfaen, Conwy county, started placing bets at about 14, and by his late 20s, was in huge debt.  He has set up a gambling help charity that is seeing ""a huge amount"" of young people getting hooked.  Early education on problem gambling is urgently needed, Public Health Wales (PHW) said. Mr Lea said there was ""a very prominent link"" between gaming and gambling, adding: ""I actually became addicted to gambling through gaming when I was 14 or 15 years old. ""By the time I was 18, I was already primed for quite a severe gambling addiction, which led me down a [path to the] criminal justice system."" By his late 20s, his life had collapsed into debt and compulsive betting, he told BBC Radio Wales. But his life changed when a casino croupier confronted him about his problem. ""I just broke down in tears,"" he said.  ""That was the catalyst that really pushed me to get help."" He later founded Deal Me Out, an awareness and education charity on gambling and gaming-related harms in Wales. ""People call it the hidden addiction,"" he said.  ""With online gambling it's on your phone, you have a casino in your pocket. You can do that on the toilet without being seen by anyone."" He believes a ""severe lack of education"" about the dangers of gambling meant his problems went unacknowledged for years. As a support worker, his ""primary concern"" is now for young people getting hooked online ""through skin betting with crypto websites"". He said ""frontline education"" is needed for young people and their parents.  PHW said the links between gambling and gaming need to be acknowledged. It called for urgent action to tighten ""regulation of gambling industry advertising and practices"". The organisation also wants early education, more addiction support, and help from frontline health workers to identify problem gamblers and get them the help they need.  PHW's Annie Ashman said harmful gambling was having ""devastating effects"" on health and wellbeing. ""A system-wide approach is needed to take action on every level of the causes and resulting harms that gambling can have,"" she said.  ""This includes knocking down the barrier of shame and stigma, early education in schools, empowering GPs and other frontline services to identify and refer on to specialist services.""

Government promises robust crypto regulation,"The government has published proposals for crypto-asset regulation it hopes will ""manage"" the risks of the ""turbulent industry"".  The sector has had a calamitous year, with assets collapsing in value by an estimated 75% from their peak of about $3 trillion in November 2021. Ministers estimate up to 10% of UK adults now own some form of crypto. They plan to use existing regulations for the industry, rather than creating a bespoke regime. The Treasury says that will allow crypto to benefit from the ""confidence, credibility and regulatory clarity"" of the existing system for financial services, as set out in the UK's Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA). It wants to create a level playing field between traditional and emerging financial services, where the principle is ""same risk, same regulatory outcome"". But it also acknowledges some crypto businesses may simply choose to continue operating in offshore jurisdictions that ""do not impose equivalent market-abuse rules"". The Treasury says its proposals - which it's now consulting on - will: Ministers say the measures will ""mitigate the most significant risks"" of crypto technologies, while ""harnessing their advantages"".  Economic Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Griffith said the government remained ""steadfast in our commitment to grow the economy and enable technological change and innovation - and this includes crypto-asset technology"". ""But we must also protect consumers who are embracing this new technology - ensuring robust, transparent and fair standards,"" he added. Even when the crypto market was booming, in 2021, calls for regulation were loud.  After the chaos of 2022, the calls for order are now deafening. Hundreds of billions of pounds were wiped from the crypto landscape and companies and people went bankrupt thanks to scandal after scandal. The UK's plan to finally put concrete proposals in place will be welcomed by consumer investors hit in their pockets. But I expect the consultation to be fiery, with many different groups wading into the debate about how to tame the wild beast of Bitcoin and other digital coins. Part of the original appeal of cryptocurrency was its independence of traditional financial networks.  Moves to allow establishment control will infuriate a core group of true believers. But with the right form of regulation, others will argue, the industry could truly blossom.  Last year, Rishi Sunak, then Chancellor, said he wanted to make the UK ""a global hub for crypto-asset technology"". But since then, the industry worldwide has been buffeted by a series of crises - most recently, the collapse of the FTX exchange, which prosecutors have described as ""one of the biggest financial frauds in US history"".  The so-called crypto winter has raised questions about whether the industry can ever be effectively regulated.  Conservative MP Harriett Baldwin, who chairs the Treasury Committee, told BBC News it had heard evidence of ""truly Wild West behaviour"" but also recognised there was ""valuable technological innovation happening that could benefit the UK economy"". ""We are paying close attention to these plans and to the regulators' plans, because we would not want our constituents to think cryptocurrencies are any less risky if they are regulated,"" she said. Jason Guthrie, European head of digital assets at the financial firm, Wisdom Tree, said the sector had a bright future. The ""devil would be in the detail"", he told BBC News, but he ""absolutely welcomed"" regulators looking at cryptocurrency - and the right regulation would be in the interests of the industry as well as customers. ""Having a solid a regulatory framework, having enforcement capabilities, is really important for consumer confidence,"" Mr Guthrie said. ""The sooner we have details around concrete proposals, the easier it is to plan for and build towards."" Jeremy Barnett, a barrister and honorary professor of algorithmic regulation, at University College London, said the UK had much to gain, as entrepreneurs were currently choosing to set up elsewhere. ""If you don't have a proper regime, you drive people off shore,"" he said. ""I want to see people who have cryptocurrency services and products encouraged to open for business in the UK. ""We should be in this space - but it does need to be regulated and policed."" The government's consultation on its proposals will close on 30 April, with any responses then considered by ministers. Once any legislation is put to Parliament, it will be the job of the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, to draw up the detailed rules the sector will have to follow.

"Tech layoffs: PayPal cuts 2,000 jobs as global economy weakens","PayPal is shedding around 2,000 jobs, or 7% of its workers, as it becomes the latest big tech firm to cut costs. The online payments company says it was forced to make the decision as it faces ""the challenging macro-economic environment."" PayPal's announcement follows tens of thousands of layoffs by technology giants in the last month alone. This year, Google's parent company Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft have announced major job cuts. ""We must continue to change as our world, our customers, and our competitive landscape evolve,"" PayPal's chief executive Dan Schulman said in a statement. Also on Tuesday, Snap - the parent company of social media platform Snapchat - warned that revenue for the three months to the end of March could fall by as much as 10%. ""We anticipate that the operating environment will remain challenging, as we expect the headwinds we have faced over the past year to persist throughout Q1,"" the company told investors. After the announcement Snap's shares fell by almost 15% in extended trade in New York. At the start of this year, Amazon announced it planned to cut more than 18,000 jobs because of ""the uncertain economy"" and rapid hiring during the pandemic. Also this month, Alphabet said it would shed 12,000 jobs, while Microsoft said up to 10,000 employees would lose their jobs. Last week, Swedish music-streaming giant Spotify said it would cut 6% of its about 10,000 employees, citing a need to improve efficiency. In another sign of the technology industry slowdown US computer chip maker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) on Tuesday reported a 98% fall in net income for the last three months of 2022.  The company also said it expects revenue to drop by as much 10% in the current quarter. However, the figures were better than many investors had expected and AMD's shares rose after the announcement. In Asia on Wednesday, the world's second-biggest memory chip maker SK Hynix posted its largest quarterly loss on record. The South Korean company reported a worse-than-expected 1.7tn won ($1.4bn; £1.1bn) loss for the last three months of 2022, as sales fell by 38%. The firm pointed to falling computer chip prices and joined rival technology giants as it warned that it expects an industry-wide downturn to worsen in the coming months, before recovering later in the year. It came after rival Samsung Electronics on Tuesday reported its lowest quarterly profit in eight years. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64479649
World Wetlands Day: Events to be held in Alderney and Herm,"People are being invited to learn about marine life living in sunken shipwrecks as well as seals and basking sharks as part of events on Alderney and Herm. There will be a programme of activities at two Ramsar Convention areas, recognised to be wetlands of international importance. They will involve the removal of invasive species and a crab survey. The events are being held on Sunday in connection with World Wetlands Day, which was on Thursday. It marks the anniversary of the signature of the Convention of Wetlands, which took place in the Iranian city, Ramsar in 1971.  It was set up to provide the framework for national action and international cooperation for the conservation and sustainable use of wetlands. Several important habitats are present in Herm, Jethou and the Humps, including eelgrass beds, maerl beds and seven sunken shipwreck reefs, which provide spawning grounds for fish.  This site also supports flatfish, shellfish, seabirds, basking sharks, sun fish, Atlantic grey seals and four species of cetacean. Herm's event is being organised by Agriculture, Countryside and Land Management Services, the Clean Earth Trust, La Société Guernesiaise, Guernsey Conservation Volunteers and the Bailiwick Eelgrass Exploration Project. Emily Coule, Herm natural environment officer, said: ""Not only is this a celebration of wetlands, but the activities that we'll be carrying out will enable us to play our part in preserving a site of rich biodiversity."" In Alderney the wildlife trust will hold a Winter-Walkover across Platte Saline towards Hannaine Bay, involving a beach clean and the mapping of invasive species, with discussions on climate change. The Ramsar site is home to ""internationally important populations of seabirds"", a seal colony and a ""highly diverse marine ecosystem,"" a spokesperson for the trust said.  The theme for World Wetlands Day 2023 is ""It's Time for Wetlands Restoration"", stressing the importance of not just protecting, but also restoring wetland habitat.

Britain's ugliest dog Peggy gets prize-winning makeover,"The newly-crowned ugliest dog in Britain has enjoyed a makeover after scooping the unflattering accolade. Four-year-old Peggy, believed to be a Pug and Chinese Crested cross - or Pugese - beat seven other pooches when she won the title on Monday. Her prize was a pampering session and professional photo shoot at a grooming salon in Beverley, East Yorkshire. Owner, Holly Middleton, 36, from Leven, described Peggy as being ""great either way"" regardless of the makeover. ""She feels a lot softer. She smells a lot better. Her hair's a lot more fluffy,"" said Ms Middleton.  ""But there's not a lot we can do with the rest."" Salon manager Sam Burton said: ""I think she's really cute in her own way."" Ms Middleton previously said she did not take offence to people referring to her pet as ""ugly"" and described the remark as being made ""always in a humorous way"". She believed Peggy was ""beautiful both inside and out"". Ms Middleton has previously explained how she adopted Peggy  at the end of 2018 when she was the last remaining pup of an accidental litter. She said: ""We loved her the instant we laid eyes on her with her big brown eyes, little tuft of white hair and her tongue lolling out to one side.

Cranes: Survey reveals UK's tallest bird is making wetland comeback,"A breeding programme that began in the East to reverse the extinction of cranes has seen numbers bounce back. The common crane became extinct in the UK in the 1500s but re-emerged in the Norfolk Broads in 1979.  A survey by the RSPB has revealed 71 pairs across the UK in 2022, with the population estimated at more than 200 birds. Conservation scientist Andrew Stanbury said the government must now ""choose to strengthen, not dismantle"" laws protecting wetland habitats. After returning to the Norfolk Broads in 1979, the RSPB said numbers of the birds were steadily increasing with populations found in South Yorkshire, the Fens and, with assistance of a crane introduction project, the Somerset Levels and Moors.  In November two cranes became the first ever recorded pair to fledge young at the Snape Wetlands Nature Reserve on the Suffolk coast. Adult cranes stand at about 1.2m (4ft) tall and are known for their complex ""display"" behaviour where they perform bows, pirouettes and bobs. The ""naturally secretive"" birds can be seen at RSPB nature reserves including Lakenheath Fen, Nene Washes and Willow Tree Fen in Lincolnshire. The birds are making a comeback thanks to restoration and protection of their wetland habitats.  The RSPB said peatland restoration and wetland protection had significantly contributed to the recovery with more than 80% of the breeding population found on protected sites, and 21 pairs on RSPB nature reserves alone. Damon Bridge, chair of the UK Crane Working Group, said: ""Much of the UK's best wetland habitats are protected areas and provide sites for cranes to nest safely.  ""Wetlands help lock carbon away, reducing green house gas emissions, and can also help to reduce flood risk to homes and communities as well as being wonderful areas for wildlife.  ""We must continue to protect them.""       Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Bird flu: What is it and what's behind the outbreak?,"The world is going through its worst-ever outbreak of bird flu. The highly infectious H5N1 strain is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of wild birds and millions of domestic ones. It is also being found in mammals. Bird flu is an infectious disease of poultry and wild birds that has been around for a century. It usually flares up in autumn before fading away in spring and summer.  ""It originated amongst ducks in Europe and Asia, and spread to other birds,"" says Paul Digard, a professor of virology in the Roslin Institute at Edinburgh University.  The H5N1 virus, which is the most prevalent strain now, was first reported in China in 1996.  It can spread through entire flocks of domestic birds within a matter of days, through birds' droppings and saliva, or through contaminated feed and water.  The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) has recorded almost 42 million individual cases in domestic and wild birds since the outbreak began in October 2021. Almost 15 million domestic birds, including poultry, have died from the disease, and more than 193 million more have been culled. In some European countries it has led to egg shortages in shops. More wild birds than ever before have been killed by this outbreak - with sea birds being especially hard hit. The current virus has affected 80 different bird species,"" says Professor Munir Iqbal, the head of the Avian Influenza Virus (AIV) group at the Pirbright Institute.  More than 40% of the skua population in Scotland, and thousands of Dalmatian pelicans in Greece have died.  Scientists are unsure why this outbreak is so much worse than others. It may be that the virus has mutated to enable it to spread more readily from bird to bird, or to hang around longer in the environment. Dr Nancy Beerens, bird flu expert at Wageningen Bioveterinary Research in the Netherlands, which analyses suspected bird flu samples, says the virus may now be ubiquitous in wild birds.   ""As the virus now has infected many wild bird species, it becomes unlikely that it will disappear again from the bird population,"" she says.  China has been vaccinating its domestic poultry flocks.  However, other countries avoid this because it is hard to judge which birds have been made immune and which have not - and so the meat and eggs from vaccinated flocks cannot be sold abroad. ""There are strict export controls when a country decides to vaccinate,"" says Dr Maurice Pitesky of the School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis.   Governments in EU countries and North America have instead generally told their farmers to cull all the poultry in any flock in which bird flu has broken out. Farmers in the UK and France have also been told to bring free range poultry flocks indoors, to stop them being infected by wild birds.  Despite the commercial drawbacks of vaccinating poultry, governments in France and the Netherlands have begun trials of vaccines to try and bring the bird flu epidemic under control. WOAH has counted 119 outbreaks of the virus amongst mammals, although it says this is undoubtedly an underestimate.  Species affected include dolphins and seals, foxes and otters in the UK, grizzly bears in the US and mink in Spain.  It is believed the infected mammals had fed on dead or sick wild birds which had the virus. There has been no evidence yet of the virus spreading between mammals. The virus may also have mutated to infect the mammals more easily. The World Health Organization (WHO) says 870 humans have been infected with avian flu over the past 20 years, and 457 have died.  These cases occurred when humans came into close contact with infected birds. The World Health Organization says the further spread of the H5N1 virus will have to be monitored closely to see whether it is mutating into a form which can spread amongst humans.

World's oldest preserved brain found in prehistoric fish fossil,"The ""oldest example of a well-preserved vertebrate brain"" has been identified in a 319 million-year-old fish fossil. The fossilised Coccocephalus wildi was found in a coal mine in Lancashire more than a century ago and had been sitting in the archives of Manchester Museum. Research by teams from universities in Birmingham and Michigan found its skull contained a brain and cranial nerves.   Palaeontologist Dr Sam Giles said the ""unexpected find"" gave a ""startling insight"" into brain evolution. The fossil of the now-extinct fish was originally recovered from a layer of soapstone in the roof of the Lancashire mine and was first scientifically described in 1925. Though only its skull was recovered, scientists from the University of Birmingham (UoB) and the University of Michigan (UoM) believe  it would have been 6 to 8ins (15 to 20cm) long and was probably a carnivore. A UoB representative said soft tissues like brains normally decay quickly and ""very rarely fossilise"", but when this fish died, it was ""probably quickly buried in sediments with little oxygen present"" as such environments ""can slow the decomposition of soft body parts"". They said the skull fossil was the only known specimen of its species, so only non-destructive techniques were used during the study. They added that the research team had not been looking for a brain when examining the skull fossil, but found the distinct object which had features found in vertebrate brains, such as bilateral symmetry and hollow spaces. Dr Giles said the ""unexpected find of a three-dimensionally preserved vertebrate brain gives us a startling insight into the neural anatomy of ray-finned fish"". ""It tells us a more complicated pattern of brain evolution than suggested by living species alone, allowing us to better define how and when present day bony fishes evolved,"" she added. UoM researcher Rodrigo Figueroa said the ""superficially unimpressive and small fossil [not only] shows us the oldest example of a fossilised vertebrate brain, but it also shows that much of what we thought about brain evolution from living species alone will need reworking"".

Formal bid made for Flow Country Unesco status,"Unesco has been formally asked to consider awarding World Heritage Site status to 469,500 acres (190,000ha) of Scotland's Flow Country. The area of Caithness and Sutherland contains the most intact and extensive blanket bog system in the world. World Heritage status is an internationally-recognised designation given to places of cultural, historical or scientific significance. A decision on the Flow Country's nomination is expected next year. Scottish locations with the Unesco status include the St Kilda archipelago, Skara Brae prehistoric village and the Antonine Wall. Globally, the sites include Australia's Great Barrier Reef and Egypt's Historic Cairo. The Flow Country Partnership, a collaboration that includes Highland Council, NatureScot, RSPB Scotland, University of the Highlands and Islands and Wildland Ltd, handed its 250-page nomination dossier to the UK government. It was then submitted to Unesco, a UN organisation promoting cooperation on education and science, for consideration. Dr Steven Andrews, of the Flow Country Partnership, said: ""A vast amount of work has gone into getting the nomination dossier prepared for delivery to Unesco in Paris and we are hugely grateful to both the UK government and also the Scottish government for the support they have provided in helping us reach this important milestone.""  UK Arts minister Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay said the Flow Country would be a worthy recipient of World Heritage Site status. Scotland's environment minister Mairi McAllan added the peatlands played an important part in combatting climate change. The Flow Country is an expanse of peatlands, bogs, pools, lochs, hills and mountains covering large parts of the north Highlands. It is about 50 miles across - roughly the distance from Glasgow to Edinburgh - and covers a total of almost a million acres of land. The peatlands, which have been growing for 10,000 years, are formed by layers of waterlogged mosses and other vegetation as they die off. The plant life does not fully decay due to acidic conditions, so the material retains some of the carbon it absorbed when at the surface of the bog. In places, the peat is 10m thick - deep enough to submerge two double decker buses stacked on top of one another. The Flows provide habitat for birds, otters and water voles, and is carpeted with sphagnum moss. Its other plant life include sundews, which feed on insects that get trapped in their sticky tentacles. It helps combat climate change by storing an estimated 400 million tonnes of carbon. Damaging the peat risks releasing harmful greenhouses gases into the atmosphere. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-64497032
PG Wodehouse books saved from Monmouthshire landfill,"A collection of rare, vintage books destined for the tip have been saved by eagle-eyed bin collectors. The books, written by PG Wodehouse, were due to be dumped at the Five Lanes Recycling Centre near Caldicot in Monmouthshire. But a refuse worker, who is an avid reader, realised they were something special and saved them.  One of the books, dating from the 1930s and featuring characters Bertie Wooster and valet Jeeves, is worth £200. Monmouthshire council now plans to sell the 12 books to raise money for tree planting. ""He brought them to us and said these could be something quite special,"" said the council's re-use and education officer Rebecca Blount about the find. A book collector from Tintern then helped date the collection to the 1930s, with the dust covers in particular ""quite rare"". PG Wodehouse was one of the most widely read humourists of the 20th century.  His books included the famous characters Bertie Wooster and valet Jeeves, and were turned into a TV drama starring Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry in the 1990s.  The books are not the only gems that have been found at the council's recycling centres. A rare cloth Mickey Mouse toy worth about £300 was saved from the rubbish tip in early 2022, Ms Blount said.  It is hoped the latest discoveries will find a new book-loving owner, with the proceeds going towards tree planting. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64494954
Northern Ireland conservation: More than 100 species added to priority list,"More than 100 species have been added to a priority list in Northern Ireland. The list covers species that need conservation because they are in decline, rare or of particular importance to the UK or Ireland. Another 113 species have been added to the list, bringing the total number to 594, after its first update in more than a decade. Additions include bog orchid, the kingfisher, Atlantic bluefin tuna and four types of bee. The last list, which came out in 2010, featured 481 species, meaning the list has grown by more than a quarter. It is published by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) to meet the requirements of the Wildlife and Natural Environment Act. Experts and organisations are consulted to help inform reviewers about which species should be included. They are then selected on the basis of the need for ""conservation action as a priority due to the degree of their decline, rarity and importance in an all-Ireland and UK context"", according to the DAERA website.   Each species group is scrutinised to assess the decline, risks and threats they face.   This is the first section of a staged review, with the new list due to come into effect later in February.  Experts from the wildlife organisation, Ulster Wildlife, were among those advising on the list. The charity's director of nature, climate and environment, Dr Annika Clements, said the updated list was welcome, particularly as Northern Ireland's upcoming biodiversity strategy includes ""the ambition to strengthen the duty of public bodies to protect and enhance biodiversity"".  The strategy was due to be delivered in 2020. A study that same year ranked the region 12th worst for biodiversity loss out of 240 countries surveyed.   ""We welcome the addition in particular of these marine species that are known to be of significant conservation concern and need action within Northern Ireland,"" Dr Clements added. She said the addition of certain types of seaweed and algae were positive from the point of view of carbon being captured in seawater and coastal ecosystems, so potentially helping to reduce emissions.

Mudlarker discovers cup in Thames that may be rare Roman find,"A mudlarker says he has been told he has found a ""rare"" near-complete Roman cup from the banks of the River Thames.  Malcom Russell, 49, from London, pulled the artefact from the mud when he ventured out last week, during some of the lowest tides of the year. He said Museum of London archaeologists believed the object might date back to the 2nd Century AD. Mr Russell said it was ""high up"" on his ""list of dream finds"", and his Twitter post about the find had gone viral. Popularised by the Victorians, mudlarking involves going down to the banks of the Thames at low tide and searching for interesting historical objects. Mr Russell, who is from Walthamstow in east London and has been mudlarking for seven years, says he ""was excited about what might turn up"" because ""when the tide is super low obviously more of the riverbed gets exposed and you stand a greater chance of finding things"". Despite this, he said after a few hours he still had not found anything - until he saw ""a dark patch under about half a metre of water"". ""Normally you only find fragments of Roman pottery, little bits and pieces,"" he said, ""but I started to reach down into the water and pulled on the handle of this bit of pottery and it sort of just kept on going - and then suddenly in my hands I had a mostly complete Roman vessel.""  He continued: ""I was so astounded and excited at the time that I nearly dumped all of the mud and sand out of it that was inside, but I was reminded of a friend who said you shouldn't do that because the Museum of London like to X-ray complete pots to see whether they've got any original content in.""  He added he had only ever seen a couple of things that size turn up in the past seven or eight years. ""When you think that over time it's broken or it gets rolled around in the river and smashed up, it's miraculous that something that complete could survive,"" he said.  He explained that although the vessel was missing one of its handles, he had contacted the Museum of London to see if they were interested in examining it. He says archaeologists told him it looked like ""a rare find"", and although no original contents were found in the cup, it was likely to be more than 1,800 years old. He said: ""They have discovered it is most likely a contemporaneous copy inspired by a much more expensive type of vessel made along the River Rhine in the 2nd Century AD. So it's kind of like a super bargain basement version of a vessel that was made then.  ""The museum said they hadn't identified another example that's ever been found in this state from mudlarking in London,"" he added. Mr Russell said experts believed there was ""certainly a very good chance it would have been used for wine or another liquid"".  Discussing what motivated him to go mudlarking, he said: ""Everything I find is little portals into the past, and something that complete is very evocative, it sets your mind racing as to what was it used for, who were the last hands to touch it before it ended up here, why was it thrown away, it's very rich fodder for the imagination really.  ""It's contributing to our knowledge of London's past. It definitely excites me, you don't just find this stuff for yourself, you find it so everyone can learn from it."" It is unclear whether the museum intends to keep the artefact once its provenance is confirmed, but Mr Russell said he would happily donate it to their collection. The Port of London Authority says a valid permit is required for anyone wishing to search the Thames' muds. A spokesperson for The Museum of London said: ""The object has been handed to the Finds Officer at the museum.  ""We're not able to comment on it at this stage until some initial research and analysis has been done."" Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

"Horses and dogs sailed with Vikings to Britain, say scientists","Vikings sailing from Scandinavia to England brought horses, dogs and perhaps even pigs with them, according to analysis of bone remains. Invading Vikings were previously thought to have largely stolen animals from villages in Britain. The findings also provide evidence Viking leaders had a close relationship with animals and travelled with them, the lead scientist says. The 9th Century bones were found in burial mounds in Heath Wood, Derbys.  Cremated animal and human remains had been found buried together, suggesting the creatures had special meaning and been burned on the same funeral pyre as humans, doctoral researcher Tessi Löffelmann, from Durham University and Vrije Universiteit Brussels, told BBC News. ""They were treated more like companion animals rather than just for economic purposes,"" she said. ""I find it really touching and it suggests we underestimate just how important animals were to Vikings.""  The horses and dogs would have travelled on Viking longboats across the North Sea, a journey that could take several weeks. ""Horses back then were smaller than horses are now, which could have made the journey a little bit more accommodating, but it was still probably wet and uncomfortable,"" Ms Löffelmann said. Prof Julian Richards, from the University of York, who co-directed the excavations, said: ""The Bayeux Tapestry depicts Norman cavalry disembarking horses from their fleet but this is the first scientific demonstration that Viking warriors were transporting horses to England 200 years earlier.""  Norse mythology and 13th Century sagas show animals played a big role in Viking life. The scientists also found a pig bone in Heath Wood, the only large Scandinavian cremation site in Britain, but this may have been a token or part of a game brought from Scandinavia, rather than a live animal. They discovered the animals had come from Scandinavia by analysing the strontium in their bones. This element occurs naturally in rocks, soil and water, before making its way into plants - and, when these are eaten, bones and teeth. Archaeologist Cat Jarman, who has worked at Heath Wood but was not involved in the research, said using this technique on cremated bone was ""really exciting"" because many Viking burials used cremation. ""It has opened up a whole new avenue of evidence,"" she said.  The findings are published in scientific journal Plos One.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-64431142
Paedophile pop star Gary Glitter freed from prison,"Disgraced former pop star Gary Glitter has been freed from prison after serving half his 16-year jail term.  Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was sentenced in 2015 for attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault and one of having sex with a girl under 13. At the time, the judge said it was clear his victims ""were all profoundly affected"" by the abuse. Glitter was one of the biggest music stars of the 1970s.  During sentencing, Judge Alistair McCreath said he could find ""no real evidence that"" Gadd had atoned for his crimes.  ""You did all of them real and lasting damage and you did so for no other reason than to obtain sexual gratification for yourself of a wholly improper kind,"" he said. Gadd showed no emotion as he left the dock at Southwark Crown Court. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64509245
Zara Larsson: Why do celebrities wear offensive outfits?,"As a celebrity, choosing what to wear can be a big decision. Thankfully, you'll probably have a team dedicated to making sure the choice of outfit is stylish, eye-catching and memorable. But sometimes, outfits can be remembered for the wrong reasons, as Zara Larsson found out. The Swedish singer hit headlines when she wore a dress featuring album art from Norwegian metal act Burzum. Unfortunately for Zara, the project was led by Norwegian musician Kristian ""Varg"" Vikernes. He's known for holding neo-Nazi views, and has been called ""anti-Semitic and xenophobic"". Vikernes also got a prison sentence for murdering the guitarist of a rival black metal band and setting fire to churches in Norway. Not the best look. Zara was criticised when she appeared on TikTok, wearing the outfit at an awards show. She said she had no idea of the link, and that the design was chosen because the images looked cool. ""It was unfortunate...,"" the 25-year-old told Swedish publication Aftonbladet.  She said the garment wasn't Burzum merchandise and was created by Belgian fashion designer Raf Simons. Zara joins a long list of celebrities to cop flak for their clothing choices. In August 2022, TikToker Addison Rae posed in a Holy Trinity bikini from the brand Praying.  The white two-piece had ""Father"" printed on one cup, ""Son"" on the other, and ""Holy Spirit"" across the front of the bottoms. After feeling the wrath and fury of some Christians, who accused her of blasphemy and disrespecting religion, Addison deleted the post from Instagram. In 2014, Khloe Kardashian wore a war bonnet - a type of native American headdress - to her niece North West's Coachella-themed birthday party. This upset indigenous groups, who object to the use of the sacred item as a fashion accessory. They were especially annoyed because, at the time, NFL team the Washington Redskins had dropped its name because the term was disparaging to Native American people. It's now known as the Washington Commanders. Khloe again faced backlash for cultural appropriation when she posted a selfie wearing a niqab - a religious covering - while on holiday. Selena Gomez was criticised for wearing a bindi at the MTV Movie Awards, with some saying the item on the forehead is a religious tradition in Hinduism and not meant as a fashion accessory. Selena said the song Come and Get It ""has that almost Hindu feel"", adding that she's ""learned a lot about the culture, and I think it's beautiful. I think it's fun to incorporate that into the performance."" Also in 2013, Katy Perry dressing as a geisha for her performance of Unconditionally at the American Music Awards caused outrage for appropriation of Japanese culture. Katy said even in her ""intention to appreciate Japanese culture, I did wrong with a performance. And I didn't know that I did it wrong until I heard people saying I did it wrong"". With so many big names catching heat over the years, what exactly is the process behind dressing a celebrity? According to celeb stylist Alex Longmore, there is often a ""really long process"" that goes with creating a look for celebrities. ""Different celebs have different looks. So a musician or someone who is in a band, their persona is so massive,"" says Alex, who has worked with the likes of Little Mix, tells BBC Newsbeat. With A-list stars in particular, she says there is ""huge amounts of pressure"" to get it right. ""They want to create uniqueness, they want to be cutting edge, they want to be telling a story and they want to grab headlines."" Stylists, she says, work with artists but also the management. ""So it's a big massive production, working with a pop star. And so much prep goes into it, because they can't be seen to be wearing something that someone else has worn.""  As for avoiding items which can offend people - Alex says in her experience, there are no real checks that take place. ""I think basically someone [in Zara's case] hasn't checked and it's one of those things that has such huge ramifications.""  ""But it's such a simple error. They just haven't thought it through.""

Eurovision 2023: John Lydon competing to represent Ireland in Liverpool,"Public Image Ltd would not be first on many people's list of likely Eurovision Song Contest entrants.  But the band John Lydon formed after the Sex Pistols split in 1978 is one of six hoping to represent Ireland in Liverpool on 13 May. The country's winner will be chosen by a national jury made up of music experts, an international jury and a public vote on Ireland's The Late Late Show on RTE from 21:30 GMT on Friday.  The sound of Lydon's song - a love letter to his wife who has Alzheimer's -  was not what I expected.  ""It's very hard to be away from her but I have to do this,"" the most famous man in punk tells me in his dressing room. ""I have to bring awareness to this problem. I miss her like mad and she was talking to me last night on the iPad and she was crying."" The poignant lyrics about happier times are genuinely touching and will resonate with viewers. Lydon believes he is in a better position than most, caring for Nora, as some ""just can't bear the weight"" of looking after someone with dementia. ""It breaks my heart when people tell me they have similar stories,"" the 67-year-old says. ""I've had hardly any sleep for a really long time because I have to make sure she's all right at night."" He says this experience has meant he has ""a wonderful opportunity"" to share what it is really like ""trying to jog her brain gently"". Alzheimer's affects nearly one million people in the UK and 55 million worldwide and numbers are forecast to rise sharply over the coming decades. Last year the first drug to slow it down was described as ""momentous"", although its impact will help future diagnosis rather than people with the condition now.  After rehearsals, John says he nearly broke down, as the lyrics mean a lot to him and at times ""they're too accurate"". He is enjoying the interest, pleased Simon Cowell is not involved, and dismisses a negative comment he made on Irish radio about Eurovision as a joke taken out of context.  There is a press scrum around him after all the acts are introduced and Public Image Ltd is easily the Irish selection show's most-talked about, but it does not mean they will be chosen.  At times he feels a bit overwhelmed talking about the song and his wife, who is the reason he is competing. My family is Irish and growing up I was constantly reminded how successful Ireland was in Eurovision. No other country has matched its record seven wins, but it has failed to qualify for the grand final since 2018. Connolly is the favourite to win Friday's Eurosong selection contest with Midnight Summer Night. ""Eurovision has always been such a big part of my life,"" the 19-year-old tells me. ""When I was watching it, Ireland's never been winning but I know the history of it and it's always made me go back and think we can do it again."" She says ""it would be a dream to represent Ireland"" especially because ""the competition has upped itself massively"" lately.  The 2021 Eurovision winners Måneskin are up for best new act at next week's Grammy Awards, proving the song contest really does have the power to go global. Wild Youth is another finalist and its singer Conor O'Donohoe was inspired after watching the Italian rock stars perform on YouTube. His band have supported Niall Horan, Lewis Capaldi and Westlife on tour and for a while have been tipped as Ireland's next big thing, but are still awaiting their big break overseas.  ""Not for any sob story, the pandemic was hard,"" O'Donohoe says. ""In 2019 we had the two most-played songs on Irish radio and we were doing Europe with Kodaline, it was amazing. We're a big live act and when we lost the live element it hurt us"". It is a big deal for him to be on The Late Late Show, but he is clearly nervous and does not want to get ahead of himself about winning. ""It's a place where you can go and perform, you can wear what you like, you can sound how you like, you can look how you like and you can be who you like and everyone supports it and that's an incredible thing"". Adgy, Leila Jane and K Muni & ND complete the selection show line-up. Lots of countries choose their Eurovision act via TV competitions. The UK has done this in the past, but this year a management company, working with the BBC, will pick an act. I'm part of the Eurovisioncast team - the new podcast that will bring the latest on the song contest in the run-up to May's competition - where we discuss things like selection shows in more detail, as well as how Liverpool is planning to stage a global event watched by 160 million people.

Beyoncé ticket rush begins as pre-sale opens for UK tour dates,"Beyoncé fans have joined the rush to get tickets for her first solo tour for seven years, as the first pre-sale opened for her UK dates. O2 customers were the first to have access at 10:00 GMT, but some reported problems with its app and website. Those who did manage to purchase tickets reported prices ranging from £56 to £199, with VIP ""on stage"" seats at a wallet-busting £1,950 to £2,390. There will be further pre-sales on Friday and Monday. Tickets for the pop superstar's five UK stadium shows in Cardiff, Edinburgh, Sunderland and London will then go on general sale on Tuesday. The UK concerts are part of a 43-date world tour in support of her Grammy-nominated Renaissance album.  The shows kick off in Sweden on 10 May, before landing at Cardiff's Principality Stadium a week later.  She will then visit Edinburgh's Murrayfield on 20 May, Sunderland's Stadium of Light on 23 May and London's Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on 29 and 30 May. Beyoncé has set the standard ticket prices at roughly the same level as her last stadium tour, with her husband Jay-Z in 2018, when entry started at £51.  However, the VIP packages, some of which included guaranteed front row seats, are more than four times that tour's top price of £475. Many fans on social media ridiculed the cost, reminding Beyoncé that she advised people to ""quit their jobs"" on her recent single, Break My Soul. Billboard magazine predicted the five-month tour could earn the star up to $275m (£223m). The phrase ""O2 Priority"" trended on Twitter after the company's app and website fell over ahead of Beyoncé's ticket sale.  Hundreds of fans were upset that they couldn't access the site, but others were more concerned that they'd missed out on a free coffee from Greggs. In a statement, the company apologised ""to anyone experiencing difficulties"".  ""Tickets are selling and we're seeing huge demand. We're doing everything we can behind the scenes to help keep the app running smoothly."" The O2 app and website also crashed when the company had pre-sale access for another major tour, for comedian Peter Kay, in November. In North America, Beyoncé fans are being asked to register for Ticketmaster's Verified Fan process - which the company says will filter out touts - before ticket pre-sales open on Monday. Those who have registered will be entered into a ""lottery-style process"" if demand outstrips the number of available tickets. Politicians in the US, who are already investigating Ticketmaster over the fumbled sale of Taylor Swift's Eras tour, will be keeping an eagle eye on how the systems cope with Beyoncé's concerts. Frankie Austick, 19, secured his tickets though the O2 Priority website after his app crashed. ""It's such a nerve-wracking experience, such a nail-biting one, but so worth it in the end,"" he told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat. ""To have got through, to have got to the front of the queue, to have got the tickets, it's just so amazing."" Frankie, who is from Durham, paid £59 for his ticket and said he was ""so happy to be seeing her in Sunderland of all places"". ""I have lived in the north east for my whole life and to see such a big artist giving us the support that we need... for so many people it will be the only chance to see her, when she comes locally.""  After waiting over an hour in Ticketmaster's virtual queue, Katie Battersby made it to the booking page only to be taken all the way back to the start with 138,000 people ahead of her. Katie, 25, recorded her experience for Newsbeat, saying that she, like so many, tried to go to the O2 priority website again. ""And it completely crashed. I have had two friends who have got to this page and they have been kicked out of the queue."" In spite of today's disappointment and frustration, Katie is determined to get her tickets. ""We will be back tomorrow to try again."" Beyoncé's last outing as a solo artist was 2016's Formation tour, which saw the star perform in front of a 60ft LED cube called the ""monolith"".  She then staged a joint tour with Jay-Z, in which the couple re-enacted their estrangement and reconciliation every night, in a two-and-a-half hour musical melodrama. Last week, the star performed her first headlining concert in four years at the opening of a luxury hotel in Dubai, but did not play any of her new material. She was reportedly paid $24m (£19.4m) for the one-off show, but faced criticism for performing in a country where homosexuality and gender reassignment are outlawed.  Critics said that contradicted the message of her latest album, which explicitly celebrates black and queer dance culture.  Beyoncé conceived the Renaissance album as ""a place to dream and to find escape"" during the pandemic, layering her songs with multiple samples and references to club music, from Nile Rodgers' Studio 54 disco grooves and Grace Jones' imperious soul, to less-celebrated movements like bounce and dancehall. Exclaim magazine called it ""the sound of a once-in-a-generation superstar performing at her peak"", while the Guardian described it as ""a breath-taking, maximalist tour de force"". Unusually, Beyoncé has avoided making music videos for the album, meaning the Renaissance tour will be fans' first chance to see her visual interpretation of tracks like Break My Soul, Alien Superstar and Cuff It. The star generally reworks and updates old songs to fit her current aesthetic, so we may also hear clubbed-up remixes of hits like Crazy In Love, Formation and Single Ladies. The former Destiny's Child star may reveal further details at this weekend's Grammys, where she is up for nine awards, including album of the year. OK ladies, now let's get in formation. The Beehive swarmed Beyoncé's pre-sale this morning, putting the O2 app and website out of action just as tickets were about to go on sale. Fans are understandably frustrated, but it's unclear how many tickets were available in the first place.  Under usual circumstances, only 10-20% of tickets are reserved for pre-sales in the UK - and there are three such events before the Renaissance tour officially opens up to the public next week. So it's likely there were fewer than 7,000 tickets available for each of the star's six UK shows on Thursday morning. With every customer allowed to buy four tickets, it's possible that only 1,500 lucky fans will have secured seats at each venue. If you weren't one of them, don't despair. There'll be more opportunities next Tuesday, when the bulk of tickets are put up for sale. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-64496382
"Eurovision: Liverpool stage inspired by a wide hug, BBC says","Eurovision's stage will use a design that demonstrates ""how music can transcend borders and bring people together"", the BBC has said. The song contest will take place at Liverpool Arena in May, with the city hosting the event on behalf of Ukraine. The BBC said the stage was inspired by ""a wide hug"" to give the impression of ""opening its arms to Ukraine"". It will be created by design firm Yellow Studio, which previously worked on the 2022 Grammy Awards ceremony. The stage, which will cover 2,300 sq ft (220 sq m) of the 11,000-capacity venue, will host the contest's semi-finals on 9 and 11 May and the grand final on 13 May. The BBC, which is host broadcaster for the event, said the design of it was intended to demonstrate ""how music can transcend borders and bring people together as one unit"". It said the stage took inspiration from ""a wide hug that enfolds the Liverpool Arena"" and was intended to give the impression of ""opening its arms to Ukraine, the show's performers and guests from across the world"". First-look images of the design show the stage extending out into the audience standing area, which will be sited in front of a section of booth-like seating where the acts from participating countries will stay while they are not performing. Yellow Studio director Julio Himede said it was ""a wonderful honour to be collaborating with the BBC and the production team to design this year's Eurovision Song Contest set"". ""This year's contest unites Ukraine and the UK to celebrate the unique cultures of both,"" he added. The branding and the United By Music slogan for this year's contest were revealed in January, with artwork showing hearts beating together in the colours of the Ukrainian and UK flags. Liverpool won a bidding process to be chosen as the host city after it was decided Ukraine, the winners of the 2022 contest, could not take up hosting duties due to the ongoing war in the country. The BBC also confirmed the typeface used in the branding was called Penny Lane after The Beatles' 1967 song, in a nod to both the city's rich musical heritage and its iron street signs. All the build-up, insights and analysis will be explored each week on a new BBC podcast called Eurovisioncast.

BBC News channel announces chief presenter line-up for revamp,"The BBC has announced its line-up of chief presenters for its revamped TV news channel. It follows the decision to merge the two existing news channels, aimed at viewers in the UK and around the world. Matthew Amroliwala, Christian Fraser, Yalda Hakim, Lucy Hockings and Maryam Moshiri will lead the new line-up. Other hosts on the two current channels include Jane Hill, Martine Croxall and Ben Brown. However they have not been named among the new chief presenters. Another current presenter, Geeta Guru-murthy, tweeted shortly before going on air on Thursday: ""Catch me whilst you can!"" There are currently 18 presenters across the two existing channels. As well as appointing five UK-based lead anchors, the new channel is now recruiting eight correspondents who will also co-present, and two presenters based in Washington DC. BBC News CEO Deborah Turness said she was ""thrilled"" to announce the lead presenters.  ""This team's editorial leadership, talent, knowledge and flair make them the ideal presenters to bring the BBC's trusted journalism to people at home in the UK and around the globe, and to guide audiences through the big stories as they break,"" she said. Three other long-serving news presenters - Joanna Gosling, David Eades and Tim Willcox - recently announced their departures from the corporation. Gosling gave an emotional sign-off during her final appearance after 23 years last week. The revamped news channel is due to launch this spring. It will have the ability to split into two separate feeds - for the UK and elsewhere - at certain times of day and if there is breaking news that's mainly of interest to a domestic audience. It will be anchored from London during the daytime and evening in the UK, and from Washington DC and Singapore overnight. Of the new chief presenters, Amroliwala currently hosts Global on BBC World News, while Fraser fronts The Context on both existing channels, as well as co-presenting BBC Two's Newsnight. Moshiri is a regular face on both channels, while Hakim presents the global Impact and Our World strands, and Hockings has Live with Lucy Hockings on BBC World News. Overall, around 50 jobs are expected to be lost on and off air as part of the merger. The appointments to the revamped news channel comes against the backdrop of a large number of big-name presenters leaving the BBC. Ken Bruce, Paul O'Grady, Vanessa Feltz, Emily Maitlis and Dan Walker are among the broadcasters who have left or are leaving, to take up jobs in the commercial sector. In the case of news presenters, it is specifically the merging of the two existing channels that has prompted job cuts.  However, there are a plethora of reasons for the exit of major entertainment personalities - ranging from the publication of their salaries to the increasingly fragmented media industry.

BBC's Repair Shop praised for Tolkien letters work,"A man who corresponded with JRR Tolkien as a schoolboy has praised the BBC's Repair Shop for restoring letters from the Lord of the Rings' author. David Best, from Herefordshire, read Tolkien's books when he was 15 and was inspired to translate his poems into runes, an old alphabet. The letters from the author were in disrepair before the Repair Shop experts got to work. ""I was completely astonished at the quality of their work,"" Mr Best said. He received four letters from Tolkien at the time but said he was not surprised to get the responses. ""It seemed he was a teacher, I was a pupil. I think it seemed, in my naïve way, pretty OK for him to write back with some marks and comments,"" Mr Best said. In his replies, the Hobbit author wrote in one case: ""I had time to look. It seems very correct. I'm glad you used the genuine English runes."" Over the years, Mr Best compiled the letters with other writings and drawings into two notebooks but they were in need of some expert help. Bookbinder Chris Shaw, on the Repair Shop, put them into a bound book and removed marks including ones left by sticky tape. ""The team are just as nice in real life as they come across in the programme,"" Mr Best said. He added they appeared to be keen Tolkien fans and had him translating their names into runes and Elvish language. ""In fact one of the team declared he was going to have it done as a tattoo so I hope I didn't make any mistakes in writing his name."" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

"Nolly: Helena Bonham Carter on soaps, sexism and the death of cinema","If you're under 45, you've probably never heard of Noele ""Nolly"" Gordon. But you'll have heard of A-list actress Helena Bonham Carter and It's A Sin and Doctor Who writer Russell T Davies. The prolific pair have come together for a three-part drama about the rise and fall of Nolly, a TV trailblazer and legendary star of long-defunct soap opera Crossroads. Nolly played Meg Mortimer/Richardson, owner of the Crossroads motel, from 1964 until she was  sacked out of the blue in 1981. The news left the nation's soap fans in shock. Nolly was a much-loved star and the show, watched by 15 million people a week in its heyday, had revolved around her.  Having written for soaps himself early in his career - he even penned a trial script for Crossroads just before it was axed in 1988 - Davies was keen to give the late actress one more moment in the spotlight and examine why she was suddenly axed. ""In the industry, she's very much spoken of as a diva and a bit of a monster,"" he explains. ""Yet when I spoke to the cast, it was the opposite picture. They loved her. Someone who was a very powerful, successful woman has been spoken of as a bitch afterwards. How does that automatically happen? It's monstrous. She's tough, strong and opinionated [but] you wouldn't use those words on a man."" The soap's creator, Reg Watson, ""invented Crossroads around her"", explains Bonham Carter, who plays the title role in the ITVX show. But he left the Midlands-based soap to return to his native Australia in 1974, where he famously went on to create Neighbours. ""They wouldn't have sacked her if Reg had still been there,"" Davies says. Without giving too much away, Bonham Carter believes ATV - who made the Midlands show - were perhaps ""threatened"" by Nolly's power. ""She was cleverer than all the suits. She knew how to make the show work. She was literally calling the shots. Had it been now, I think she would have been directing and producing very, very quickly."" And when you look at her CV, you can quite believe it.  As a young woman in 1938, Nolly was credited as the first person to be seen as a moving image on colour TV. Alongside numerous early acting roles, she was also a pioneer, hosting ITV's first chat show, Tea with Noele Gordon, and later, Lunchbox. She was also ITV's first female sports presenter as the host of Midland Sport, produced several shows, and became an ATV executive. The star was also the first woman to interview a British prime minister (Harold Macmillan). Her talent was vast and varied. ""She would so have been a loose woman,"" Davies tells me enthusiastically, referencing the current ITV1 lunchtime show. ""She might have ended up like Fiona Bruce,"" Bonham Carter counters. ""I could easily see her marshalling Question Time. ""In character she was very male, but maybe she had to be because that was how she could get on in a man's world. She didn't play on being female, even though she loved men."" Nolly was 61 when she lost her job on Crossroads. ""I feel she was cut off in her prime,"" says Bonham Carter. ""I feel like championing her, I'm championing every woman of a certain age. We might just be cut off because we're deemed too old. Hang on, we can't be irrelevant and obsolete - we're just getting to know how to do everything!"" Of course, it wasn't only ageing that a woman would be up against. London-born Nolly never married and had no children, which was considered a curiosity at the time - although her devoted on-screen children Jill (Jane Rossington) and Sandy (Roger Tonge) called her mother off set as well as on. And she had great friends including her co-star Tony Adams (played in Nolly by Augustus Prew) and comic and TV presenter Larry Grayson (Mark Gatiss). ""There's a speech in episode three where she says, if you're a woman and you're not married, you don't have children… then you're viewed as odd or strange. And there's a silent army of women with no name,"" Bonham Carter explains. After she was axed, Nolly went on to star in Gypsy in Leicester and took several other theatre roles. But her career never really recovered. ""Things have moved on now. Raquel from Corrie (Sarah Lancashire, now in Happy Valley) is now the greatest star on British television,"" Davies says. But it was different in the 1970s and '80s, when it was tough to get beyond the typecasting. As a fan of the soaps, would he ever consider creating one himself? ""No, no, no - to be absolutely honest, I get asked about once every week!"" he laughs. Bonham Carter adds that she could never be in a soap because she ""wouldn't have the concentration"", adding: ""I am quite easily distractible. Even by the end of The Crown (in which she played Princess Margaret for two seasons) we'd plumbed the depths, it's time for someone else to take over!"" Perhaps surprisingly given her resume, the actress admits to feeling nervous about tackling another real-life character. ""There is a responsibility… and like anybody, I have imposter syndrome, so I want to get it right. I did so much [research] I could do Mastermind on Noele Gordon. And we got to watch lots of Crossroads! ""There are so many big scenes - the fears never go away and also your confidence... mine can just disappear down a plughole very quickly."" Does she think things have changed much for women in the industry? ""There are a lot more women producing and making stories, which is great. ""I remember going to America the first time. I was about 19 or 20. I just felt so deficient because my legs didn't go on for six years. I wasn't particularly sexual. I didn't have the right body. I just thought there was no career for me.  ""And then looking back on it, I was like, why on earth was I so fixated on the fact that I didn't have the right body? And so for years there weren't many roles, but that's basically why I did costume dramas - because I thought those are good parts, that's where the writing is."" These days, we're likely to see more of Bonham Carter on the small screen. ""The movie industry's dying, unfortunately,"" she says. ""We're barely in the cinema. And television is a great new medium. That's where you get the best characters."" Nolly begins streaming on ITVX from Thursday 2 February. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-64375326
Panchayat: The rural drama that became India's most-loved show,"A comedy-drama, centred around the life of a city-bred young man's adventures in a remote village, has emerged as India's most-liked Hindi web show of last year. The second season of Panchayat was also listed as the third most watched - after Rudra: The Edge of Darkness and season three of Aashram - and had the most audience recall, according to a new report. More than 30 million people have watched season two of Panchayat and the show has an enviable IMDB rating of 8.9 out of 10 - higher than that of House of the Dragon or Stranger Things season four. So what is it about Panchayat that has made millions of Indians fall in love with it? The storyline is pretty simple. For lack of a better job, engineering graduate Abhishek Tripathi, played by ‎Jitendra Kumar, takes up employment as a low-level bureaucrat in Phulera - a small fictional village in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. The pay is poor and his workplace - which is also his new home - is the squat building with three rooms that make up the dusty desolate office of the Panchayat (village council). His colleagues are simple rustic men, with little education. Tripathi spends his days trying to sort out mundane problems of the villagers with help and guidance from the council members; and his nights fretting over power outages and his lonely existence - and occasionally running away from snakes.  Desperately seeking a way out, he starts studying at night, preparing for an exam that would brighten his job prospects - and get him out of Phulera.  But as days and weeks and months go by, Tripathi becomes less crochety - friendships are formed and there's even the possibility of some romance.  In a country with a stark rural-urban divide, Panchayat, which is being streamed on Amazon Prime, offers a glimpse into village life to its subscribers who mostly live in cities and know little about rural India. The story of the young bureaucrat and his simple colleagues, told with a lot of humour and affection, appears to have struck a chord with the audiences. Neel Kamal Puri, author and retired college teacher of English literature in the northern city of Chandigarh, says she watched the show during the pandemic. ""The world around us was shut down and seemed rather dark, so I think this is what we all needed, there was something very feel-good about it."" But above all, she says, Panchayat was ""an excellent show"", which stood out for its ""brilliant performances"" and was ""very nuanced in the understanding of its characters"". ""The series has perfect balance on many scores. It neither romanticises, nor vilifies rural life; it has very lively humour, but it's not flippant because it talks about a lot of very serious, pertinent issues.""  Saibal Chatterjee, author and film critic, says ""everyone got hooked on to the show because it is so relatable, so real."" He describes Panchayat as a ""middle-of-the-road"" show which tells simple stories of ordinary people. They were very popular in the 80s and 90s, he says, but then went out of fashion and were replaced by family drama or action. ""Most series nowadays are about spies and the underworld so Panchayat takes you by surprise in the midst of all the action-packed shows. It's a story of real people doing very real tangible things,"" he says. ""And what makes it special is that it's very insightful, but it is very entertaining at the same time and is not stodgy. It talks about serious issues, but in a very light-hearted way. It's funny but the intent is serious,"" he adds. So we see how in Phulera, even though the village council chief is a woman, her husband wields the real power, and a decision to install power connections is taken not on the basis of where they are needed the most but who the important people are. We notice that the Panchayat officials are landed affluent people, but come across a man who's got no money to buy even the basic foodstuff. Scriptwriter Chandan Kumar, who came up with the idea of Panchayat, says he wanted to make a show that would give people a glimpse into rural life but ""the idea was not to make it preachy"". ""We wanted to keep it fun. It had to be entertaining because at the end of the day, people watch shows for entertainment. ""But it's difficult to run away from serious issues,"" he adds. The characters in the show, Mr Kumar says, are not inspired by real people, but the show is inspired by real situations. For the protagonist, Mr Kumar says, ""it's a transitory phase, it's his first job, so I wanted to show how he struggles and learns"". Ms Puri says she's now waiting for the third season, which is due out later in the year. Mr Kumar won't commit to a release date, but promises that ""the story will continue for at least a few more seasons"". ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-64409282
"Beyoncé announces Renaissance world tour, as fans brace for ticket rush","Beyoncé has announced a 43-date world tour in support of her critically-acclaimed Renaissance album, including five nights in the UK. The shows will kick off in Sweden on 10 May, before landing at Cardiff's Principality stadium a week later. Further UK dates will take place in Edinburgh on 20 May, Sunderland on 23 May and London's Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on 29 and 30 May. Ticket demand is expected to be huge for her first solo tour since 2016. A series of pre-sales for the star's UK shows will begin at 10:00 GMT on Thursday, before tickets then go on general sale on Tuesday. In North America, fans are being asked to register for Ticketmaster's Verified Fan process - which the company says will filter out touts - before ticket pre-sales open on Monday. Those who have registered will be entered into a ""lottery-style process"" if demand outstrips the number of available tickets. Politicians in the US, who are already investigating Ticketmaster over the fumbled sale of Taylor Swift's Eras tour, will be keeping an eagle eye on how the systems cope with Beyoncé's concerts. Last week, Beyoncé performed her first headlining concert in four years at the opening of a luxury hotel in Dubai, but did not play any of her new material. She was reportedly paid $24m (£19.4m) for the one-off show, but faced criticism for performing in a country where homosexuality and gender reassignment are outlawed.  Critics said that contradicted the message of her latest album, which explicitly celebrates black and queer dance culture.  Beyoncé conceived the album as ""a place to dream and to find escape"" during the pandemic, layering her songs with multiple samples and references to club music, from Nile Rodgers' Studio 54 disco grooves and Grace Jones' imperious soul, to less-celebrated movements like bounce and dancehall. Exclaim magazine called it ""the sound of a once-in-a-generation superstar performing at her peak"", while the Guardian described it as ""a breath-taking, maximalist tour de force"". Unusually, Beyoncé has avoided making music videos for the album, meaning the Renaissance tour will be fans' first chance to see her visual interpretation of tracks like Break My Soul, Alien Superstar and Cuff It. The former Destiny's Child star may reveal further details at this weekend's Grammys, where she is up for nine awards, including album of the year. The singer previously hinted at plans for a world tour in October, when she raffled tickets to a show during the fifth annual Wearable Art Gala. Images shared from the auction suggested the ""unique"" prize, valued at $20,000 (£16,200), included first-class plane tickets, a three-night hotel stay, two concert tickets and a guided backstage tour from Beyoncé's mother.

"Eurovision a major opportunity for Liverpool, minister says","Liverpool must do what it does best and ""show everyone how to party"" as it hosts Eurovision, a minister has said. Stuart Andrew, whose remit includes the contest, said he met business owners in the city ahead of last night's official handover ceremony and shared his hopes they could capitalise on it. The culture minister said it was ""a major opportunity"" for the city. Liverpool City Council's chief executive has called it a ""once in a decade"" chance to bring in investment. Mr Andrew said he would ""do all I can to maximise the benefits from it"". ""I was here recently for the World Gymnastics Championships and the feedback was incredible,"" he said. ""The city knows how to put on big events."" The government has not said how much money it will contribute to staging the contest, but Liverpool City Council and Liverpool City Region Combined Authority are to spend a combined £4m on the event. That money will include funding for an education programme for schools and young people and several new art commissions which are due to be unveiled in the next few weeks. The BBC and other European broadcasters will also be contributing.  The city council's chief executive Theresa Grant said it was a ""once in a decade"" opportunity to bring in investment and estimates put the potential value to the local economy at somewhere between £16m and £25m. City mayor Joanne Anderson has defended spending public money on the event.  She said the money the council was contributing will come ""from our culture budget"". The Labour mayor said the city ""put a cap on our bid and it was less than other cities"", but the area was ""already seeing the benefit"" and expected to see ""a multimillion-pound tourism boost over the next three years"". ""Our hospitality sector was battered during Covid,"" she said.  ""Bidding for this was a no brainer. Our visitor economy is our USP and we need to ensure that we maintain it.  ""That £2m investment will see a huge return [and] we are going to maximise the opportunity for future investment too."" However, not all of the city's politicians have been so enthusiastic.  Sam Gorst, the independent councillor for Cressington, said ""only big business will benefit"" from the spending. ""It won't filter down to Garston and Norris Green,"" he added. But Mr Andrew said the value to previous host cities had been made clear to him.  ""What we have learned from other host countries is the more you take advantage of hosting Eurovision, the more you get back,"" the Conservative said. ""Tourism rates goes up, visitor numbers go up, spending goes up, and that's what we want to see. ""This will showcase the Liverpool City Region to 100 million people.""

"Edinburgh Fringe only for the wealthy, says Richard Herring","The comedian Richard Herring has said he will not perform at this year's Edinburgh Fringe due to concerns that spiralling costs are pricing out audiences and performers. He said the high cost of accommodation in the city meant ""only people with a fair amount of wealth can attend"".  ""It should be for everyone, as it felt like it was back in 1987 when I first went there,"" added Herring in a blog.  City of Edinburgh Council and the Fringe have been asked for comment.  A slump in ticket sales for some Edinburgh Fringe shows last year was blamed on accommodation costs, train strikes and the cost of living.  And some performers stayed in tents or campervans as they could not afford to pay for somewhere to stay in the city.  Herring found fame in the 1990s with comedy partner Stewart Lee. They met at Oxford University before going on to create cult BBC sketch show Fist of Fun.  Herring now hosts a successful podcast, RHLSTP, in which he interviews comedians and celebrities.  A regular fixture in Edinburgh in August, he says he has performed at the Fringe 27 times over the last 35 years.  But in a recent blog, he said that although he was pleased with his show, he found last year's Fringe ""quite upsetting and stressful"".  He said he ultimately took the decision not to return to Edinburgh this summer for the sake of his mental health, but he also spoke about the festival as a whole.  Accommodation costs were prohibitively expensive and performers with smaller audiences were likely to end up in thousands of pounds worth of debt, he added.  ""It just felt wrong and I didn't like the atmosphere or the fact that the 18-year-old me would have been unable to attend under these conditions or at least have had to do so under even more unpleasant circumstances than sleeping on the floor of a Masonic Temple,"" Herring said.  Herring praised the Fringe for helping him improve his work, push his career forward, make friends and find others to work with. He said he still believes it is the best festival in the world and was ""responsible for so much that has been good in my life"". But he added: ""Being able to go back every year to improve and experiment has been key to the limited success that I have enjoyed. If we lost money we were likely to get a job from the Fringe that would pay back some or all of the debt.  ""Nowadays I just don't think it's possible for anyone without a rich mum and dad or means of their own to come back year after year and the explosion in the number of acts means the chances of it leading directly to more work are slim."" He called for action from the City of Edinburgh Council and Edinburgh Fringe bosses.  Herring is not the first comedian to highlight some of the problems of the festival.  In The Fringe, Fame and Me, Frankie Boyle - another Fringe regular - describes the festival as ""kind of an elitist festival"".  ""I always think of the Edinburgh Festival as being this very middle-class thing, as I think a lot of Scottish people do. But even middle class doesn't quite cover it.  ""A lot of these people, your standard fringe act, they'll have gone to public school, they'll have gone to Oxbridge.  ""If you've done that and then you get your own TV show or whatever it is, you're not in the middle of any kind of experience of the average British person, you're part of an elite."" New rules have recently come into force limiting the number of Airbnb-style lets in the city in a bid to tackle a housing shortage.  Landlords need planning permission to let out a property, which is not their main residence, as a short-term let.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-64484359
Troubled Redditch mental health unit cuts bed numbers,"A mental health unit in Redditch is to cut bed numbers temporarily due to ongoing safety problems. It follows reports of staff being assaulted at the troubled Hill Crest unit, on the Alexandra Hospital site. A Care Quality Commission (CQC) report into earlier concerns is due to be published next week. Herefordshire and Worcestershire Healthcare NHS Trust said it accepted standards were not at the level expected.  The BBC has been told of an incident where a cleaner was punched in the face by a patient and a nurse who went to her rescue had his leg stamped on and broken in two places. There was another assault on a member of staff last month, with the Unison trade union saying it had ""taken too long"" to address long-running problems on the unit. The father of one patient was so concerned about the care his daughter was receiving that he camped outside the building and refused to move. It is claimed three further members of staff have now resigned and others are on sick leave - leading to a lack of cover on the ward. Mike Wilson, from Unison, said he had received reports of multiple issues at the weekend and some staff had said they were ""not able to work here any more"". The NHS trust is to temporarily cut the number of patients from 18 to 10 to allow time to focus on quality of care on the ward and make the best use of the staff available. After the CQC inspection in July, it said it implemented a number of changes which helped stabilise the ward. But ongoing issues with low levels of nursing and healthcare staff meant some of the improvements were still not fully embedded, it added. The trust said it could not comment on specific incidents, but those that resulted in harm were taken seriously and subject to internal investigation. In a letter to staff, seen by the BBC, it said there had been challenges with staffing at Hill Crest for at least two years.  There was not the right mix between permanent and temporary staff to safely operate 18 beds, the letter added. It outlined the trust's plans to rebuild a stable Hill Crest team by encouraging secondments on to the ward and block-booking regular agency staff.  It also said a temporary quality improvement manager would be introduced to embed consistent clinical processes. The trust said it had seen a copy of the CQC's report before it was finalised and published. ""This process has not delayed the action taken by the trust. As soon as issues were raised by the CQC, we established a comprehensive action plan which was progressed immediately,"" a trust spokesperson said.  The CQC carried out an emergency inspection after an incident in July in which a patient had boiling water mixed with sugar, resulting in staff locking themselves in an office. There was a fire on the ward in August and there have also been reports of an alleged rape and a patient being able to abscond twice.  A BBC investigation also identified staff sleeping at work and an alleged bullying and sexually inappropriate culture on the ward. The CQC said it would publish its report into Hill Crest shortly.  It said the issues identified by the BBC had been reported to it and it was continuing to monitor the service. Mr Wilson, from Unison, said: ""It looks like the trust has finally responded and taken action. ""It's taken too long. We have been reporting to them for two years. This kind of action we would have expected last year, when [the BBC] ran the first story."" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Infected blood inquiry: Five things we have learned,"A long-running public inquiry into what has been called the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS will hear its final evidence on Friday. It is thought tens of thousands were infected with HIV and hepatitis between 1970 and 1991 after being given a contaminated drug or blood transfusion.  The inquiry, which started in 2018, has reviewed thousands of documents and heard testimony from 370 witnesses. It will publish its formal conclusions and recommendations in the summer. Here are five important things that have been revealed by the inquiry over the past five years.  A group of academics hired by the inquiry produced detailed estimates of the numbers infected in the 1970s and 80s.  A total of 1,250 people with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders contracted HIV after being given a protein made from blood plasma known as Factor VIII. About half of that group later died of an Aids-related illness. At the time, the UK was not self-sufficient in Factor VIII, so it was often imported from the United States - where prisoners and other at-risk groups were paid to donate.  Another 30,000 NHS patients probably contracted a different virus - hepatitis C - through the same contaminated treatment, or a blood transfusion after surgery or childbirth. It is thought about 2,050 of that group later died of liver failure or cancer caused by hepatitis C, before an effective treatment became widely available. Researchers found that 380 of those infected with HIV - about one in three - were children, including some very young toddlers. When that figure was read out at the public inquiry, there was an audible gasp from survivors and relatives in the room. At Treloar's College, a state-run boarding school in Hampshire, 72 pupils - all haemophiliacs - later died after being given the contaminated treatment. The inquiry heard devastating testimony from survivors in a week of special hearings about the school. ""I often just think, why me? Why am I still here?"" said Richard Warwick, a former pupil who was infected with HIV as a young boy in 1978.  ""It's just the guilt of losing all those friends. I can name 10 that I know who are just gone. It's horrific."" One of the key questions the inquiry will now have to answer is whether more could and should have been done to prevent those infections and deaths. Former Prime Minister Sir John Major drew more gasps from families watching his testimony when he described the scandal as ""bad luck"". He later apologised for his choice of language. The inquiry was shown a letter written in May 1983 by Dr Spence Galbraith, then director of the UK's Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, to the Department of Health.  It warned that haemophiliacs were being infected with Aids and concluded that ""all products made from blood donated in the USA... should be withdrawn"". There was no evidence the letter was acted on at the time.  In his testimony, Lord John Patten, a junior health minister from 1983 to 1985, said he ""unequivocally"" believed ministers should have been told about the warning and said - if he had - he ""would have pressed the panic button"". There was detailed questioning of ministers and civil servants about the internal workings of government. Former Conservative health secretary Jeremy Hunt - now chancellor - was asked about official briefings he received as recently as 2012 suggesting the scandal had been an ""unavoidable problem"".  He described how state institutions can ""close ranks around a lie"" and said it was a ""huge failure of democracy"" that it has taken so long to get to the truth.  Another ex-health secretary Andy Burnham, now the Labour mayor of Manchester, said successive governments had ""comprehensively failed"" the victims over five decades and suggested there may be a case for charges of corporate manslaughter in the future. Hundreds of victims of the scandal have received annual support payments but - before this inquiry - no formal compensation had ever been awarded for loss of earnings, care costs and other lifetime losses. Many of those infected had had to give up jobs and live on benefits because of a series of health problems.  In July 2022, inquiry chairman Sir Brian Langstaff made his first formal recommendation - an unusual move in the middle of a public inquiry.  He said there was a ""compelling case"" to quickly make some interim compensation payments of £100,000 each.  The government agreed and - in October 2022 - the first payments were made to about 4,000 surviving victims and widows.  But many children, siblings and parents of those who had died have missed out.  That included Laura Palmer, 39, who lost both her parents to HIV/Aids in August 1993, when she was nine years old.  ""There are still a lot of bereaved families excluded, so there is more work for us to do,"" she told the BBC. Further recommendations on compensation are expected when the inquiry publishes its final report, which is likely to be around the middle of the year.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-64497868
HMP Eastwood Park: women held in bloodstained cells,"Female prisoners with mental health conditions are being held in cells with bloodstains and scratches on the walls, a watchdog has found. HMP Eastwood Park in South Gloucestershire has been given the lowest grade for safety. Chief inspector of prisons, Charlie Taylor said an inspector described conditions as the ""worst he had ever seen"" after an inspection last October. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said the report was ""deeply concerning"". An MoJ spokesperson said: ""We are already addressing the serious issues it raises including appointing more staff and creating a new taskforce to improve women's safety at the prison."" Inspectors raised particular concerns about unit 4, a block which holds those under supervision, in segregation or awaiting transfer to a secure mental health facility. Cells on the wing were described as ""appalling, dilapidated and covered in graffiti"", one was blood-splattered and some had extensive scratches on the walls. The watchdog said this showed ""distress"" and the ""degree of trauma"" experienced by previous inmates. The MoJ said that refurbishments to unit 4 have been undertaken and have ""restored the specialist, therapeutic support that inspectors expect for the vulnerable women in our care there"". The report also said 83% of the 348 women held at the prison during the time of inspection reported having mental health problems. It said inspectors found high levels of self-harm among the prisoners but case documents to support those at risk of self-harm and suicide were ""very poor"". Inspectors found the use of force had increased since their last inspection and said the prison was ""fundamentally unequipped to support the women in its care"", adding that ""leaders did not seem fully aware of the severity of the situation"". Mr Taylor, said: ""Some of the most vulnerable women across the prison estate were held in an environment wholly unsuitable for their therapeutic needs. ""The levels of distress we observed were appalling. No prisoner should be held in such terrible conditions.""  Mr Taylor said he was ""deeply concerned"" about the welfare of the ""dedicated and courageous"" staff on unit 4, saying they ""were not adequately trained or qualified"" to look after the women in their care. He said staff received no clinical supervision, despite being ""exposed to prisoners in great distress"" and extreme levels of self-harm. Prisoners were also often unable to attend education, skills and work activities because of staff shortages. Inspectors said while there were some ""pockets of excellent work"" at the prison, the jail was ""failing in its most basic duty"" of keeping women safe and required ""immediate and meaningful change"".

Stem cell donor meets US woman he saved,"A stem cell donor from London has said it was ""emotional"" to meet the woman whose life he helped to save. Callum Kennedy-Mann flew to Pennsylvania in the US to meet Diane Fargo at the end of 2022.  His stem cell donation helped to treat the aggressive form of leukaemia she had been suffering with. Ms Fargo described the 22-year-old lifeguard from Stoke Newington as her ""guardian angel"".  Mr Kennedy-Mann was surprised to receive a call that he was a genetic match with Ms Fargo while he was studying at York University in 2019. He had forgotten that he had signed up to the stem cell register put together by Anthony Nolan - a charity helping those with blood cancer - when he was 16. ""I didn't hesitate in saying I'd do it after they told me I was the best possible match,"" Mr Kennedy-Mann said. ""It was instinctive for me, knowing I could have a huge impact on someone's life."" Two years after the donation he heard that Ms Fargo was recovering well from the treatment. ""That was the most emotional moment for me — receiving a letter telling me she was alive,"" Mr Kennedy-Mann said. The pair met when Ms Fargo offered Mr Kennedy-Mann and his girlfriend the chance to travel to the US and they spent Thanksgiving together. Mr Kennedy said meeting Ms Fargo was ""so natural"". ""I felt like I already knew her, and we didn't feel like strangers at all,"" he said. Ms Fargo said: ""Callum is my guardian angel and to have the opportunity to host him and his girlfriend over Thanksgiving holiday was a true blessing."" She added: ""I am so thankful for Anthony Nolan and will be forever grateful to Callum for his kind and selfless sacrifice."" Anthony Nolan Chief executive Henny Braund said that men under 30 were 13 times more likely to be selected for donation in the UK, and called for more young men to sign up. The charity also urged those from a minority ethnic background to register.  Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Infected blood inquiry: Son 'will never come to terms' with scandal,"A man who led calls for an inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal has said he will never come to terms with the events that caused his father's death.  Jason Evans was four years old when his dad Jonathan died in 1993, having contracted both HIV and hepatitis C at the Oxford Haemophilia Centre.  Mr Evans founded campaign group Factor 8 and successfully lobbied the government for a full public inquiry.  The inquiry began in 2018 and he spoke to the BBC to mark its conclusion. Mr Evans' father was among thousands of people to be infected by contaminated blood in the 1970s and '80s after being given a blood clotting agent called factor VIII.  At the time, the medication was imported from the US where it was made from the pooled blood plasma of thousands of paid donors, including some in high-risk groups, such as prisoners. If a single donor was infected with a blood-borne virus such as hepatitis or HIV then the whole batch of medication could be contaminated. Official documents presented to the inquiry revealed this therapy was given as part of clinical trials. Mr Evans, who lives in Coventry, said he still found it difficult to accept that his father and the others infected were tested unwittingly as part of experiments.  ""It's something I don't think I'll ever come to terms with,"" he said.  ""That whole area of people being used as research subjects to study the transmission of hepatitis through these blood products without their consent, without their knowledge, is just crazy. ""Something that I think about all the time is that the majority of people infected with hepatitis C and HIV are dead so most of the people this inquiry is really about - or a large proportion of them - aren't here."" The inquiry was set up to examine: Mr Evans said the death of his father and others had been ""completely avoidable"".  He added: ""Pharmaceutical companies skipped safety steps for reason of cost, and more importance was given to convenience than safety. ""I do believe ultimately that's what this scandal almost entirely comes down to."" Mr Evans said he hoped the recommendations made after the inquiry would be implemented immediately, but feared the campaign might just be entering its ""next phase"".   The report by the inquiry's chair, Sir Brian Langstaff, is expected this summer. It will then be down to the government, which gave interim payments of £100,000 to about 4,000 victims last year, to act on his recommendations.  Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Colchester Hospital 'not always safe' due to national shortage,"A major hospital did not always have enough medical staff to keep patients safe because of national shortages, inspectors have said. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) dropped its rating for medical care services at Colchester Hospital from ""good"" to ""requires improvement"". There was an 8.6% vacancy rate and 6.25% sickness rate in its medical care services in October 2022. The hospital said it had already acted on the CQC recommendations. ""The service's staffing arrangements weren't always sufficient to meet the needs of people using it,"" said Antoinette Smith, the CQC's head of hospital inspection in the East of England. ""The East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust (ESNEFT) must find ways to prevent this compromising the care it provides."" Inspectors visited six of the hospital medical care wards on 3 November last year after receiving ""concerning"" information about safety and treatment. While the rating for medical care dropped down, the overall rating for the hospital, and the ESNEFT, remained at ""requires improvement"". The report referenced ""national shortages of nursing and support staff and elevated levels of staff absence"" which meant ""the division did not always have enough staff to keep patients safe"". Inspectors noted there was an ongoing recruitment campaign at Colchester. A report by MPs last year warned England was short of 12,000 hospital doctors and more than 50,000 nurses and midwives. The most recent data showed a 9.7% vacancy rate across NHS England. The Colchester inspection found staff did not always ""effectively"" communicate discharge information; did not always comply with infection control; and that patient records were not always stored securely. There were four incidents of clostridioides difficile infection on one ward in October, inspectors said. Ms Smith said ESNEFT must ensure staff complete all required training and improve infection control. ESNEFT chief nurse Dr Giles Thorpe said his team welcomed the report and was already ""putting in place many of the recommendations"". ""Like all NHS Trusts throughout the country, our staff have been managing many pressures and I am very grateful for all of their hard work,"" he added.

Sunderland South Tyneside hospitals medical care require improvement,"Medical care at two Tyneside hospitals and a maternity ward need improvement, inspectors have found. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) visited Sunderland Royal and South Tyneside District Hospitals in June and August and found a number of areas health bosses must act on.  The CQC said it visited after receiving ""concerns"" about safety and quality. The South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust said improvements were being made after a ""tough"" time. The CQC downgraded the trust's overall rating from good to requires improvement after the summer visits, as well giving the same rating for maternity services at Sunderland. Sarah Dronsfield, CQC deputy director of operations in the North, said there were particular concerns about patient safety and the ""management of risk"" in June. During the August visit, inspectors found some improvements had been made but the trust ""had not addressed all of the areas of concern which resulted in continued breaches of several regulations"". Ms Dronsfield said further breaches of regulation were also identified and the trust would be monitored. Problems included: A trust spokeswoman said the CQC had ""highlighted the very challenging"" staffing position among nurses and midwives which followed a ""very difficult time"" managing the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and ""unrelenting pressure on NHS services"". She also said staff were given a good rating for their caring and patients said staff treated them ""well and with kindness"". Trust chief executive Ken Bremner said: ""There is no doubt that the past two years has been incredibly tough but there can be no excuses.   ""Our vision is for 'excellence in all that we do' and this shows we still have work to do."" Allison Thompson, who became the trust chairperson in April 2022, said she knew the rating would be ""disappointing"" for staff but ""we absolutely learn the lessons from this CQC report as we move forward"".

'A blood test saved my life' says young cancer patient,"""A simple blood test saved my life,"" Nella Pignatelli tells the BBC, and she wants others to have one too if they don't feel right. Nella, 24, was diagnosed with leukaemia 18 months ago after feeling fatigued and out of breath when walking, something she passed off as long Covid. ""I started a new job and just felt really tired all the time, but I associated everything that was happening to me with things that were going on in my life,"" she says. ""When I had two nosebleeds that lasted an hour - it had got to the point that after three months of dealing with the symptoms, I was losing my mind."" According to the charity Teenage Cancer Trust, 56% of those aged 18-24 would not know what five signs and symptoms they should look out for. The most recognisable ones within this age group are: Half of the 2,000 people surveyed also admitted they'd put off going to the GP with health concerns, with many saying it was because they were too scared to find out what was wrong with them.  Other reasons given included it being too difficult to get an appointment and fears that they were wasting their GP's time. Nella went to her GP for a blood test, followed by a bone marrow test, which revealed she had acute leukaemia and needed immediate chemotherapy. Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Acute leukaemia means it progresses quickly and aggressively, and usually requires immediate treatment. ""You know your body better than anyone - I regret not seeking help sooner, because it would have meant I could have been treated quicker,"" she says. Lauren Aneesa Angrish also didn't know what the main things are to look out for when it comes to identifying cancer. The 25-year-old also put feeling fatigued and getting coughs and colds regularly down to her ""busy life"". ""I originally thought I'm just overworked and need to take a holiday,"" she tells the BBC. Working as a make-up artist, she got free spray tans at work, and thought they might be the reason she had started to develop a rash. ""I stopped tanning and the rash got even worse, it started on my legs and then it was literally all over my body - on my eyelids and face,"" she says. Lauren tried a course of steroids to remove the rash, but it continued to get worse so she went to A&E and asked for a blood test. The next day she was contacted and later diagnosed with acute leukaemia, for which she had to undergo treatment including a stem cell transplant.  Like Nella, Lauren also wants to encourage people who are worried to book an appointment with their GP. ""Any health issue, any worry - even a little mole that's changed colour, I'd say don't stress about it or worry, just make sure to go check on it."" Teenage Cancer Trust's chief nurse, Dr Louise Soanes, says: ""It can be scary to think about cancer, particularly if you're a young person, but it can happen to anyone of any age.    ""Always listen to your body and if you have concerns never be afraid to seek help - the likelihood is that is isn't cancer, but it's always best to check.""   There are thought to be around 2,400 new cancer cases in young people every year in the UK, but that accounts for less than 1% of all new cases.  These findings from the Teenage Cancer Trust come at a time when cancer diagnoses are rising, with projections showing that the number of people diagnosed with cancer will rise by a third by 2040. Analysis by Cancer Research UK finds that, if current trends continue, cancer cases will rise from the 384,000 cases per year now to 506,000 in 2040. Most of the rise is thought to be due to an ageing population because older people are more likely to get cancer. However, smoking and obesity are also contributing to the rise and are the two biggest preventable causes of cancer, says the charity.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-64505734
Congleton mum's brain tumour detected week after baby born,"A newborn baby has been credited with saving his mum's life after a brain tumour was found a week after she gave birth. Abi Naylor, 28, from Congleton, Cheshire, thought her migraines were down to life with a new baby.  When they became ""excruciating"" she was admitted to hospital and operated on within 48 hours. Doctors said the tumour may have gone undetected had it not grown due to pregnancy stress and hormones. After going through the ordeal in October 2022, Mrs Naylor said she and her husband Ross, along with baby Roman, are now ""just trying to be a normal family"". Mrs Naylor said she first noticed a headache when her son was a week old. ""I just thought it was from sleepless nights and breastfeeding...since puberty I've always suffered from migraines so just thought this must be a whopping one,"" she said. Days later, Mrs Naylor went to an out-of-hours doctors where she was told it was probably side effects from having an epidural during labour, but was told to go to A&E to have a scan and get painkillers. Mrs Naylor said things started to get worse and when she woke up the next day she ""couldn't walk or use my right side"". After a ten-hour wait in A&E, Mrs Naylor said she was eventually given a scan which showed she had a 2.75in (7cm) brain tumour. ""You have doctors telling you what they are going to do next with scans, but you don't hear any of that,"" she said.  ""I just thought I'm not going to see my husband or see my baby grow up,"" she said. After being taken to Salford Royal Hospital by ambulance for MRI scans, Mrs Naylor was then told she needed the tumour removed as soon as possible. ""It was a whirlwind,"" she said. Mrs Naylor said she also owes a lot to her husband. ""With a newborn he was doing the night feed while looking after me and having a really positive mindset. He is just the most incredible man I've ever met,"" she said. Mrs Naylor said all her scans have now come back clear and that she is recovering well.

North East Ambulance Service medical and safety directors resign,"Two directors at an ambulance service that recently received a damning inspection report have resigned. Medical director Dr Matthew Beattie left the North East Ambulance Service (NEAS) on 31 January after a six-month notice period. Quality and safety director Sarah Rushbrooke was given a new job with a neighbouring trust in September and leaves NEAS at the end of February. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) has rated NEAS' urgent care ""inadequate"". The loss of the two directors comes as a CQC report said crews frequently responded to emergencies without access to life-saving drugs. The report, published earlier this week, concluded patients had been potentially placed ""at risk"" by the poor management of medicines. In response to the CQC's findings, NEAS said it had faced a year of ""unprecedented pressures"". The report comes after a whistleblower raised concerns last year that NEAS had covered up mistakes by paramedics following the deaths of patients. The trust faced allegations it withheld details from coroners in more than 90 cases between 2018 and 2019.  Paul Calvert, the NEAS coroner's officer who raised the concerns, said a full public inquiry was needed. The government said the NHS would be holding a full independent review, something NEAS said it would ""welcome independent scrutiny"". A spokesperson for NEAS said Dr Beattie gave notice six months ago and left the service on 31 January to take up a new role and would be replaced by Dr Kat Noble. Ms Rushbrooke was appointed to a new job in a neighbouring trust in September last year and would be replaced by NHS lead nurse Julia Young at the end of February, they said. The exact circumstances surrounding the departures are not known and the BBC has no evidence suggesting they are linked to the recent failings at the trust.

Isle of Man hospital patients stay in A&E due to lack of space,"A lack of bed space at the Isle of Man's main hospital meant some patients had to spend a night in A&E, Manx Care has said.  Noble's Hospital was running at full capacity on Tuesday, meaning some people waiting to be admitted were kept in rooms at the emergency department.  A Manx Care spokeswoman said the situation had eased but admissions remained high. Efforts were underway to cut delays in discharging, she added. Lack of bed space due to high rates of winter illness has continued to disrupt care at the island's main hospital, as health services struggle to move patients out to other care facilities.  Manx Care said many of those arriving at A&E were frail, elderly patients who were ""likely to have an extended length of stay in hospital"". Pressures across the whole social care system meant home, residential and nursing care providers cannot care for patients as soon as they are ready to be discharged, the spokeswoman added. System-wide ways to tackle the problem are being investigated, Manx Care said.   Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and Twitter?

Plaid Cymru calls for income tax rises for NHS pay,"People in Wales should pay more in income tax in order to help Wales through an ""unprecedented crisis"", according to Plaid Cymru. The party is calling for a 1p in the pound increase for people earning over £12,500, a 2p rise for salaries of over £50,000, and an extra 3p for those bringing in more than £150,000. It says the extra cash can go on NHS and social care pay. But the Welsh government has rejected the idea. It said raising the basic rate of tax would hit ""many who are already struggling with rising inflation"". Meanwhile the Conservatives said Plaid could ""stop propping"" up the Welsh government if they really lacked faith in Labour ministers. Plaid Cymru is calling for the income tax rises and cost-of-living measures to be added to the Welsh government's budget for the next financial year, 2023-2024. The party proposes using the extra cash raised to fund an 8% increase next year for NHS staff and paying social care workers £12 an hour. But if the proposals are rejected then Plaid will not vote against the draft budget when it is debated in the Senedd on Tuesday. Their abstention - part of the party's co-operation agreement with the Labour Welsh government - will allow the budget to pass. In December, the Welsh government unveiled its £20bn budget, which will see an increase in NHS funding but no income tax rises. The Welsh government has had some income tax powers since 2019, but has never used them.  Ministers can adjust the basic rate, higher rate and additional rate by 10p in every £1, but do not have powers over the thresholds at which people pay the different rates. Plaid Cymru is calling for a 1p rise in the basic rate, a 2p increase in the higher rate, and a 3p hike in the additional rate. Official estimates suggest it would raise an extra £312m for the Welsh government. Plaid is proposing to use the extra cash raised to fund a £317m package of measures, including an 8% pay increase next year for NHS workers, a rise in the minimum wage for social care workers to £12 an hour, and a mortgage rescue scheme. It says the cash could also be used for a 'Welsh Solidarity Fund"" that could be used to extend free school meals for secondary school pupils in receipt of benefits, to increase the Education Maintenance Allowance for students, or help people struggling to pay their mortgages. Plaid Cymru's leader Adam Price said the Welsh government has been short-changed by Westminster but ministers in Cardiff were ""not powerless"" to act. Mr Price said: ""An unprecedented crisis calls for genuine solutions. ""Our NHS is in crisis. Waiting times are at an all-time high, patients are trapped waiting for treatment and diagnosis and the legacy of over a decade of real-term cuts to wages has led doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals to the picket line or to leave the profession entirely. ""And, of course, it's not just the NHS - workers everywhere are on strike for fairer pay and better work conditions.  ""The economic crisis has left households across Wales unable to put food on the table. This is what 13 years of Tory cuts and 25 years of Labour mismanagement has done to our communities."" Last autumn, a majority of Plaid Cymru's Senedd members voted for a 4p increase in the higher rate and a 5p rise in the additional rate, but the idea was never formally announced. A Welsh government spokesman said: ""Now is not the right time to raise the basic rate of income tax as it would hurt many who are already struggling with rising inflation and higher energy bills.  ""Increasing the higher and additional rates of income tax in the way Plaid Cymru are proposing would only raise £75m - the bulk of the revenue raised under these proposals would come from basic rate tax payers in Wales. ""In line with our commitment not to take more in Welsh rates of income tax from people for at least as long as the economic impact of Covid-19 lasts, we are proposing no change to any of the current rates for Welsh rates of income tax for 2023-24."" Conservative leader in the Welsh Parliament Andrew RT Davies said: ""Plaid Cymru's so-called ""co-operation agreement"" with Labour is a coalition in all but name. If they really lacked faith in Labour ministers in the Senedd, they would stop propping them up.  ""Instead, they're trying to have all the good things of government without taking responsibility. The result is typical voodoo economics from Plaid, trying to spend the same pound twice. ""Under the UK Conservative government, Wales gets £1.20 for every £1 spent in England. The money is there but Labour and Plaid mismanagement is short-changing Wales and our NHS."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-64497838
Urgent 999 plea as biggest strike action days looms,"North West Ambulance Service has urged people to only call 999 in life-threatening emergencies as the NHS's biggest day of strike action looms. Members of unions Unite, GMB and the Royal College of Nurses (RCN) will all walk out over pay on Monday.  Further disruption is expected with strikes from the RCN on Tuesday and Unison members on 10 February.  NWAS pleaded with people to ""use the NHS wisely"" with hospital resources seriously stretched.  Ambulance workers are to join nurses in strike action on Friday in England and Wales in what will be the biggest NHS walkout in the dispute. The RCN is calling for a 19% pay rise, although the union has indicated it may meet the government ""half way"". Unions representing ambulance workers also want above-inflation pay rises, but have not specified a figure. The government says the demands are unaffordable and pay rises must always be decided by independent pay review bodies. NWAS said ambulances will be limited on Friday and Monday, with fewer staff in call centres and patient transport services.  Ged Blezard, director of operations, said: ""It's vital we keep the ambulances we do have available for those who really need us. ""Reasons to continue to call 999 include cardiac arrest, loss of consciousness, fits that aren't stopping, breathing difficulties, severe bleeding, allergic reactions and serious head injuries."" He said other patients who require hospital treatment will likely be asked to take alternative transport and urged people not to call 999 to check on ambulance arrival times. ""I am pleased to say the public has listened to our previous messages and call volumes have fallen on days of strike action,"" Mr Blezard added.  Those with non-urgent concerns are advised to seek help from NHS 111 or contact their GP or pharmacist. Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Alice Litman: Inquest to be held into death of transgender woman,"An inquest is to be held into the death of a transgender woman who took her own life while on an NHS waiting list. Assistant coroner Sarah Clarke will examine issues relating to the death of Alice Litman, from Brighton, who waited almost three years for gender-affirming healthcare. Ms Clarke recently held a pre-inquest review. The Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust said it was ""deeply saddened"" by Ms Litman's death. Ms Litman was 16 when she told her family she wanted to live as a woman. She had been referred to the NHS Gender Identity Development Service in August 2019, but was still waiting for an initial assessment when she took her own life at the age of 20. Ms Litman's family are hoping her inquest, due to take place in September, will examine the issue of accessibility to NHS treatment for ""vulnerable trans people"". They said in a statement: ""We believe that Alice died partly because of the inaccessibility of gender-affirming healthcare in the UK. ""We want the inquest to examine this to ensure we can get justice for Alice, and change for all the trans people who are facing the same issues."" Ms Litman's father, Peter, said: ""It's not just Alice. It's too late for her. ""There are lots of other young transgender people out there and they need our help."" The Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, to which Ms Litman had been referred, said: ""We are deeply saddened to learn of the death of a patient who was waiting to be seen at the Gender Identity Clinic, but it is not appropriate to comment while the inquest is ongoing.""

"Nottingham maternity families face a brick wall, review team told","Families have told a senior midwife who is leading a review into failings at a city's NHS maternity units there is a ""brick wall"" when communicating with a hospital trust. Donna Ockenden is examining how dozens of babies died or were injured at the Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) trust. She met the trust at a formal meeting on Thursday. NUH said it would make ""necessary and sustainable improvements"". Ms Ockenden previously led an inquiry into the UK's biggest maternity scandal at Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust. She met the chief executive of NUH, Anthony May, and other members of the trust's executive team. Ms Ockenden said the meeting had been ""positive"".  ""Families are still saying to me that they have felt very recently, that there is a brick wall with the trust - that they're not able to get their concerns heard - these are families within the past six months,"" she said. ""The communication is often not timely enough. We specifically talked about how the trust is going to look at improving the way that they engage with families when something's gone wrong. ""So the trust listened very carefully and by the next meeting they're going to have fed back to us how they're going to look at improving communication with families."" Meanwhile, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in the House of Commons that more must be done to improve maternity care, after hearing from an MP about a baby who died at the trust. Mr Sunak expressed condolences and said: ""We want to make sure that the NHS is the best and safest place in the world to give birth, and the NHS has taken steps to improve. ""But... more must be done."" He outlined the steps being taken in Nottingham and nationally, saying: ""But my honourable friend is absolutely right, when situations like this do arise, transparency is paramount so we can seek answers and make improvements."" According to latest figures, 949 families have contacted the review, while the total number of staff stands at 411. When the review launched, in September 2022, Ms Ockenden said she expected it would take about 18 months. In December 2020, the trust's maternity services were rated inadequate with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) finding ""several serious concerns"". Anthony May, chief executive at the trust, said: ""We are committed to making the necessary and sustainable improvements to our maternity services and continue to engage fully and openly with Donna Ockenden and her team on their independent review.  ""We are not waiting for the review to conclude before making changes and our staff have been working hard to make the necessary improvements now.  ""Crucial to these improvements is ensuring that family voices are heard and we are encouraging people who have significant or serious concerns about their maternity care to contact the review team. ""We are also encouraging current and former staff who work directly in or closely with our maternity services, to come forward and engage with the review.  ""We know that this is an unsettling time for women and families using our maternity services. Local women and families can be confident that the teams responsible for their care are totally committed to providing the safest and best experience possible.

International Garden Photographer of the Year competition 2023,"Tony North has been named winner of this year's International Garden Photographer of the Year competition. His picture was taken in the island of La Palma, which is part of the Canary Islands. It is entitled Blue Tajinaste and also won first place in the Breathing Spaces section of the competition.  North achieved the final image by combining two different exposures; one of the sky and one of the foreground. ""Tony North has literally elevated the Breathing Spaces category to new heights, by photographing endemic mountain-top flora with a breathtaking landscape view - well-framed to include many points of interest,"" said head judge Tyrone McGlinchey.  ""This photograph excels in highlighting plant life on our planet."" This picture was also awarded the Threatened Plants Photographic Award. ""Echium gentianoides is rare, being confined to La Palma in the Canary Islands, and classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as vulnerable due to browsing and predation by goats and other invasive species,"" says Dr Paul P Smith, Secretary General, Botanic Gardens Conservation International. Here are the winning photographs from the other categories. Barry Webb was awarded first place in the Portfolios section and a Gold Medal from the Royal Photographic Society. His series of pictures captures the beauty and diversity of slime moulds, each one made up of many images stacked on each other.   Gigi Williams' photograph of the Namib Desert in Namibia was awarded first place in the Plants and Planets category. ""I took this photo in the Namib Desert, which is home to some of the highest sand dunes in the world; this one was particularly impressive with the tiny trees growing happily at the bottom. It is amazing where plants can grow and how life adapts,"" says Williams. Fallen Orchid Flowers by Claire Carter won the Beauty of Plants category.  ""I captured these dead orchid flowers, after they had dropped, when they started to dry and take on a wonderful, paper-like texture,"" says Carter.  ""To complement this, I added the background texture layer in post-processing."" The Wildlife in the Garden category was won by Gianluca Benini. His picture, Cinciarella, was taken at the Castelnuovo del Garda in Verona, Italy. ""After several attempts, I managed to capture the exact moment when the blue tit (cinciarella in Italian), took flight from the sunflower head,"" says Benini.  ""I am used to placing dried sunflowers in the garden to feed the various bird species that visit me in winter."" Heather and Bracken by Mark Bauer was taken in the New Forest in Hampshire and won the Wildflower Landscapes category.  ""This area of heathland near Burley in the New Forest is particularly photogenic in late August, when there is an extensive carpet of heather on the gentle slopes,"" says Bauer.  ""I found a section which was broken up by bracken, just starting to turn into golden hues. A lone tree in the distance made a natural focal point, with the hills behind it receding into the light mist."" Abandon Hope by David Townshend was inspired by a line from Dante's The Divine Comedy.  ""I see circles within circles of Dante's Inferno, which I created from a bug hotel in my garden using in-camera image blending,"" says Townshend. The Beautiful Garden category was won by Caroline Piek.  Her picture shows The Stream Garden in Waspik, the Netherlands,  an immersive naturalistic garden. The World of Fungi category was awarded to Jay Birmingham for his picture entitled Autumn Emergence, which was taken in Monks Park Wood, Warwickshire. ""I came across this honey fungus in my local woodland, just as the sun was rising and lighting up the woods with golden hues,"" says Birmingham.  ""The bonus was the bracken behind - which gave the picture a wonderfully warm autumnal feel. I captured using a wide aperture, to isolate the subject, and to maximise the bokeh background, I also used focus stacking in post-processing.""

Shropshire veteran back in military family after lesbian sacking,"A veteran who was dismissed from the Armed Forces for being a lesbian said charities had helped welcome her ""back to the military family"". Jean Macdonald was a lance corporal in the Women's Royal Army Corps when she was dismissed in 1981.  ""Witch hunts"" to eradicate anyone gay were ""quite terrifying"" at the time, said the 66-year-old from Shropshire, who said she was ""interrogated"". ""You join at a very young age and maybe don't know your sexuality,"" she added. Gay people and other members of the LGBT community were not allowed to serve in the military until a rule change in 2000.  She said ""everything was looking up"" in her military career and was due for a promotion when one day she was called up by members of the Specialist Intelligence Branch, who told her it was their belief she was a lesbian.  ""'We're going to find you out', they said, and they marched me down to my room and I had to stand there while they ransacked my room. ""They took my Tina Turner poster because they said that meant I was gay, because I liked Tina Turner.   ""They took my pyjamas, they said they were men's, they took letters, photographs, it was almost like you had lesbian written on your forehead."" Looking back, she said, the services were ""totally homophobic"". Last year she and other veterans who had requested documents about investigations and interrogations by military police were told the files were deleted in 2010. A search of the service police database produced only one document in relation to her dismissal, reading: ""Conducting oneself disgracefully - unnatural act.""  An independent review looking at how the Armed Forces dealt with members of the LGBT community, thought to have affected more than 5,000 people, is set to report back in May.  ""All of a sudden, you've lost your career, your love and your pride of serving your country,"" she said, adding there was ""no support whatsoever"". Finding the episode traumatising, it resulted in years of mental health difficulties leading to a diagnosis of complex PTSD. She said she found little help in the intervening 40 years and hadn't approached veterans' charities for ""fear of being turned away"".  But after connecting with other LGBT veterans through the charities Fighting with Pride and Salute Her in the past 18 months she had ""reclaimed her veteran status."" The help and interaction had given her confidence ""and hope for the future"", she said.  ""I wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for their help,"" she said.  She had attended services at the Cenotaph in 2021 and 2022 with charity Fighting with Pride, the only two where LGBT veterans had been allowed.

""I hold the camera up and look through the viewfinder and all of a sudden the world doesn't seem such a scary place, it's just being in that moment,"" she said.  The MoD has previously said ""historical policy prohibiting homosexuality in the Armed Forces was abhorrent"". The spokesman added: ""We deeply regret LGBT+ members serving in defence suffered injustice as a consequence. Our priority now is to understand the full impact of the historic ban and find appropriate ways to address the wrongs of the past.  ""The policy followed at the time was to remove references to these former offences and investigations from service records. There was a legal duty to ensure these records were erased from individuals service records."" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Photo exhibition celebrates 1985 youth,"Photographs taken in 1985 of ""dynamic"" young people have gone on show in an exhibition.The pictures were captured in Peterborough by photographer Russell Boyce, who was 23 at the time.Titled New Town Youth 1985, it features various youth groups from the city.Mr Boyce said of the pictures: ""Some are hopeful and positive, some are tougher subjects like homelessness and unemployment."" It took a year to complete the photography project in 1985 and the exhibition at Peterborough Museum and Art Gallery is the first time all the work has been shown together.Mr Boyce said: ""It was special for me because I was fresh out of college, I was desperate to shoot pictures in the community I was living in, and it offered so many different opportunities.""Wherever I went there were great pictures to be had.""The photographer described 1985 as a ""difficult"" time.""The job market was very tough in that era as well, Britain was coming out of a recession,"" he said. Mr Boyce said the exhibition was called ""New Town Youth"" because Peterborough ""was a new town, it had that feel about it"".""People were dynamic, engaged and wanted to get on with their lives,"" he said.Since the exhibition opened he said he had received plenty of positive feedback and visitors were ""intrigued by the haircuts"" in the pictures.The exhibition runs until 16 April at Peterborough Museum and Art Gallery.

Walsall photographer showcases pre-war life in Ukraine,"A photographer from the West Midlands is compiling a book of photos taken three decades ago that document daily life in 1990s Ukraine.  Former Foreign Office diplomat Peter Ford is self-financing the book, with proceeds from sales going to charity. The 300-picture collection, due for release in several weeks, will be called ""Kyiv - Moments in Time"". ""These people I worked with are suffering [in war today]. I just thought 'what can I do'?"" Mr Ford said. The photos span a period of three years between 1996 and 1999, when Mr Ford, from Walsall, was based in Ukraine's capital. He was working for the Foreign Office while also freelancing as a photographer for news agency Associated Press (AP). The introduction to his book, written by former AP colleague Efrem Lukatsky, described the ""huge in stature"" photographer as a ""conspicuous"" and memorable figure on the city's streets. ""Little has been preserved in photographs of that period of Ukrainian life, and Peter's works are an invaluable contribution to the history of Ukraine,"" Mr Lukatsky wrote. The pictures were still discussed in photography circles in Kyiv, he added.  Mr Ford said the photos ""document a period of life"" when people played chess in bathing costumes in the open air, and music conservatoire students performed in the metro.  ""No-one's on the street, there's no celebrations or going out - there'll be no one out on the streets playing chess,"" he said of Ukraine today. ""The juxtaposition between their friendliness and warmth and the friendship I got from them and what's happening to them is just too much for me to contemplate."" Mr Ford has since retired from the Foreign Office but still works as a photographer, and has covered events and sporting fixtures worldwide. He is still in touch with friends in Ukraine and hopes a copy of the book will be delivered to Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko, whose boxer brother Wladimir appears in the pictures. Profits will go to Rotary Club of Walsall to help deliver medicine to Ukraine. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Photography exhibition to show life in apartheid South Africa,"An exhibition of pictures showing apartheid-era South Africa is to open at Leicester Museum and Art Gallery. The exhibition, entitled South Africa in the 1970s: Photographs by Steve Bloom, will showcase historical photos which had been abandoned in an attic for decades. The touring display will be the first time the pictures, by renowned photographer Steve Bloom, have been shown in the region. It runs from 4 February until 14 May. South Africa's apartheid system of enforced racial segregation was in place from the late 1940s until the early 1990s. It gave social, political and economic dominance to the country's white minority over its black population. During the 1970s, black schoolchildren took to the streets to protest against new laws which were introduced to give them an inferior education. The authorities cracked down ruthlessly, killing and wounding many. Mr Bloom, then in his early 20s, started photographing people to capture the tension and excitement of the era. Other pictures, such as portraits of down-and-outs, show the utter despair of people under apartheid. Mr Bloom travelled to London in 1977 where a United Nations organisation called the International Defence and Aid Fund exhibited and published some of the pictures. This led to his exile and political asylum in the UK because it was an offence in South Africa then to dissent against apartheid. Many of the pictures lay in boxes in an attic for decades until 2009 However, many of the pictures lay in boxes in an attic for decades until 2009 when he began printing a selection of the best negatives. In 2012 London's Guardian Gallery exhibited a series of the pictures. This exhibition has since been expanded to include a wider selection of pictures and other artefacts from the anti-apartheid movement. Mr Bloom said: ""Photography is a powerful medium by which viewers comprehend the lives of others and connect to historical global events. ""I am really pleased this exhibition is being shown in Leicester.""  Leicester deputy city mayor for culture, leisure and sport Piara Singh Clair added: ""The images in this exhibition tell a powerful and compelling story of an important time in history.""

Holocaust Memorial Day: Portraits of more than 60 survivors on show,"Photos of more than 60 ""camp survivors and refugees"" have gone on display to mark Holocaust Memorial Day. Generations: Portraits Of Holocaust Survivors includes images taken by Catherine, Princess of Wales and Royal Photographic Society president Simon Hill. It opens at the Imperial War Museum North in Greater Manchester later. Mr Hill said it had been ""an immense privilege"" to work with the survivors and their families. The Holocaust was the attempt by the Nazis and their collaborators to murder all the Jews in Europe and saw more than six million men, women and children murdered between 1941 and 1945. Holocaust Memorial Day takes place on 27 January to mark the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp, the largest of the Nazi extermination camps, in 1945. The exhibition, which was previously shown in London in 2021 and Paris in 2022, aims to capture the connections between Holocaust survivors and the younger generations of their families, shining a light on the full lives they have lived and society's collective responsibility to ensure their stories live on. It was the brainchild of Justin Cohen, the editor of the Jewish News newspaper. The show in Trafford includes four new photographs, all taken by Mr Hill, of Holocaust survivors who made new lives after World War Two and brought up families in the North West of England. The photographer said it had been ""an immense privilege to meet each of these camp survivors and refugees and to explore with them their unique stories"". The exhibition features a photograph of Werner Lachs, 96, and his wife Ruth, 86, who live in Prestwich, Bury. Mr Lachs was born in Cologne, Germany, while Mrs Lachs hails from Hamburg. They both said their lives were normal until 9 November 1938, when an event known as Kristallnacht or the Night of Broken Glass, A Nazi pogrom that saw Jews attacked and killed and their property destroyed, changed things completely. ""I was 12 years old [and] I had no idea what was going on because Cologne was a fairly easy place to live, it wasn't the worst as far as anti-Semitism was concerned,"" Mr Lachs said. ""I led a normal life, all this came completely out of the blue."" He said his father lost his job and the family home in the subsequent persecution, but then ""the miracle came in"". ""One Sunday morning... a letter from Berlin, the British Passport Office, please send your passports for a visa to go to England.  ""How come? We don't know. Back come four visas [and] in June 1939, we left for England."" However, he said 50 years later, he discovered a man named Frank Foley, a spy who worked undercover in the British Embassy passport office in Berlin, had issued passports to Jews with ""no questions asked"". Mrs Lachs said her family fled to the Netherlands after Kristallnacht. ""My parents prepared us very well and said, 'Listen, there's a war on, but it won't last so long',"" she said. ""We were hidden with a couple who were childless and treated us like their own. ""One morning, a knock at the door and the police stood in front, somebody must have given us away or suspected."" She said she was six at the time and was taken to a collection point before transport to a transit camp, but a nurse who had worked for her family hid her in a sandpit when the Nazis came. She remained in hiding until after the war when she was reunited with her parents and settled in England. The couple married in 1962 and have nine grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.

St Paul's Learning Centre hosting free darkroom workshops,"Free photography workshops and hot food are being offered as part of a response to the cost-of-living crisis. The Real Photography Company is holding 12 free workshops at its community darkrooms at the St Paul's Learning Centre in Bristol. Those taking part will include refugees, local residents and people recovering from addiction. ""It's a way for people to enjoy themselves and interact,"" said Justin Quinnell, one of the organisers. Mr Quinnell, one of the directors of The Real Photography Company, said the idea was partly to give people a warm place to go and a chance to save on their household bills. ""People can come here and do a few hours of darkroom photography, people who might be finding it difficult to keep up with energy costs,"" he said. ""After doing a few hours of traditional photography, we also give them some hot food at the end of it. ""A lot of it is combining old and new technology. We've got a large group of people today and we're doing 12 workshops altogether, some during half term and some for different groups. ""The thing about community photography is community.  ""It's important, it's the social side of photography, with people coming in, interacting with each other and inspiring each other."" Chris Bonas, who took part in one of the classes this week, said: ""I've never done anything like this before so it's a good experience for me and something to move forward with, to see what you can do in the future."" He said he hoped to set up an art class with Developing Health and Independence, which helps people to recover from addiction. ""It's an idea that people can engage with that's cheap,"" he added. ""I've been through recovery myself and I know it's a case of trying to run things to get people out of the same situation I was in."" He said group activities were important as they helped people ""get out of isolation"". ""You're not on your own, you can mix and do things. ""You find sometimes when you're stuck in the same place, you isolate yourself and feel you're not good enough, but this [photography] shows you can do it, anyone can do it.""

Sir Paul McCartney: 'Unearthing Beatles photos made me emotional',"Rediscovering a set of photos Sir Paul McCartney took in the early days of The Beatles left him ""instantly flooded with memories and emotions"". Sir Paul took the images during ""an intense three-month period of travel"" in 1963 and 1964 but believed they had been lost. He said unearthing them had ""plunged"" him ""right back"" into the experience. The photos will be shown at the National Portrait Gallery as part of its relaunch and published in a book. Paul McCartney Photographs 1963-64: Eyes of the Storm will run between 28 June and 1 October as one of two major exhibitions that will launch the London gallery's summer programme. The images document December 1963 to February 1964, a period which was an important one for the Liverpool band, taking in their meteoric rise to global superstardom, their record-breaking appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show and the four-piece's youngest member George Harrison's 21st birthday. Sir Paul said he rediscovered about 1,000 images in his archive, which were taken on a 35mm camera and document the ""pandemonium"" the band witnessed as they travelled through Liverpool, London, Paris, New York, Washington, D.C. and Miami. ""Anyone who rediscovers a personal relic or family treasure is instantly flooded with memories and emotions, which then trigger associations buried in the haze of time,"" he said. ""This was exactly my experience in seeing these photos, all taken over an intense three-month period of travel. ""It was a wonderful sensation to be plunged right back."" He added that the photos were ""my own record of our first huge trip"". ""[They are] a photographic journal of The Beatles in six cities, beginning in Liverpool and London, followed by Paris - where John and I had been ordinary hitchhikers three years before - and then what we regarded as the big time, our first visit as a group to America,"" he said. A selection of the photos will be shown in the gallery, while 275 will be included in a book, titled 1964: Eyes of the Storm. Gallery director Dr Nicholas Cullinan said they were ""really extraordinary"". He said Sir Paul's exhibition was ""very interesting"". ""[He] approached us... back in 2020 and said he had found these photographs which he remembered taking but thought had been lost,"" he said. ""We sat down with him and began going through the photographs and they are really extraordinary."" He said to be able to look at the previously unseen images of ""such a well-documented, such a famous and important cultural moment"" was amazing, particularly because they were ""taken by someone who was really, as the exhibition title alludes, in the eye of the storm, looking outside at what was happening"". The gallery, which has been closed since 2020 to refurbish the building, redisplay the collection, create new gallery spaces and improve access with a new entrance, will also host Yevonde: Life and Colour from 22 June to 15 October, an exhibition which will explore the life and career of the 20th Century colour-photography pioneer Yevonde.

Will some teachers receive a 15.9% pay rise?,"Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has claimed that ""almost every newly experienced teacher and 40% of experienced teachers will actually get pay rises up to 15.9%"". But is she right? Ms Keegan was asked on BBC Breakfast about teacher pay increases in England. In July 2022, the government announced that it had accepted the School Teachers' Review Body's (STRB) recommendations on teacher pay.  The pay increases - which came into effect in September 2022 - varied with less experienced teachers getting larger percentage increases.  Teachers in England were offered an average pay rise of 6%. Ms Keegan referred to ""newly experienced teachers"", but that's not an official category applied to staff.  The pay band for qualified teachers in England with the least experience is M1. They will see their pay go up 15.9% as they move up to the next band M2 in 2022-23 (outside London) which you would expect to happen to almost all of them after the first year.  This figure combines the STRB's pay rise and also pay progression components.  So she's right about this specific group of teachers who made up around 5% of teachers in England in 2022-23.  Teachers at this pay band working in London will see their pay go up by a bit less - about 14%. But the education secretary went on to talk about experienced teachers.  She said 40% of them would be getting ""up to 15.9%"", but in fact none of them will be getting that much - they will be getting 9% or 10% if they move up a pay band this year.  We asked the Department for Education (DfE) about the evidence for her claim and were told that the less experienced teachers who could get 15.9% and the 40% of experienced teachers who could get 9% or 10% are indeed separate groups.  Mary Bousted - joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU) - spoke on Radio 4 on 9 January about how much teachers' salaries had fallen after adjusting for rising prices, saying: ""Teachers have lost 24% of their pay in real terms since 2010."" The union later told our colleagues at More or Less that she had mis-spoken and actually meant to say 23%. But that figure is still considerably higher than the figure calculated by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).  It found that between 2010 and 2022, taking into account rising prices, the salaries for the most experienced and senior teachers had fallen 13%, for middle earners it was between 9% and 10% and that starting salaries have fallen 5%. The overall average was 11%. More or Less found that there were two key differences between the calculations by the NEU and the IFS. The first is that the NEU concentrated on experienced teachers because that is the largest group, while the IFS looked at all teachers. But also, the IFS figure was based on CPIH, which is the Office for National Statistics' (ONS) headline figure for inflation. The NEU used RPI, which is generally higher. While the ONS calculates RPI, it  said in 2018: ""we do not think it is a good measure of inflation and discourage its use"". Nonetheless, it's clear that teachers' pay has fallen considerably since 2010 after adjusting for rising prices. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/64308563
India budget 2023: What happened to last year's pledges?,"The Indian government will present its last full budget on Wednesday before the country holds elections in 2024. We've looked at official data to see what progress the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has made since last year's budget pledges. In her 2022 budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that India's economic growth in the current fiscal year (to the end of March 2023) was ""estimated to be 9.2%, [the] highest among all large economies"". But with fears of a global recession and energy prices rising after the war in Ukraine, that growth projection was revised down to 6.8% last December by India's central bank. Even so, the World Bank has said that India is expected to be the ""fastest growing economy"" of the seven largest emerging and developing economies globally.  International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Kristalina Georgieva said this month that India was performing ""better than the global average"".  According to government statistics, India's GDP growth was 13.5% in the first quarter of the financial year (starting in 2022), but fell to 6.3% in the second quarter as the manufacturing sector slowed due to higher raw material costs and energy prices. Dr Aurodeep Nandi, of the Nomura financial services group, says it has been up and down this past year for fiscal math.  ""There were slips along with gains in the fiscal deficit, while government expenditure is looking to slip, it should be counter-balanced by stellar tax revenues and higher GDP growth"" he says. India's fiscal deficit target - the difference between total spending and revenue which the government promised would be kept at 6.4% of GDP - has been maintained at that level so far, according to RBI figures.  The target this year was set lower than in 2020 (9.1%) and 2021 (6.7%) as Covid-related demands on government finances have eased .   However, the government's target to keep its expenditure to 39.45 trillion rupees ($4,800bn; £3,800bn) for the fiscal year will be not be met due to higher import costs, and subsidies on food, fuel and fertiliser.  ""India is expected to exceed its budgeted expenditure by 1.1% of GDP by the end of this fiscal year,"" says to Dr Nandi using estimates by Nomura.  The housing-for-all scheme, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), was launched in 2015 and is one of the flagship welfare projects of the Narendra Modi government.  In the last budget, 480bn rupees ($59bn; £47bn) was allocated for building eight million homes for eligible beneficiaries in rural and urban areas in 2022-23. The schemes for rural and urban areas are implemented by different ministries.  The ministry of housing and urban affairs  - which oversees the urban part of the scheme - said it was behind target and sought an extension of the deadline and further financial assistance from the federal government in August last year.  The deadline has been pushed back to December 2024. In the current fiscal year from 1 April 2022, there's data up to 23 January 2023. This shows 1.2 million houses were completed in urban areas, while under the rural part of the scheme, 2.6 million houses were built. That means the government is currently 4.2 million homes short of its target overall. The finance minister also allocated 600bn rupees ($74bn; £60bn) with an ""aim to cover 38 million households in 2022-23"" with piped water connections.  According to data from the ministry of water resources, so far only around 17 million households have been given piped water connections this year.  That's slightly short of 50% of the target. Since its launch in August 2019, the scheme has provided a total of 77 million households with piped water.  The finance minister also announced last year that the national highways network would be ""expanded by 25,000km (15,534 miles) in 2022-23"".  The 25,000km would include new construction as well as the development of existing roads and the declaration of state highways as national highways. Of this, the ministry of road transport and highways set itself a target to build 12,000km (7,456 miles) in this fiscal year.  But the latest data from the ministry shows that only a total of 5,774km (3,588 miles) of national highways were constructed between April and December 2022 - so less than half the target. We don't yet have data for January this year.  Going by data from previous years, the pace of daily construction has slowed this year to around an average of 21km (13 miles) a day from 29km a day in 2021-22 and 37km a day on average in 2020-21.

Russia sanctions: What impact have they had on its oil and gas exports?,"Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, many countries have pledged to end or restrict their oil and gas imports to curtail Moscow's revenues and hinder its war effort. The Russian economy is highly dependent on its energy sector, and Europe is a major importer of Russian energy, making cutting back difficult. EU nations have ended imports of Russian oil brought in by sea, and a ban on refined oil products will come in from 5 February.  The United States said last March it would stop importing Russian oil, and the UK said it was banning Russian crude oil and refined products with effect from 5 December.  An oil price cap approved by Western allies in December also aims to prevent Russia getting more than $60 (£48) for a barrel of crude oil. Russia's gas sector has also been targeted. The EU said in March it would cut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year. The UK, which only imported small quantities of Russian gas, it has now ended this altogether. Urals oil is currently being exported from Russia's north western sea port of Primorsk for around $40 per barrel, from where it has largely gone to European destinations. The value of Russian oil from other ports and pipelines varies, but the Urals price has fallen across the board since the EU banned imports of Russian oil by sea. The price cap on Russian oil was agreed by the world's major economies at the same time. But energy analyst Ben McWilliams believes it is the EU oil embargo impacting the price, rather than the price cap.  ""Russian oil is being traded at around $50 (£40) per barrel. That has been driven by the embargo because Russia now has to try to sell elsewhere."" Moscow is losing out on about $175m (£140m) a day from fossil fuel exports due to these measures, according to a study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). Major Russian banks have also been removed from the international financial messaging system Swift. Countries continuing to trade with Russia have sought ways around this. Both China and India are increasingly making their oil and gas purchases in their local currencies. India, China and Turkey all ramped up their purchases of Russian oil last year - and together they now make up 70% of all Russian crude flows by sea. And Russia was offering its oil at a significantly lower price than the global benchmark Brent crude.  At the start of 2022, Russia supplied less than 2% of India's oil imports, but it is now on course to become its largest single supplier. China's imports of Russian oil have fluctuated, but have also risen over the past year. In 2021, more than half of all Russia's crude oil exports went to countries in Europe. But in 2022, UK imports of oil from Russia fell sharply and other European countries have cut back too.  But some have remained heavily reliant, such as the Slovak Republic and Hungary. European countries have been looking to see if they can source supplies elsewhere. The International Energy Agency (IEA) club of oil importing countries agreed to release 120m barrels of crude from their stocks in 2022. The US also released some of its strategic reserves last year. But calls for oil-rich nations such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Venezuela to increase production have not been successful. Opec and other major oil producers cut production in late 2022 to sustain prices. Reducing gas imports from Russia has been a major challenge for many European countries, as the continent has been getting most of its gas through pipelines linked to Russia. In 2021, Russia was supplying EU countries with 40% of their natural gas, with Germany the largest importer, followed by Italy and the Netherlands. That had dropped to around 17% by August 2022, according to EU figures. In 2021, the UK got just 4% of its gas supply from Russian. It now imports none. EU states are increasingly looking to ship in liquefied natural gas (LNG) in tankers from producers such as the US and Qatar. The shift towards LNG imports by European countries has been very significant, replacing supplies from Russia. However, ""there aren't enough LNG terminals in Europe"", says energy advisor Kate Dourian. ""This will be a problem for Germany, particularly.""  There are several new LNG terminals planned and some already under construction across Europe as countries try to boost their capacity. Clarification 21 October: A previous version of this story contained a graphic with the title: 'The UK has much less gas storage than some other European countries'. The aim was to show how much gas the UK had in storage at that time. It was not intended to show the UK's total capacity for gas storage. How can the world cope without Russian oil and gas?

"Can these rocks really power light bulbs? No, say the experts","Videos said to show that rocks found in Africa can produce electricity have been viewed millions of times online. Some social media users are claiming they could be the answer to the continent's energy problems. That's a big claim, so we've shown the footage to experts who've explained to us why such properties are highly unlikely. One of the most widely shared videos appears to show electric sparks flying between two rocks as they come into contact. It was shared by, among others, South African businessman Daniel Marven, who has over 800,000 followers. His tweet has now been viewed over two million times. Another Twitter user commented on Mr Marven's post with a different video of a man apparently illuminating an LED light bulb by touching wires connecting it to a small piece of rock.   Marven also posted this video a few hours later, garnering more than a million views.  The reference to ""Wakanda"" in this post relates to a highly-successful fictional African kingdom which is rich in vibranium, a metal with magical properties.  The Marvel comic superhero Black Panther wears a suit made of vibranium, which has the ability to store and release large amounts of energy. Both videos were picked up and used in a thread by popular Twitter page, African Archives. This went viral, with over 35 million views. In the footage of a man shown lighting up an electric bulb apparently using a rock, a voice can be heard speaking Swahili with an accent from the DR Congo. With the video of the two flashing rocks, a reverse image search reveals that this previously appeared on the  Facebook page of the Mohamed First University, in Oujda, Morocco in November last year - although the original video itself may have been uploaded earlier. The caption just says: ""Lithium!!?"" but with no further details.  The BBC has contacted the university but has yet to receive a reply.  One subsequent Twitter post claims these sparking rocks were found in Zimbabwe, saying this discovery ""would help our country have...sustainable energy."" Zimbabwe is Africa's largest producer of lithium, a metallic element widely used in the production of batteries for electric cars and mobile devices. ""I am very sceptical that these videos represent free electrical energy,"" says Prof Stuart Haszeldine of the School of GeoSciences at Edinburgh University. ""I have never seen anything geologically like this and suggest the rocks are connected to electrical power sources not included in the tightly framed video images."" He says the presence of what looks like a gloved hand in the lower part of the video showing the sparking rocks is very revealing. This indicates, he suggests, that ""current is flowing from the out-of-shot battery, through the rock being held with the glove (so the current doesn't flow through the gloved hand) and to earth via the second rock"".  Metallic ores are good conductors of electricity, and the glove is an insulator that prevents the current travelling through the person's body to the ground. Turning to a video showing an illuminated LED bulb, Prof Haszeldine says that it is suspicious ""because there are three hands (two people) in the demonstration"".   ""It looks to me that the current flows when two hands touch, and the wires are mostly illusion. So it may be just as interesting to get a close-up magician to look, and see if a trick of misdirection can be spotted."" In one of the videos the bulb remains lit even though one of the wires has become separated from the rock, a further indication that the rock has nothing to do with the circuit. The DR Congo produces a wealth of valuable mineral ores, including coltan (columbite-tantalite). When refined, coltan yields metallic tantalum, a heat-resistant powder that can hold a high electrical charge, according to Dr Munira Raji of Plymouth University in the UK.  These properties make it invaluable in the manufacture of components used in cell phones, laptops and other electronics.  Dr Raji says it's not possible to confirm whether any of the rocks shown in the videos are coltan without testing them in the geology lab, but even if they were, they cannot generate electricity on their own. In that sense, she says, the claims that these rocks can produce electricity are wrong. Dr Ikenna Okonkwo, a geology lecturer at the University of Nigeria, has also taken a look at the videos for us. He says the rocks look more like zinc or lead ore. And these ores, he says, certainly don't have the ability to power a bulb.  ""Perhaps [they could hold] static electricity of the kind that happens with some fabrics, but it won't keep an LED light bulb powered."" The videos, says Dr Okonkwo, do appear to be ""some kind of trick"". Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/64390767
Ukraine weapons: What tanks and other equipment are the world giving?,"Germany and the US have confirmed that they are sending tanks to Ukraine in a show of support for the government in Kyiv.  The German government said it will be sending 14 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, while the US is planning to deliver 31 Abrams in the coming months.  Germany has also given the go-ahead to a number of other European countries which want to send their own German-made Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine.  The UK, which has already committed 14 of its own tanks, has welcomed the announcements. More than 30 countries have provided military equipment to Ukraine since Russia's invasion in February 2022. Ukraine's President Volodomyr Zelensky has said his forces need Western battle tanks urgently to defend its territory and to push Russian troops out of occupied areas. Some Western officials believe that Russian forces are currently in a weak position and that these more advanced tanks could help Ukraine to push Russian troops back. The Leopard 2, used by a number of European countries, is easier to maintain and requires less fuel than some western alternatives. In the months which followed the Russian invasion, Western nations were keen to offer Ukraine Warsaw Pact rather than Nato standard weaponry, because Ukraine's armed forces had a ready supply of trained crew, spare parts and maintenance capabilities. Switching to Nato standard tanks would have required a range of logistical support which Ukraine did not have in place. Kyiv believes its forces are now in a position to use more Nato standard equipment. The UK has agreed to provide 14 Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine. The Challenger 2 is the British army's main battle tank.  The Challenger 2 was built in the 1990s, but is significantly more advanced than other tanks available to Ukraine's armed forces. Ukraine used Warsaw Pact designed T-72 tanks prior to the invasion, and since February 2022 has received more than 200 T-72s from Poland, the Czech Republic and a small number of other countries. Announcing the US decision to send 31 Abrams tanks to Ukraine, President Joe Biden described them as ""the most capable tanks in the world"". He said the US would start training Ukrainian soldiers to use them immediately but it remains unclear how long it will be until the tanks themselves are delivered.  The BBC's Gary O'Donoghue in Washington says the funding process for the tanks means they may not be deployed for several months.  Military professionals point out that success on the battlefield requires a vast range of equipment, deployed in coordination, with the necessary logistical support in place. The Stryker is one of the many armoured vehicles that have been donated to Ukraine. The US recently confirmed that 90 Strykers would soon be dispatched.   Among the other vehicles donated by the US recently were 59 more Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. They were used extensively by US forces in Iraq. In December, the US also announced it was sending the Patriot missile system to Ukraine - and Germany and the Netherlands have recently followed suit.  This highly sophisticated system has a range of up to 62 miles (100km), depending on the type of missile used, and requires specialised training for Ukrainian soldiers, likely to be carried out at a US Army base in Germany.  But the system is expensive to operate - one Patriot missile costs around $3m. Since the start of the conflict, Ukraine has been using Soviet-era S-300 surface-to-air systems against Russian attacks. Before the conflict began in February, Ukraine had about 250 S-300s and there have been efforts to replenish these with similar systems stockpiled in other former Soviet countries, with some coming from Slovakia. The US has also provided Nasams (National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System) to Ukraine. The first Nasams arrived in Ukraine in November. In addition, the UK has provided several air defence systems, including Starstreak, designed to bring down low-flying aircraft at short range. Germany has also provided air defence systems, including the IRIS-T air defence systems which can hit approaching missiles at an altitude of up to 20km. Among the long-range rocket launchers sent to Ukraine by the US are the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System or Himars. Several European countries have also sent similar systems.  Himars are believed to have been central to Ukraine's success in pushing Russian forces back in the south, particularly in Kherson in November. Crucially, the range of Himars, and many other systems, varies according to the munitions used, and it is believed that western donors have not provided the ammunition with the longest range. The munitions thought to have been supplied to Ukraine give the system a range of about 50 miles (80km), which is further than the Smerch system on the Russian side. Himars systems are also much more accurate than the equivalent Russian systems.  In the months following the invasion and Russia's retreat from Kyiv, much of the war centred on the east of the country where supplies of artillery to Ukraine were in  heavy demand. Australia, Canada and the US were among the countries to send advanced M777 howitzers and ammunition to Ukraine. The range of the M777 is similar to Russia's Giatsint-B howitzer, and much longer than Russia's  D-30 towed gun. Thousands of Nlaw weapons, designed to destroy tanks with a single shot, have also been supplied to Ukraine. The weapons are thought to have been particularly important in stopping the advance of Russian forces on Kyiv in the hours and days following the invasion. Drones have featured heavily in the conflict so far, with many used for surveillance, targeting and heavy lift operations. Turkey has sold Bayraktar TB2 armed drones to Ukraine in recent months, whilst the Turkish manufacturer of the system has donated drones to crowd-funding operations in support of Ukraine. Analysts say the Bayraktar TB2s have been extremely effective, flying at about 25,000 feet (7,600m) before descending to attack Russian targets with laser-guided bombs.

What is levelling up and who is it helping?,"Dozens of schemes across the UK have been awarded funding as part of the the government's ""levelling up"" project. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says its aim is ""to create jobs, drive growth, and make sure that people feel enormous pride in the places that they call home"". But critics say it doesn't make up for the big cuts in local council funding under the Conservatives.  The Levelling Up Fund awarded £1.7bn to projects in October 2021 and another £2.1bn in January 2023. The North West of England got the most money in both rounds of funding. In the latest round, the South East came second, prompting questions about why it was benefitting.  The government has highlighted funding per head of the population. If you look at the funding awards this way, the North of England clearly does better than the South of England. On this measure, Wales comes out on top followed by the North West and North East of England. London and the South of England come at the bottom of the league, with Yorkshire and the Humber also faring badly in the second round. Areas were invited to bid for investment in transport, cultural and town centre and regeneration projects. Local MPs were allowed to give their formal support to two bids before the proposals were judged by officials from the Treasury, Levelling Up Department and Department for Transport. Assessing how fair this is, is not straightforward. Some projects - such as transport for example - may spread across several constituencies, represented by MPs from different parties. For the projects that can be allocated to a single party, we can say that more money was allocated to Conservative constituencies than to Labour ones. But of course, there are significantly more Conservative ones. BBC analysis of the latest round of funding found: Areas have also been competing for money under the government's Towns Fund. In that contest, of the 56 constituencies that won, 47 had Conservative MPs. Labour said the money awarded was dwarfed by the cuts to local authority funding since 2010, with Alex Norris telling MPs: ""the government have nicked a tenner from our wallets and expect us to be grateful for getting less than two quid back."" The Institute for Fiscal Studies found that between 2009-10 and 2019-20, English councils' non-education funding per resident had fallen by almost a quarter, after adjusting for rising prices. The Institute for Government found that councils in the most deprived areas had been worst hit because they were the most reliant on central government funding. Andy Street, the Conservative mayor of the West Midlands criticised the Levelling Up funding process as being part of Whitehall's ""broken begging bowl culture"". He suggested the money would have been allocated better by local decision-makers than civil servants in London. When he was chancellor, Rishi Sunak made changes to the way government funding for projects is allocated to resolve an anti-northern spending bias. It was because the traditional model of comparing the benefits of a project to its cost made it easier to allocate funding to places with high population density and high property prices, such as South East England.  Research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found that: ""On a wide variety of measures, regional disparities in the UK are greater than in most comparable countries."" Many organisations have put forward suggestions of things that need to be addressed such as employment rates, pay, health and formal education, but there seems to be fairly broad agreement that one of the central issues is the differences in productivity between regions - that's the amount of value created (GVA) per hour worked. One of the factors cited as having caused this productivity gap is that government and universities spend more on research and development in the south-east of England.  The government proposes to increase public investment in research and development outside the South East of England by 40%, by 2030. In its 2019 manifesto, the Conservative Party said it would be ""levelling up every part of the UK"". In its White Paper in February 2022, the government laid out its 12 ""levelling up missions"" although there was limited funding to achieve them.

Ukraine helicopter crash: What we know so far,"A helicopter crash in the suburbs of Kyiv has killed 14 people, including one child and Ukraine's interior affairs minister - the country's highest-profile casualty since the war began. Ukraine has launched an investigation into the cause of the crash, but it could take weeks. The BBC has been piecing together what we know and what we don't know in the immediate aftermath of the disaster.  BBC Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse has been reporting from the crash site at Brovary, a suburb on the eastern edge of Kyiv. At the site, near to a kindergarten, he saw wreckage of the aircraft - a door panel and one of the rotors - along with three bodies covered in foil blankets. A video of the aftermath of the crash, verified by the BBC, shows flames and smoke across a wide area between high-rise flats and another residential block. Photos also show the nearby kindergarten blackened by smoke. Ukrainian officials said the glazing of a 14-storey residential building was damaged along with three cars, while the National Emergency Service building was also damaged by the fire. An eyewitness said she heard ""such a noise"" before seeing ""a terrible flame"" and a helicopter ""circling above our home"". She said the burning helicopter headed towards one of the smaller buildings in the area. An analysis of images of the crash site by the BBC has not revealed any evidence of missile debris, and Ukrainian officials have made no mention of any missile fire.  The news agency Reuters quoted a Ukraine Air Force spokesman telling a TV broadcast that it was too early to talk about the causes. But the spokesman added: ""Unfortunately, the sky does not forgive mistakes"". The helicopter crashed at about 08:20 local time (06:20 GMT), just half an hour after sunrise, according to officials. Several videos show cloudy and misty conditions. It is thought it was travelling east towards the front line. Volodymyr Tymoshko, the head of police in the eastern city of Kharkiv, said in a Facebook post that he was due to meet the officials on board today. However, we don't know the route the flight took before it came down as data from its location tracking device would have been blocked to avoid detection.  We have been trying to geolocate other videos purportedly of the helicopter before the crash to establish its route, but have not yet been able to verify them. We don't know how high the helicopter was flying before it got into trouble, but the BBC's James Waterhouse says helicopters travelling towards the front line often fly at very low altitudes to avoid detection by the enemy. ""We've taken similar trips with ministers, it involved hugging treelines and occasionally vaulting over electricity pylons,"" he says. Some analysts have noted there are overhead cables between buildings surrounding the crash site, which may have posed a danger to very low-flying aircraft. However, reporting from the scene, our correspondent says he has not seen any damaged cables in the area. Ukrainian officials say the helicopter was a Eurocopter EC225 Super Puma used by the State Emergency Service. Red and white debris matching images of these helicopters can be seen in photos of the crash site. This is not a military helicopter used in combat, and it's often used to transport members of the Ukrainian government.

China Covid: How many cases and deaths are there?,"China has experienced a surge in Covid infections and deaths across the country since a strict zero-Covid policy was lifted in December, but official data on the extent of the pandemic has been very limited. Between 8 December and 12 January, China says there were 59,938 Covid-related deaths across the country. This figure, published on 15 January, was the first update to its death toll since lockdown restrictions were lifted last year. It's a big jump from the 13 deaths recorded in the previous month - in part because deaths from underlying conditions as well as respiratory failure caused by Covid have now been included. China has also only been recording Covid infections at hospitals and fever clinics for those with recognised symptoms. Asymptomatic cases and positive results from home testing kits are not recorded in the data.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has asked for more ""rapid, regular and reliable"" data on numbers of hospitalisation and deaths. Beijing says it has been sharing Covid data in ""a timely, open and transparent manner in accordance with the law."" Dr Louise Blair, of the UK-based research company Airfinity, says that although the new death toll is higher than earlier, it may still not represent the true number of deaths when you compare China's figures with those from other countries. ""We would expect China to have higher mortality per capita than those countries as they had higher protection from vaccines and in many cases natural immunity than China."" ""These numbers imply a much lower number of deaths per capita in China than all other major countries have experienced,"" she adds. A study by Peking University estimated that as of 11 January, some 64% of the population were reported to be infected with the virus. Reports in late December suggested hospitals were under growing strain from the number of cases, with long queues for clinics and patients on hospital beds in the middle of busy waiting rooms. Videos emerged on social media throughout December appearing to show crowded hospitals as well as queues at funeral homes. The BBC's team in Beijing has also reported on long queues outside health clinics and a high demand for fever remedies at pharmacies. Temporary health centres have been set up along with intensive care facilities across the country. There was a sudden lifting of many of China's Covid restrictions following protests against strict lockdowns across the country in November. Before that, China had one of the toughest anti-Covid regimes in the world - known as its zero-Covid policy.  The measures included strict lockdowns even if only a handful of Covid cases had been found, mass testing in places where cases were reported, and people with Covid having to isolate at home or under quarantine at government facilities. Lockdowns have now been scrapped, and quarantine rules have been abolished. A negative Covid test is no longer required to enter public transport, restaurants, gyms and other public buildings (with the exception of orphanages and care homes). On 8 January, China fully opened its borders with no travel restrictions or quarantine measures for arrivals. However, several countries including the US and the UK, have imposed Covid testing on visitors from China due to its Covid surge in a move strongly criticised by China. Overall, China says more than 90% of the population has been fully vaccinated.  However, around the time its zero-Covid policy was lifted,  less than half of people aged 80 and over had received three doses of vaccine.    The authorities now say they require local health services to ""strengthen immunization of the whole population, particularly the elderly"". There are doubts over whether the main vaccines used in China - Sinovac and Sinopharm - are effective against Omicron, the most widespread strain. China has refused to use Western vaccines widely. The government has given no official explanation. However, national pride may be a factor according to Dr Yu Jie, Senior Research Fellow on China at the international affairs think tank Chatham House: ""I think it's Xi Jinping really thinking of things in terms of economic self-reliance - that need to have China produce and use its own vaccine, rather than import it from somewhere.""

Andrew Bagshaw and Chris Parry: Piecing together last known movements of missing Brits in Ukraine,"The body of one of two Britons who went missing in Ukraine has been found, according to a Russian mercenary group. While the claim has yet to be verified by the BBC, the disappearance of Andrew Bagshaw and Chris Parry has raised questions about their last-known movements and what they were doing in Ukraine. Chris Parry, 28, had spoken to multiple journalists saying he was working as a volunteer evacuating civilians from the front lines in eastern Ukraine. A Ukrainian charity - Pavlo Vyshniakov Foundation - told the BBC that Mr Parry had worked with them, but that Mr Bagshaw had not. A Telegram channel associated with Yevgeny Prigozhin, boss of Russian mercenary group Wagner, earlier released an image of a document which had the name of that charity and Mr Parry's permission to operate as a volunteer.  The same Telegram post included images of what appear to be the two men's passports, although we have not been able to verify them definitely. We spoke to a former UK border official who told us that ""from looking at these pictures they appear to be genuine, several safeguards can be seen."" A volunteer who said he worked as Andrew Bagshaw's interpreter supplied us with a video posted on 12 December 2022 showing Mr Bagshaw and Mr Parry wearing civilian clothes carrying a stretcher into a hospital building in the city of Sloviansk in eastern Ukraine. We've been able to verify the location by comparing the video with other confirmed images of the hospital. Mr Parry and Mr Bagshaw, 48, were believed to have headed to the heavily bombarded front-line town of Soledar on Friday 6 January. In an Instagram post, a friend of theirs - also working as a volunteer - said that the pair had made the journey to carry out evacuations.  ""If you have any information on the whereabouts of the boys, or have seen their car (Black Land Rover, AFIO HWU), please contact me or the police,"" the friend added. There are lots of groups in the area, which include foreigners, who help with evacuations of civilians and bring food and supplies to people.   BBC correspondent Yogita Limaye and producer Imogen Anderson met Mr Parry, from Truro in Cornwall, on new year's day in the city of Kramatorsk, in the eastern Donbas region. They had been looking to report on Bakhmut, the scene of intense fighting, and the volunteers working there. He told them he had been staying in the city for about six weeks, and had just acquired a new 4x4 through a fundraiser he had started two months before.  He told the BBC journalists that he had to abandon his old car in Bakhmut the previous week. It had been ""shot by a tank"" he posted on Instagram at the time.  He told the pair that he had no intention of leaving Ukraine, where he had been since March.   The journalists were on their way to Bakhmut on 2 January when Mr Parry got in touch to say he was also going into the city. But once they reached Bakhmut they lost reception and that was the last contact they had with the volunteer.  The following day, Mr Parry gave an interview to BBC Radio Cornwall and described a close encounter he'd had with a drone in the Bakhmut area. Mr Parry said that he was staying in a town 10 miles from the front line and explained his motivation was to help children particularly.  ""To be able to get them out of these war-torn areas, it makes it definitely more worthwhile than anything else that I can imagine."" In a previous interview with the same station in November 2022, he said he had become ""obsessed"" with Ukraine after the invasion, realised he could not fight and decided it would be more useful for him to get a van and help evacuate civilians. On 3 January, three days before the volunteers disappeared, Mr Parry was interviewed in Bakhmut by freelance journalist Arnaud de Decker.  Mr Parry told the journalist he had been volunteering as an evacuation driver.  ""I receive requests from family members who ask us to go and collect their relatives."" Describing an evacuation, he said there had been ""lots of Ukrainian missiles...  a lot of small arms firing"".  He said: ""A lot of volunteers won't go anymore, but there are people there who want to get out, so I'm willing to go."" Mr Parry said he used a vehicle for evacuations - his black Land Rover is seen in the video. Mr De Decker spoke to BBC Radio Cornwall on Thursday about the interview on 3 January. He said when he met Mr Parry, he had just returned from an evacuation in the east of Bakhmut. ""It's a very dangerous part. Volunteers, most of them, they don't dare to go there, because it's too dangerous.  ""Chris went that morning to rescue a resident who was stuck... in her apartment. Chris was able to go to the eastern part with his own car, cross the river, and he was able to save her."" Mr De Decker said Mr Parry had ""probably saved hundreds of people from the frontline areas"".  Regarding Andrew Bagshaw, the BBC has spoken to Grzegorz Rybak, who lives in Edinburgh, but travelled to Ukraine in November. He says he carried out evacuations alongside Mr Bagshaw, acting as his interpreter. Mr Rybak said the 48 year old had travelled to Ukraine in March, and first worked distributing aid, before starting evacuations during the summer.  Journalist and filmmaker Laurel Chor told the BBC she first met Mr Bagshaw in October in Kramatorsk. She says she joined him on evacuations in Bakhmut on three occasions in November. ""Andrew had been doing it for months and months and largely on his own. He lived in Kramatorsk, had a vehicle that he'd scrounge up donations for and he was really doing all the evacuations that he could. He was very quiet about it."" She added: ""Andrew was so experienced."" She said she believes there were about 12 volunteers working independently on frontline evacuations in the region. ""There's a small group of mostly independent volunteers, mostly foreign, who have just taken upon themselves to do evacuations.  ""They don't necessarily work with an organisation. What they do is so dangerous. ""They are often going into areas that are actively getting shelled and sometimes they go further in where it's actually the grey zone of the contested territory, in between Ukrainian and Russian positions."" The Foreign Office has not confirmed whether either of the volunteers have died.

Andrew Bridgen: What has suspended MP said about vaccines?,"The Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen has been suspended by his party after comparing the side effects of Covid vaccines to the Holocaust.  In a tweet - which he has since deleted - he claimed that an unnamed cardiologist told him it was ""the biggest crime since the Holocaust"".  The North West Leicestershire MP began the pandemic raising concerns about lockdowns and later opposing the idea of mandatory vaccination, but he praised the UK's vaccine roll-out and tweeted encouraging others to get the jab after his first dose.  However in recent months, he has made increasingly misleading statements about vaccine safety. In December 2022, Mr Bridgen called in Parliament for a ""complete suspension"" of Covid vaccines based on what he described as, ""robust data of significant harms and little ongoing benefit"".  This went against the overwhelming weight of evidence, from a number of different independent teams of researchers, that found that Covid vaccines' benefits far outweigh any known harms.  The latest figures suggest the vaccines are more than 90% effective at preventing deaths, falling to 50% after six months.  Older people still have around 60% protection against hospital admission, nine months after receiving a booster jab. Serious side effects do exist but they are rare.  After more than 45 million people received at least two doses in England and Wales, 59 deaths involving the vaccines had been registered as of November 2022 - though more may be recorded as it takes time for such deaths to be investigated.  There were 15 reports of suspected heart inflammation or scarring (myocarditis or pericarditis) for every one million second doses of the Pfizer vaccine given in the UK up until the end of last November according to the UK Health Security Agency, and roughly 11 cases of an unusual type of blood clot linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine per one million doses.  A Danish study of four million people found no link between vaccination and risk of heart failure among people who developed myocarditis or pericarditis.  These risks vary by age and this has been taken into account by health bodies who have made decisions about the vaccines.  When it became clear the risk from blood clots was too close to the risk from Covid in younger age groups, the recommendations for younger people changed.  Also in December 2022, Mr Bridgen told MPs: ""There have been more reported deaths and adverse reactions following mRNA vaccination [Pfizer and Moderna] in 18 months than there has been to every conventional vaccine administered worldwide for the last 50 years"". At the time, we asked Mr Bridgen for the evidence for this.  He referred us to information drawn from the UK Yellow Card scheme - set up by the medicines and vaccines regulator (MHRA) for people in the UK to report their concerns or symptoms after having the jab. But that data can't be used to back up his claim.  The scheme works by allowing anyone to make a report relating to anything that happens to them after having a vaccine - the figures on their own cannot be used to tell if the vaccine was responsible for this.  The scheme can't be used to accurately measure how vaccine side effects have changed over time.  At different points, there might have been over-reporting - where the symptoms people record aren't actually caused by the vaccine - and under-reporting - where people don't record genuine side effects.  The MHRA said the fact that more people were reporting to the scheme was expected,""given the scale of the Covid-19 vaccination programme, and publicity in the context of the pandemic,"" rather than indicating a real rise in side effects.  It is also UK data and Mr Bridgen did not provide evidence to compare this with all conventional vaccines worldwide for the last 50 years.   A better way of understanding the level of vaccine side effects is to look at clinical trials.  These have helped us learn about genuine but rare side effects like blood clots and myocarditis. They have concluded that these are significantly outweighed by the deaths and illness that the Covid vaccines have prevented. In December, Mr Bridgen claimed in Parliament that the head of a cardiology research department, who he did not name, with a ""leadership role with the British Heart Foundation...sent out non-disclosure agreements to his research team to ensure that this important data [on vaccine harms] never sees the light of day"". When asked by The Times newspaper to provide evidence, Mr Bridgen failed to do so. The British Heart Foundation said in a statement: ""Scientific evidence shows that Covid-19 itself is much more likely to cause myocarditis than the vaccine is, and people who are vaccinated have a much lower risk of getting other serious complications caused by Covid-19. ""We employ a small leadership team of senior scientists and cardiologists to oversee and administer our research funding programmes, who also continue to undertake some of their own research. We can categorically say that nobody within this leadership team has acted in the way claimed by Mr Bridgen."" Since then, Mr Bridgen has also referred to Covid vaccines as ""experimental gene therapy"" - a term used by those who spread anti-vaccine conspiracies online. The vaccines do not affect DNA and therefore the NHS does not define them as gene therapy.  The BBC has approached Mr Bridgen for comment.  Update 13 January - Mr Bridgen has subsequently released a video statement, saying: ""There are very reasonable questions to be asked about the safety and effectiveness of the experimental mRNA vaccines and the risks and benefits of these treatments.""

Ukraine war: Who controls Soledar and why it matters,"Russia has not taken a key town or city in Ukraine for months, despite intense efforts to achieve military gains.  If Russian forces seize the eastern town of Soledar, their hope is that the course of the war could change. When Russian mercenary leader Yevgeniy Prigozhin announced his Wagner units had taken control of the entire territory of Soledar, the images produced looked convincing. But Wagner fighters are not part of the regular Russian armed forces and the defence ministry in Moscow says the battle is still going on.  Ukraine's president also says the fight is continuing and Kyiv is adamant the Russians are not succeeding in their push to capture the town. The fall of Soledar may help Russian troops in their assault on the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, about 10km (6 miles) to the south west, providing them with a secure artillery position within range of the city.   Soledar also has deep salt mines, which could be used to station troops and store equipment, protected from Ukrainian missiles. In video posted on a Russian Telegram channel, which the BBC has not yet been able to verify, Mr Prigozhin is apparently seen alongside Wagner soldiers in a Soledar salt mine.  The mines have an extensive underground network of tunnels, which could be of strategic importance as Russian forces attempt to penetrate Ukrainian-controlled territory.   It is not clear, however, how much of this network is accessible and where it might lead. Soledar's mines also contain valuable salt and gypsum, which could provide an important source of revenue for anyone who controls and is able to extract resources from it. But perhaps one of the most important factors in the battle for Soledar is a symbolic one.  ""The reason they are throwing everything at it,"" says the BBC's James Waterhouse in Ukraine, ""is that there is a big propaganda win here… a vital trophy for President Vladimir Putin to present to critics back in Russia"". Taking control of the nearby city Bakhmut would certainly be a prize for Russian forces in the region.  ""This would be a much needed boost for Russian forces in the east who have been under real pressure since September,"" says Edward Arnold, a European security researcher at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi).  However, he adds that ""the seizure of Bakhmut will have little strategic significance for the outcome of the war"".  The Wagner Group has become increasingly influential in the Ukraine conflict and Mr Prigozhin has been behind its advance on the battlefield. He claims his fighters are the only ones fighting in Soledar, although the Russian defence ministry says its forces are also taking part. The battle for Soledar and Bakhmut is only part of the front line and the broader campaign is not going well for Vladimir Putin. Russia again replaced the head of its regular forces in Ukraine only three months after he was put in place, in another sign of dissatisfaction at the lack of progress. ""[Prigozhin will] continue to use both confirmed and fabricated Wagner Group success in Soledar and Bakhmut,"" says the Institute for the Study of War ""to promote [it] as the only Russian force in Ukraine capable of securing tangible gains."" Wagner has also been prominent in conflict zones in Africa, invited in by governments battling insurgent rebel forces. In doing so, the mercenaries have often taken control of valuable mining resources.  Reporting by Jake Horton and Tom Spencer.

Is the NHS pay review body independent?,"Nurses in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have taken industrial action over pay, in the biggest strike in NHS history. Health Secretary Steve Barclay has defended the pay offer made to nurses in England, emphasising it has based it on recommendations by an ""independent"" pay review body (PRB). But the Trade Union Congress (TUC) says the PRBs can't act with full independence because the government sets the upper limits of what they can recommend. The salaries of NHS staff, as well as other public-sector workers such as police officers, teachers and the members of the armed forces, are recommended by eight pay review bodies.  They cover 2.5 million workers - about 45% of public-sector staff - and a pay bill of around £100 billion. The PRBs are made up of economists and experts on human resources, with experience in both the public and private sector and are appointed by the relevant government department. The NHS PRB has eight members. It has been led by Philippa Hird since 2017. Until 2009, she was group human resources director of media firm ITV and had previously held general management and HR roles in Granada Group. The government website says: ""The appointments are made on merit and political activity played no part in the decision process.""  The government also decides on remuneration for the members of the PRBs. For the NHS PRB, it is currently £350 a day for the chair, for preparation and attendance of meetings, and £300 for the members. The body takes evidence from a number of interested parties.  This includes relevant government departments, as well as unions and expert organisations, before they come to a recommendation on how pay should change each year. The government does say what pay award it wants as part of its evidence submission and it determines when it will respond to and publish the reports of pay review bodies. The recommendation from the PRB is not legally binding.  The government usually accepts the recommendations, but in 2014 Jeremy Hunt, the then health secretary, rejected the NHS PRB's recommendation. In July 2022, the government accepted in full its recommendation to give all NHS workers a pay rise of roughly £1,400 this year, worth about 4%, on average, for nurses. The Royal College of Nurses (RCN) wants the government to ""rethink"" this and is asking for a pay rise of 5% above the RPI rate of inflation - which adds up to 19% currently.  The government says it will wait until the NHS PRB makes its next recommendation in 2023. As for the other PRBs in 2022, the government accepted in full pay recommendations from five of them and rejected parts of recommendations by two others - the Prison Service PRB and the Senior Salaries PRB - according to an Institute for Government report. There are, however, government-set constraints that the pay review bodies have to take into consideration when making their recommendations.  Speaking to Radio 4, Paul Nowak, General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: ""The government sets out very clearly its financial envelope. That really ties the hands of the pay review bodies in terms of what they can recommend."" The NHS pay review body - like other bodies which recommend pay for other public sector workers - has to work with the funds available to the department.  In the remit letter to the chair of the NHS Pay Review Body, Health Secretary Steve Barclay said the body should take into account when forming recommendations: Ben Zaranko, from the Institute of Fiscal Studies, told Newsnight the remits of the pay review bodies should not include managing the economy-wide level of inflation. He said they should be more narrowly focused on ""ensuring that we can attract, retain and motivate public sector workers in the places where we need them"". The NHS PRB recommendations were announced in the summer, but the work that underpinned them took place earlier in the year, raising questions over whether its decision is now out of date because of the rapidly changing situation regarding inflation and other factors.  The chair of the Health Select Committee, Conservative MP Steve Brine, told the World at One on Radio 4 that the PRB made its calculations ""before the war [in Ukraine] started in February"" and recommended ""sending it back to the pay review body to have a look"".

The NHS crisis - decades in the making,"The NHS is in the middle of its worst winter in a generation, with senior doctors warning that hospitals are facing intolerable pressures that are costing lives.  A&E waits and ambulance delays are at their worst levels on record.  The health service was already under pressure - the result of long-standing problems - but Covid, flu and now strike action by staff have all added to the sense of crisis this winter.  So how did the NHS get to this point? Advances in medicine over recent decades have meant people are living longer. That is a success story. But it means the NHS, like every health service in the developed world, is having to cope with an ageing population.  That puts a huge strain on the health service. Half of over-65s have two or more health conditions and are responsible for two-thirds of all hospital admissions. To help the health service cope with this demand as well as pay for the advances in medicine, the NHS budget has traditionally risen by an average of 4% above inflation each year.  But since 2010, the average annual rate of increase has been half that. Of course, that is when a Conservative-led government came into power, although it is worth bearing in mind Labour were also signed up to this squeeze following the 2008 financial crash. Labour - despite previous big increases in funding - were promising less for the health service than the Tories in the 2010 election, while in 2015 there was little between the two parties. The government points to extra funding for the NHS during this parliament and topped up further in the Autumn Statement but a decade of austerity has come at a cost.  Bed numbers have fallen, while staffing shortages have increased. Currently around one in 10 NHS posts are vacant, leaving the UK with fewer doctors and nurses than many of its Western European counterparts.  The lack of staff puts even more pressure on those in post. Talk to paramedics, nurses and doctors and one of the most common refrains is that the job is no longer enjoyable because they cannot provide the level of care they want for their patients. Alongside pay, this is a driving factor for those ambulance staff and nurses who took strike action last month and look set to do so again in the coming weeks. In fact, they argue the two issues are interlinked. Pay for NHS staff has been cut over the past decade once inflation is taken into account. Until that is addressed, the government has little chance of plugging the staff gaps, they believe. The problems being seen also have their origins in when the NHS was created in the aftermath of World War II. The decision was taken to split health (run by the NHS) and social care for the elderly (run by councils). More than 70 years on, and despite some move towards integration, this division still persists. This is despite successive governments since the late 1990s all promising major reform. It means we have a health system that is free at the point of need, but a care system that is means-tested and has been squeezed even more than the NHS. The waiting list for care is rising sharply, while this sector too has a staffing crisis with one in 10 posts also vacant. They are two very different systems, despite being two sides of the same coin. Without care to keep them independent, the frail elderly are more likely to end up in hospital and less likely to be able to get out. Every day more than half of patients who are ready to leave hospital cannot because of a lack of care in the community. Not all of this is down to social care, but much of it is. This divide is something that does not exist - certainly not to such an acute extent - in many of the social insurance systems across the world that have been developed much more around the needs of the individual. Of course, the NHS, like other health systems, has been battered by the pandemic. Waiting lists have grown and staff have been left exhausted from fighting Covid - the latter is another factor that has driven staff to vote for industrial action. What is more, the tail end of the pandemic has had a sting. Other infections, and in particular flu, have rebounded after the lockdowns suppressed cases and immunity. The NHS is now in the grip of its worst flu season for a decade - and this has come as the fifth wave of Covid has reared its head. And while the most recent data suggests hospitalisations for both may have peaked, experts are urging caution because reporting delays over the festive period may have masked what is happening. There has been another consequence too - the indirect health impacts. This is something England's Chief Medical Officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty warned about at the start of the pandemic and now appears to be taking off. The lockdown led to people with chronic conditions not always getting the support they needed - patients with heart problems not getting statins and people with respiratory illness not getting their regular checks for example.  This is thought to be one factor behind the rising demand being seen on the emergency care system, as well as the higher-than-expected number of deaths being seen.  A frailer, sicker population is adding to the pressure when the NHS and its staff are least able to respond. Data analysis by Harriet Agerholm ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-64190440
Brazil Congress: How police failed to stop the protest,"Just one week after the inauguration of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva as president of Brazil, thousands of supporters of the previous incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, stormed the country's Congress, Supreme Court and presidential palace.  The president said security forces in the capital, Brasília didn't do enough to stop them. We've looked into the key moments and how the police responded.   Since the narrow election win in October by the left-wing president, better known as Lula, supporters of his right-wing rival had been setting up camps in front of military barracks in many cities around the country.  His most ardent supporters have been calling for the army to intervene and overturn the election result.   Then over the weekend, thousands of people gathered outside the army barracks in Brasília, many of them brought in by bus.  President Lula called on local security forces to remove these protesters, but police had opted to not use force.   On Sunday afternoon, the protesters set off on a march towards the complex of government buildings. Video footage shows the march peacefully under way, with military police escorting them along the 7km (four mile) route.   We have asked the police authorities in Brasília whether the protesters had been granted official permission to march along this route ahead of time. We haven't yet received a response.  The protesters arrived at barriers blocking access to the complex of government buildings known as ""Praça dos Três Poderes"" (Three Powers Square).   A video verified by the BBC shows only a single line of metal barriers across a road through a relatively open area. One of the policemen can be seen pulling out what appears to be pepper spray or tear gas, aiming it at the protesters, who quickly force their way through.   We have asked the police why they hadn't organised stronger barriers and mobilised more officers to control the situation once the protesters approached the government square.   Once the barriers had been breached, crowds flooded onto ramps which led to the Congress building and the presidential palace.  Police have been criticised for being too hands-off with the protesters as they streamed in.  Two videos we've verified shows policemen taking pictures of the crowds as they walk up the ramps and into the Congress building.  Another video shows a policeman being pulled from his horse by protesters as they approach the Congress building and thrown to the ground.  The National Congress and the presidential palace were breached just before 15:00 local time.  Videos show protesters using security barricades to smash through several large windows before entering, spreading throughout both buildings and onto the roof of Congress.  The BBC has also verified this video which shows police standing by as protesters walk up a staircase into the Congress building through the lower floor entrance. Police holding riot shields are standing on the right of the stairs, but they aren't protecting the main entrance and appear to be guarding a side corridor instead.  One policeman waves the protesters through and gives them a thumbs up. As the crowd move forward into the building, some of them applaud the security personnel. From the police uniforms seen in the video it looks like they are part of the Policia Legislativa, the Federal police group that works inside Congress.  Shortly afterwards, a group also smashed windows of the Supreme Court and entered the building. Images show that once inside the buildings, protesters destroyed furniture, equipment and works of art.  Social media posts from the afternoon of 8 January clearly show scores of protestors both outside in the plaza and milling around inside buildings, in some cases with no police or security forces visible.  Videos circulating online showed protesters trashing offices, smashing windows and doors, flipping furniture, and tossing computers and printers to the ground.  The governor of Brasília, Ibaneis Rocha, eventually requested support from the national government - although it's not clear when exactly this was made.   President Lula announced soon afterwards that he had authorised national forces to intervene in Brasília.   Even with the involvement of additional forces, it took many more hours to bring the situation under control. The Supreme Court was the first to be cleared.  Then, as more forces arrived, other buildings were also gradually emptied.   Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/64212071
Ukraine war: What does facial recognition software make of Putin’s backdrop crowd?,"Social media is awash with claims, repeated on news websites, that Russian President Vladimir Putin surrounded himself with actors for his New Year's address and at previous events. But what's the evidence? We used facial recognition software to check some of these allegations. The Russian president has a track record of posing at events where some of the attendees are not what they seem.   A BBC Russian investigation in 2020 found that some events presented as impromptu conversations with everyday people were actually filled with friendly local officials. Social media posts, and news websites such as the Sun and the Daily Mail, have suggested a blonde woman has been playing different characters at several previous events with Mr Putin, including a fishing trip in 2016 and a church service in 2017. Others, including a Ukrainian news report, say she may be part of Russia's Federal Guards Service (FSO) - a security force that protects top leaders. We've used facial recognition software to compare the face of the woman in the New Year picture with those in 2016 and 2017, producing low match results of 29% and 28% respectively.  ""Usually, a similarity score of 75% or higher should be considered when looking for an identity match,"" says Professor Hassan Ugail, Director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.  Next, we compared the images from the events held in 2016 and 2017, which generated a 99.1% score, strongly indicating that these two are of the same person.   This woman has been identified in Russian media as Larisa Sergukhina. Both events at which she appeared took place in the Novgorod region where she is a member of the regional parliament for the United Russia Party, which backs Mr Putin. When we compared her 2016 image from the boat with her official party portrait online we got a 99.8% match. Ms Sergukhina is also listed as the founder of a company that trades fish in Novgorod.  The woman at the New Year address has been named in Russian media as Anna Sergeevna Sidorenko, a captain and military doctor. Comparing her face at the event with an image taken from a video interview posted online by the Russian Isvestia newspaper gave a 99.5% match. Her name also appears on a members list of a Russian military regiment published by the Ukrainian intelligence services.   We then looked into claims about a group of men in fishing gear, photographed with Mr Putin on a boat in 2016. The same men, it was alleged, were also photographed at the 2017 church service. Comparing the faces on the boat with those in the church through facial recognition software gave us similarity scores of over 99% for all four men, so we looked further into their identities. We found evidence they all worked in the Novgorod region, and at least three of them appear to be fishermen. Aleksey Lyashenko (1) is the leader of the fishing crew pictured with Mr Putin. We know this from his social media accounts as well as profiles published about the crew online. Yevgeny Lyashenko (5) is Aleksey's son. He is also named in the profile as part of the same team. Both Aleksey and Yevgeny have social media accounts which confirm they are father and son. According to the same profile, the crew is part of the local agricultural conglomerate called Evrokhimservis, whose deputy general director is Larisa Sergukhina (3). Sergey Alexandrov (2) is quoted in Russian media as a fisherman. We found his social media profile which shows him on a boat wearing fisherman's clothing. We couldn't find a social media profile for man number 4, but we found an image which matches him on which someone has commented ""How did it happen with Putin?"" with the reply: ""He met several times with Putin at work in Novgorod"". Another image posted online claims two of these fishermen also met Mr Putin posing as farmers in the Stavropol region. But when comparing the faces of the farmers highlighted with the two fishermen, facial recognition shows less than an 8% similarity for both. There have been several other examples where blonde women have been highlighted as potential actors at events in the past, including two pictures of a woman serving ice cream to Mr Putin at an air show in 2017 and 2019. The images here are from the side, and of lower resolution, which makes facial recognition unreliable, so we can't use it to make a judgement. But we found an interview on Russian television in 2019 with a woman recorded claiming to be the ice cream seller who served the president on both occasions.  And if they are the same person this wouldn't be particularly surprising given that they're both taken at the same air show, visited by Mr Putin two years apart. People have claimed that the same woman who sold Putin ice cream had posed as a member of staff at Aeroflot, a Russian airline, but once again, facial recognition is not a reliable tool which to compare the images in this case. There was also an example in May when people claimed an injured soldier who met Mr Putin during a hospital visit had been pictured with him in a factory previously.  However, when you run the faces of the man from both events through facial recognition it shows around a 25% similarity, indicating there isn't a match. Additional reporting by Olga Robinson.

Ethiopia conflict: How is aid flowing to Tigray?,"The UN has voiced concern about high levels of child malnutrition in Ethiopia's Tigray region, despite more aid coming in after last November's peace deal between the government and Tigrayan forces. A third of children assessed late last month were acutely malnourished, and about four per cent of children screened were severely malnourished, says the UN.  Although the flow of humanitarian aid is gradually being scaled-up, it is ""still inadequate to meet vast needs,"" according to the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs.  And some areas remain inaccessible, mostly along the border with Eritrea and those areas of Tigray adjoining the Amhara and Afar regions of Ethiopia. It has also been a challenge reaching people living far away from main roads. The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus who is himself from Tigray, says there has been progress in delivering food aid and medicine to Tigray. ""There is progress in both...[but] still there are a lot of areas that are not yet covered,"" he says.  For many months, the only viable land route into Tigray had been from the Afar region to the east. But even that was highly problematic with very limited supplies getting through. Now convoys are able to travel this route more freely, and also use two others from the south and further to the west. The UN says by late December, 20 organisations had delivered more than 100,000 tonnes of food and more than ten tonnes of non-food items to Tigray, including medical supplies. The Ethiopian government also distributed food aid to some areas in Tigray following what it described as the improved security situation. Humanitarian flights to the regional capital, Mekelle, and the city of Shire, have been carrying medical supplies and aid workers. The UN says 17 tonnes of medical supplies have been flown from the capital, Addis Ababa, to Shire and Mekelle since the signing of the deal. The flow of aid into the Tigray region became problematic after fighting broke out in November 2020.  There were periods when international aid agencies had access - between July and December 2021 and between April and August 2022. But there have been months when there's been very limited or no access for humanitarian aid and staff into the region as the flow was affected by fighting along delivery routes, multiple roadblocks and vehicle checks and damage to key infrastructure. Delays in issuing approval for aid convoys to travel by road through areas held by federal and regional government forces was also an issue.  The government also put in place strict controls for humanitarian aid flights - including a requirement for all flights to land first in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, for inspection. The first movement of aid to Mekelle after the peace deal was a convoy of two trucks carrying medical aid on 15 November. Prior to that, the last movement of a UN humanitarian cargo into Tigray was on 22 August along the Semera route. There was also an airlift of aid on 23 August from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, to Mekelle. More than five million people were facing severe hunger in Tigray at that time, according to the World Food Programme. The UN says more than half of these people have benefited from aid deliveries in recent weeks. In addition to humanitarian aid, large parts of the Tigray region have been without electricity, telephones, internet and banking services for close to two years. The government recently reconnected the regional capital, Mekelle, to the national electricity grid, raising hopes that electricity supplies will soon be restored more widely in Tigray.  Mobile telephone connectivity has also been restored in some areas, including Mekelle and Shire, but some areas remain without power and phone communications. The government says it is working on repairing and restoring infrastructure. Ethiopian Airlines resumed commercial passenger flights to Mekelle on 28 December and later to Shire on 2 January. Banking services have also restarted in some parts of the Tigray region. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/57929853

Edith Thompson: The wife who was executed for her lover's crime,"On 9 January 1923 Edith Thompson and her lover Frederick Bywaters were executed for the murder of her husband, even though there was no evidence she knew he would be stabbed. Why was she convicted, and how does the case still resonate a century later? The hangman and his assistants arrived promptly at the condemned cell of London's Holloway Prison on what was an icy Tuesday morning. Before them 29-year-old Edith Thompson lay slumped, barely conscious following days of injections of a powerful sedative. She let out a moan as the execution team moved in. ""Come on, it'll soon be over,"" one of the men tells her as he raises her by the waist. Edith's arms and ankles are bound and she is carried towards a shed where a gallows and trapdoor await. Within seconds, she is dead. Half a mile away in Pentonville Prison, and at the same time, her 20-year-old lover suffered the same fate. Three months earlier Freddy Bywaters had repeatedly stabbed Edith's husband Percy as the married couple made their way home from a trip to the theatre. Freddy always insisted it was an attack his lover did not know was coming. Edith's crime was to be attractive, independent, working class and unfaithful - the victim, according to one expert on the case, of a societal intolerance of women who did not obey the moral codes of the day. As the prolific novelist and screenwriter Edgar Wallace put it: ""If ever in the history of this country a woman was hanged by the sheer prejudice of the uninformed public, and without the slightest modicum of evidence to justify the hanging, that woman was Edith Thompson."" Edith Graydon was someone who wanted a life that was different from the one working-class women were expected to accept. Born in the east London suburb of Manor Park on Christmas Day in 1893, she was the first of five children. As the eldest, Edith would help her mother look after her sister and three brothers. Once her schooling was complete, the ambitious and intelligent young woman headed into the City for work, joining wholesale milliners Carlton & Prior. She quickly rose within the ranks to become the firm's chief buyer. ""She was a sort of so-called ordinary woman who wanted to be extraordinary,"" says author Laura Thompson, who has written two books about the case. In January 1916 Edith married shipping clerk Percy Thompson. They bought a house at 41 Kensington Gardens in Ilford, not far from where both had grown up. Edith earned more than her new husband - and also her father - and contributed more than half the £250 cost of the property, although the deeds had to be in Percy's name. As a newly married young woman she would have been expected to settle into domestic life and motherhood, but Edith had other ideas. An excellent dancer, she enjoyed nights out at London's finest hotels and dance halls - places not intended for people of her social standing - and evenings were often spent with friends at West End theatres, cinemas and restaurants. ""I find her such a modern figure, she's a sort of Grazia girl,"" says Ms Thompson, who is not related to Edith. ""She's a girl about town. She's ambitious, she's aspirational. She wanted to own her own home which she did even though it had to be in her husband's name."" Unwilling to be bound by the conventions of the time, Edith was not an ordinary wife. What is more, she had a lover, a handsome and charming man more than eight years her junior. Frederick Bywaters knew the Graydon family as he was in the same class at school as one of Edith's brothers. At the age of 13, Freddy left London to join the Merchant Navy. During a visit home in June 1921 he was invited to the Isle of Wight for a weeklong holiday with Percy, Edith and her sister Avis Graydon. By the end of the trip a furtive romance had begun between the teenager and Edith, which only flourished when Freddy was invited to move in with the Thompsons for a few weeks. He would end up leaving 41 Kensington Gardens following a confrontation with Percy, who was sometimes abusive towards his wife. During the argument she was thrown across the room by Percy, leaving her badly bruised. With Freddy often away, the lovers wrote to one other frequently in letters Edith instructed must be destroyed after reading. ""They're remarkable documents,"" says Ms Thompson, whose new book examines the letters in detail. ""They're so expressive, they're sort of her other self poured on the page."" In one letter, Edith jumps from describing the mundane ins and outs of daily life to expressing thoughts about sex, abortion and suicide.  She would often flit between fact and fantasy; on occasion there was content that was seemingly rather sinister. Edith, an avid reader of fiction, would sometimes imagine herself as a character from a novel and in doing so would hint at wanting to be rid of Percy, perhaps by adding small pieces of glass to his food. In one letter she wrote: Yesterday I met a woman who had lost three husbands and not through the war, two were drowned and one committed suicide, and some people I know can't lose one. How unfair everything is. Bess and Reg are coming to dinner Sunday. Another said: I was buoyed up with the hope of the 'light bulb' and I used a lot - big pieces too - not powdered - and it had no effect - I quite expected to be able to send you that cable - but no - nothing has happened from it. University College London professor René Weis, who has studied the case for decades, believes the letters show no more than the ""workings of an overwrought romantic imagination"".  For Edith, these fantasies would prove to be deadly. On 3 October 1922 Edith and Percy spent the evening watching the comedy The Dippers at the Criterion Theatre near Piccadilly Circus. After the show they boarded a Tube to Liverpool Street before catching a train to Ilford. As they walked along Belgrave Road towards their house, a man barged into the couple. He set upon Percy, who within seconds was lying motionless on the ground. The 32-year-old shipping clerk had sustained several knife wounds to his neck. Daylight would reveal his blood splattered along a 44ft (13m) stretch of the road. A murder investigation was soon under way. Percy's brother told police they should speak to Freddy. The 20-year-old's room in his mother's home was searched and the first of Edith's love letters was found. She too was now under suspicion. In a corridor at Ilford police station, detectives arranged it so that Edith and Freddy would set eyes on one other, in the hope she would incriminate herself. After this encounter, she wailed: ""Why did he do it? I didn't want him to do it. Oh God, oh God, what can I do? I must tell the truth."" His cabin on his ship, the Morea, was searched and more letters were discovered locked in a box, including those that mentioned Edith's apparent desire for Percy to be out of the picture. Freddy did not deny stabbing Percy, but claimed the older man had struck out at him and he had acted in self-defence. When he was told that Edith was also to be charged with murder, Freddy replied: ""Why her? Mrs Thompson was not aware of my movements."" Details from the letters were splashed across the newspapers in reports of the pre-trial hearings. The defendants found themselves at the centre of a storm. ""They were glamourous. They had an almost film-star air to them,"" Ms Thompson says. ""He looked like a Rupert Brooke figure, almost, and she must have had a huge erotic charge about her."" On 6 December 1922, Edith and Freddy were led into a packed courtroom at the Old Bailey for their murder trial.  Crowds had massed early outside the famous London court, with a place in the public gallery the premium seat in the capital. Towards the end of the nine-day trial, unemployed men were lining up outside the building each night and then selling their places in the queue the next morning for more than the average weekly wage in Britain. For writer Beverley Nichols, who was a young reporter at the time and was present throughout the trial, the case had the air of ""the days of the Roman Empire when the Christians were thrown to the lions"". Speaking on a BBC radio programme in 1973, he described how the Old Bailey ""had the atmosphere of a first night"".  ""You had all these people who might be in the dress circle or the stalls; a great many society women, sensation-seekers, and they were all treating it as if it were a thing for which they paid for their seats."" Artists from Madame Tussauds were also in courtroom number one, sketching the two latest villains the attraction hoped to install in its Chamber of Horrors. As crucial evidence for the prosecution, extracts from the love letters were read out in court. Such was the vocal reaction from the public gallery, the jurors were instructed to read the passages to themselves. ""The horror of having them read out in court, that's what kills me - those private, intimate words and the public gallery behaving like crazed lunatics listening to this private, private stuff - it's like trying to torture someone, I think,"" says Ms Thompson. The timing of the case, in the aftermath of World War One, seemed to add to a brewing sense of hatred towards Edith, as Prof Weis explains. ""The narrative went that Britain was full of war widows and here was an uppity and selfish young woman, from a modest background at that, who had everything - looks, a lovely house, money, a good husband, dinners, dances, theatres. And look what she did. One good man wasn't enough for her. ""The public came to admire Freddy and intensely dislike Edith, a siren who had seduced a young man and thus set in motion a chain reaction that resulted in one man's death and the certain execution of a 'lad',"" Prof Weis says. The public's dislike of Edith was evidently shared by the judge, Mr Justice Shearman, who would repeatedly interject on the side of the prosecution. During his summing up, he told the jurors - whom he would only address as gentlemen even though two were women - how he felt about Edith's adultery: ""I am certain that you, like any other right-minded person, will be filled with disgust at such a notion."" The evidence against her was at best flimsy. Percy's body was tested for poison and traces of glass but nothing incriminating was found. Witness accounts supported Edith's assertion she had been taken by surprise on the night her husband was stabbed. Despite her barrister's desperate pleas, Edith took to the stand to give evidence. ""That to me was a sign of innocence, that you would be so adamant that you would want to do that,"" says Ms Thompson. But Edith had made a dreadful mistake. The prosecution manipulated what she had written in the letters, finding false narratives and giving misleading time periods ""to tie her up in knots"". On 11 December the jury went out; a verdict was reached after two hours of deliberations. A terrified Edith was half-carried back into the courtroom to be told she and Freddy had been found guilty of murder.  ""The jury is wrong. That woman is not guilty,"" cried out Freddy amid a commotion in the courtroom. A black cap was placed over Mr Justice Shearman's wig as he sentenced them to death. Edith let out a guttural cry as she was taken down to the cells. A petition to spare Freddy from the hangman's noose received more than a million signatures. Edith, though, seemed not to inspire much sympathy. ""Women disliked her because they feared her; she was one of those women that other women think men fancy, and she was troubling and she couldn't be pitied,"" says Ms Thompson. ""She really never stood a chance."" Opinion pieces appeared in the newspapers, the majority of them scathing. ""There were no circumstances in the case to evoke the slightest sympathy,"" the Times wrote. ""The whole case was simple and sordid."" Self-proclaimed feminist Rebecca West wrote that Edith ""was, poor child, a shocking little piece of rubbish"". After the execution, women would write to Home Secretary William Bridgeman thanking him for defending the honour of their sex by not allowing the death sentence to be commuted. Edith wrote letters from prison, highlighting the anguish of a woman facing obliteration. In one note to her parents she remarked: Today seems the end of everything. I can't think - I just seem up against a blank, thick wall, through which neither my eyes nor my thoughts can penetrate. It's not within my powers of realisation that this sentence must stand for something which I have not done, something I did not know of, either previously or at the time. Every woman sentenced to death during the previous decade had been reprieved, yet pleas on Edith's behalf were rejected. ""When you see the contortions which the Home Office underwent to ensure that she was executed, it's really quite terrifying,"" says Ms Thompson, who believes Edith's adultery was seen as ""an attack on morality"" - the sort of behaviour that risked ""destroying the institution of marriage and destroying all that was good"". In September 1923 an auction of the Thompsons' household goods was held at the marital home, attracting huge interest. One of the auction staff described how ""the privet hedge was left bare of every leaf because the people who attended wanted to say to their friends they had something from the house"". The waxworks of Edith and Freddy were the top attraction at Madame Tussauds, the fascination with the case seemingly inexhaustible.  They were removed from the Chamber of Horrors in the 1980s. The figures are today in storage; their wax degrading, the paint peeled away. Prof Weis has for many years fought to have Edith pardoned. In 2018 her body was reburied alongside her parents at the City of London Cemetery in Manor Park. ""I was hoping to fulfil her mother's dying wishes,"" he says. ""Now at least she is home with them."" For Ms Thompson, Edith's fate remains relevant, even though it is more than 50 years since capital punishment ended in Britain. ""It's important to remind people nothing changes, prejudice always exists; it just shape-shifts. ""There is an awful warning in this story: check your worst impulses towards people to whom you feel prejudice. We live in a cancelling culture - she was literally cancelled - and it's a very, very dangerous impulse but society finds it hard to resist.""

Coventry photographer's archive saved from a skip catalogued by volunteers,"Images saved from a skip, showing the restoration of a city devastated by the blitz, have been identified and catalogued thanks to the work of volunteers. Thousands of photographs taken by Coventry photographer Arthur Cooper from the 1940s up to the 1960s have been digitized and released online by Coventry University. The archive, in the form of thousands of glass negatives, was found dumped on a Coventry street and returned to publishing company Mirrorpix. After sitting at the company's Watford archive for nearly a decade, the 8,049 rescued images have been made available to view as part of the Coventry Digital initiative.  The archive had no information attached, explained the project's director Dr Ben Kyneswood, so he has called on community groups and organisations to help identify people and places to add metadata. ""As soon as I opened the files I thought 'this is just marvellous'. There were just thousands of images with no information on,"" said Martin Williams. The chairman of the Friends of Coventry Cathedral group has so far helped identify and caption about 700 of the pictures. ""It was when I saw early historic photos that I'd never seen before that I got very excited,"" he said.  Images such as rubble from the blitz being cleared from the cathedral in 1948 were ""very important"", he explained.  ""That's just one moment in the history of the cathedral"" that could have been lost.  The pictures depict weddings, award ceremonies and festivals as well as visiting celebrities and royalty and were taken while the photographer worked for publications such as the Midlands Daily News, Birmingham Post and Mail and the Coventry Evening Telegraph. ""I've been involved with Coventry Cathedral since 1962 and so was at many events which Arthur covered as a freelance, so I got to know him,"" said Mr Williams.  ""He was a lovely man, we just got on really well.""  Some time after Mr Cooper's death the thousands of glass plates were found in a skip.  ""My understanding is the family were disposing of the archive some years ago, when someone recognised its worth and organised for its retrieval, ""explained John Mead, archive manager at Mirrorpix owner Reach PLC. ""We recovered about 10,000 glass plates, with the collection predominantly documenting the rebuilding of the city after the war."" The negatives initially went to the Coventry Telegraph archive. Then, as the office closed down in 2012, they were passed to the archivist in Watford.  ""But we couldn't identify who was in these pictures because there was no documentation whatsoever with the archive, all we knew was it was taken by Arthur,"" explained Mr Mead.  The collection is a ""complete time capsule of history of a very specific location"", added Fergus McKenna, content sales director of Reach. The collaboration with Coventry Digital had enabled the company to ""give that collection back to the city and ask the community to engage with it"", he added.  Dr Kyneswood said volunteers had ""loved"" getting involved in identifying people and places in the archive.  More than 10,000 people a month had been accessing and sharing the images, he said, but the project was still working to identify thousands of other people in the collection. Some groups had been able to identify specific vehicles, sporting events and adding the stories behind the picture ""which is when it gets really interesting"", he added.  ""There's a lovely story where the Godiva Harriers' archivist identified a race that ended on Binley School track and it was to allow Coventry runner Brian Kilby to qualify for the Olympics in 1964. ""He spotted somebody in there whose wife Pam connected him to his wife and he's still married to her 54 years later,"" he said.  Users of the Historic Forum had also found some ""very particular stories"", he added.  About a picture of a TVR car taken in 1963, the forum had ""identified the garage, they've identified the man who is standing next to the car - Peter Simpson - and then with a bit more digging they then found the car had just been renovated and so they posted online a picture of the same car"". Rob Orland, founder of the Historic Coventry Forum, said his group with thousands of members had ""risen to the challenge"" of being able to identify a photograph's location or year ""using fragments of what's visible in the picture"". ""I think most of us enjoy a bit of ancient detective work,"" he added.  The work of the community in helping identify the pictures was ""very valuable"", explained Mr McKenna.  The collaboration was helping make the archive searchable, he said.  ""You're going from an asset that was in a dusty old loft to something now that's online and only going to get more discoverable and more shared and more used going forward."" Arthur Cooper's collection was important as it had captured ""a social record of a time and a place that isn't there any more"",  he added.

'I dug up my swimming bullying trauma for nothing',"The closure of an elite swimming club amid allegations of bullying earlier this year caused turmoil in the sport that continues today. As swimmers say they feel lessons have not been learnt, governing body Swim England is facing questions about the protection of its young members. The medal haul that returned to Shropshire after last weekend's Short Course Regionals was impressive - 14 golds, 10 silvers and eight bronze.  It was Ellesmere College Swimming Academy's first competition of the season, one which saw the young swimmers travel to Nottingham to compete. The vast majority of swimmers that train at the rural Shropshire school are now affiliated to City of Leicester Swimming Club, which is based more than 100 miles away in the East Midlands.  The school-run academy has sprung up in place of Ellesmere College Titans, which, in April this year, was forced to disband by Swim England following a lengthy investigation into multiple claims of bullying and emotional abuse.  Swimming's national governing body ruled it would not affiliate any club that was held at Ellesmere College in the future. Instead, weeks after Titans closed, the academy was set up by college bosses and more than 30 of its 45 young members affiliated to City of Leicester, along with three of Ellesmere's coaches.  It seemed like the perfect solution - no ""club"", as such, would be based at the independent school, but swimmers could continue to compete, albeit for a club based in a different part of the country.  But some of those who came forward to allege bullying at Titans have told the BBC it felt like the sanction of no affiliation had been ""circumvented"" and no lessons had been learnt. Danny Proffitt, one of two Titans coaches temporarily suspended as a result of the bullying investigation, is among the new City of Leicester coaches based at the school. ""It feels like a slap in the face because, when you take a step back, nothing has really happened,"" the woman, now in her 20s, told the BBC. ""Everyone that came forward had to dig up their trauma for something to actually be done, and it's like nothing ever happened. ""There have been no shockwaves - it is beyond deflating."" A parent of a former swimmer who also alleged bullying said it felt like their experiences had been ""denied, buried and airbrushed"" by Swim England and the college. ""Years on we are still waiting for adults to stand up and do the right thing - the children have still never had an apology."" The investigation at Titans, which included complaints by male and female swimmers stretching back several years, hit the headlines in 2021 when its director of swimming Alan Bircher, a 10-time British champion and world championship silver medallist, was suspended along with Mr Proffitt.  The nature of the allegations was kept confidential by Swim England. But earlier this year, three ex-Titans swimmers told the BBC they had faced humiliating public weighing regimes that left more than one with an eating disorder, were made to swim despite injuries and illnesses and had a torrent of inappropriate comments made to them during training. Mr Proffitt and Mr Bircher, whose suspension prevented him from coaching Team GB's swimmers at the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2021, have never commented publicly on the allegations.  It sparked a debate on social media in which polar opposite views emerged - the requirement for young gifted swimmers to ""toughen up"" for what is often a brutal competitive environment on one side, with others pointing out that emotional abuse of children is not acceptable in any sport, school or workplace. Swim England, which has more than 100,000 members under 18, is now facing multiple questions over its attitude to safeguarding from parents, coaches and even some from inside the organisation itself.  The BBC understands many coaches are leaving the sport, with claims of a growing ""toxicity"" in which they feel unsupported as they try to navigate the challenges of training children. Sport England is also conducting an independent review into Swim England's own processes, including how it dealt with complainants in the wake of the Titans probe and a separate investigation into a row between coaches and the committee of City of Oxford Swimming Club.  Furthermore, the organisation has come under fire from its recently-departed child safeguarding expert Keith Oddy, who left Swim England in summer shortly after filing a highly-critical report, seen by the BBC, which described a chaotic picture at the organisation.  The former Metropolitan Police officer, who is a child safeguarding expert with British Equestrian and British Rowing, said it had failed to tackle a series of issues including the widespread taking of indecent pictures of children in changing rooms. Mr Oddy, who presided over hundreds of safeguarding cases during his tenure, said Swim England had been slow to conduct its own analysis of the Whyte Review into allegations of mistreatment in gymnastics, which would avoid a similar situation happening in swimming. He also stated workloads in the safeguarding team had become unmanageable after they were furloughed during England's coronavirus lockdowns, when swimming pools closed, and accused senior management of interfering in cases. The governing body had an ""obvious failure to put child protection at the heart of decision making"", he said. ""Swim England is heading for a situation where the protection and safeguarding of children will be placed at risk,"" his report concluded.  Mr Oddy told the BBC he had not heard from the board since issuing his report. Parents of current Ellesmere swimmers told the BBC they welcomed Sport England's investigation. This was echoed by the parent volunteer-led committee of the Oxford club, where all five coaches quit in 2021 in a furious row with management. The committee had started investigating safeguarding complaints made by swimmers, but coaches claimed they were in fact being bullied by those in charge.  Club chairman Nicola Brown said Swim England had given the committee no support despite being asked. ""At every point we asked for help and we never got it,"" she said.  Swim England denied it did not take safeguarding seriously and said it had improved its team by appointing former Surrey Police detective Kevin Suckling as the new head of safeguarding. Investigative journalist Mark Williams-Thomas, also a former detective with Surrey Police and best known for helping to expose Jimmy Savile in an ITV documentary, is understood to be among a panel of investigators the organisation will utilise. In a statement, the organisation said: ""We have made significant improvements to our staffing structure and expertise of the team - including the appointment of a full-time head of safeguarding and welfare as well as establishing two further positions within the department.  ""In addition, under our new structure we have a bank of experienced and highly qualified independent child safeguarding officers, whom we utilise, providing significantly more capacity in this area. ""All changes have been made with the safeguarding and welfare of our members at the forefront."" It added an in-depth piece of work was in progress ""to assess the approach against the outcomes of the Whyte Review"" and added it ""strongly disagreed"" with suggestions bosses interfered in safeguarding cases. In response to coaches leaving the profession, Swim England said it would ""always endeavour to ensure that our coaches' voices are heard"" but that ""we hold our coaches accountable to the highest standards of safe and effective practice, thereby ensuring that our participants enjoy a positive and fulfilling sporting experience."" ""We understand that people will move in and out of the profession and therefore we continually look for ways to ensure that aquatics coaching is a rewarding role."" Regarding Ellesmere swimmers competing for City of Leicester, the governing body said all swimming clubs were free to accept new members, regardless of where they were based. It is understood the Shropshire college denies any suggestions it evaded sanctions. Sport England confirmed a review into Swim England was under way. ""[We have] been made aware of concerns raised in relation to how complaints were handled at a small number of swimming clubs.   ""Safeguarding and welfare in sport is of paramount importance and if complaints are raised, they should be taken very seriously. ""Although we have no regulatory powers in sport, we can explore whether the right processes were followed, and are looking into this matter.""

Payout for sex abuse survivor who says Ellesmere College failed her,"A sex abuse survivor has been paid a substantial sum after claiming school staff failed to protect her when she was raped by her mother's partner. Kim Fawcett became pregnant by Robert Stuart McClelland at 14 while she was a pupil at independent Ellesmere College. She contacted the school more than a decade after the truck driver was jailed in 2004, to see if more could have been done to stop her abuser. The Shropshire college confirmed a payment had been made by insurers. This story contains details of child sexual abuse  Miss Fawcett, a human rights lawyer, said multiple teachers and support staff had known about the allegations of abuse and also claimed her mother's partner had been able to drive on to school premises where he raped her in his van. She fought to access school records which showed at least one member of staff was aware McClelland was sending lewd text messages to the teenager in 2002 when she was 13 . A handwritten note recorded that he had texted to say she was ""so beautiful"" adding ""your mom won't be home tonight, we will be all alone"". ""When you sit on my bed you don't know how it makes me feel,"" the text message added. The existence of the text messages was never disclosed to social services, Miss Fawcett discovered. In correspondence seen by the BBC, the school and its lawyers vigorously challenged her claims against Ellesmere College, saying many were unsubstantiated and the school had done nothing wrong. Miss Fawcett, who has waived her right to anonymity to speak to the BBC, said initially she had had no intention of taking legal action against the school, which charges fees of up to £35,000 a year. But she said repeated rebuttals from longstanding headmaster Brendan Wignall, who told her the school had nothing to apologise for, had forced her to singlehandedly fight on. In letters seen by the BBC, Mr Wignall told her the signs of abuse were ""too subtle"", adding: ""I do not believe the college would act differently if similar events were to happen today."" Miss Fawcett said she could not believe a child in her situation now would be treated the same way. ""I only ended up issuing [starting legal action] because I wanted them to take me seriously,"" Miss Fawcett said. ""I wanted them to listen. ""It was really important to me that lessons were learnt."" Miss Fawcett got a scholarship to the school in 1999, with her fees topped up by her maternal grandparents.  She was described by her teachers as quiet, conscientious and hard-working.  But her home life was complicated and when her mother began a relationship with McClelland it was not long before he began grooming the teenager. She was 13 when he raped her for the first time at his home in Oswestry. Evidence given during his trial heard Miss Fawcett's abuser scratched the date of the assault into a bottle of Smirnoff Ice he had plied her with beforehand. The abuse continued for months and, aged 14, Miss Fawcett discovered she was three months pregnant. McClelland forced her to have an abortion, when she also learned she had contracted a sexually transmitted infection. The schoolgirl told a family friend and eventually found the courage to go to police, who discovered the bottle and text messages McClelland had sent the teenager when they raided his home.  Miss Fawcett, by then 15, gave evidence in his trial at Chester Crown Court and he was jailed for six years, of which he served two.  If you have been affected by the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found via BBC Action Line. In the years that followed, she suffered severe mental health problems as the scale of her ordeal took its toll. A counsellor helping her heal from post traumatic stress disorder, when Miss Fawcett was in her 20s, asked where all the adults in her life had been at the time.  She said she had decided to contact her former school ""to better understand what had happened"".  Miss Fawcett thought she would get answers easily, but what followed was an almost three-year fight. The college said it could not find her nursing records, she was told, and so could not verify her recollection of being treated at the infirmary when she self-harmed. It also said staff members, a number of whom have remained in post since Miss Fawcett was a student in the early 2000s, did not recall her reaching out to ask for help. It did have a record of her missing weeks of lessons, but said this had not raised concerns as her grades had remained good.  The college also recorded concerns raised by a friend's mother about the messages and rumours circulating around the school that Miss Fawcett was being raped.  Social services was contacted, but regarding a separate matter. The college made no mention of concerns around her mother's partner and documents show social services closed the case the same day.  Social workers only became involved again the following year as part of the police investigation. Miss Fawcett's case against Ellesmere College hinged on the argument that if staff and teachers had fulfilled their safeguarding responsibilities, their intervention could have spared her months of abuse and a lifetime of mental health issues. In 2003, the school's own child protection policy dictated staff should be alert to signs of abuse, with particular attention paid to attendance and changes in behaviour, and that accurate records needed to be kept in a secure place.  Between 2017 and 2018, Ms Fawcett wrote to the college looking for answers, often waiting months for a response. She said correspondence had felt ""as if they were dealing with some unfortunate individual making an embarrassing scene"". Eventually, she contacted the Information Commissioner to get her records. As well as the notes about the texts, they included a letter from McClelland to the school in which he claimed Miss Fawcett was ""sorry for wasting your time"" after telling a ""few little white lies"" - another reference to staff being aware of what was happening. Miss Fawcett issued the start of legal proceedings, outlining her claims concerning the college in full. In response, the college described her allegations as ""vague"" and said other agencies such as her GP and social services had failed. The college's legal team also wrote to Miss Fawcett saying: ""We do not accept that our client's alleged failure to report to social services your uneasiness with McClelland or the text messages which he allegedly sent you, resulted in abuse taking place.  ""The abuse would have occurred anyway,"" they said. ""This is clearly a very sad matter,"" lawyers concluded. ""We accept that you want to find retribution, and that you wish to hold to account the adults who, you say, failed to protect you as a child... but consider that your allegations against [the college] are misplaced."" Eventually in 2020, the college's insurers settled out of court - without an admission of liability - and paid Miss Fawcett an undisclosed sum.  In response to questions from the BBC, the college said its investigation had ""found no grounds to support the suggestion that the college could have done anything differently at the time"". ""The college was desperately saddened to hear about the terrible abuse that Kim Fawcett had suffered, and carefully and thoroughly investigated her complaint as soon as it was received,"" it added. Miss Fawcett described her dealings with the college as akin to gaslighting and said she felt de-humanised.  ""I felt that the school's approach was that if a child was displaying signs of distress, it was because the child was weak or somehow defective,"" she said. In recent years she has built a network with fellow survivors and said a document produced by her friend, design researcher Sophia Luu, which details how people can find the strength to speak out about abuse, could be a lifeline for many. ""I try and tell myself, with the MeToo movement and so much work going on around women's rights, that things are changing,"" Miss Fawcett said. ""But institutions still exist that protect these people and that's devastating. ""There are still children who are lost and alone out there and have no-one to turn to.""

"Domestic abuse protection orders ""absolutely pointless"" say victims","Court orders to protect domestic violence victims from their attackers are ""not worth the paper they're written on"", the BBC has been told. Survivors have called for tougher measures, including electronic tagging, saying a lack of enforcement means orders provide little deterrent. BBC analysis of government data showed prosecutions for breaching some orders have fallen by 40% in recent years. Senior police officers have apologised, saying: ""We want to do better"". Victoria, not her real name, was forced to move counties to get away from her violent ex-husband. During their six-year marriage she was isolated from her family and friends and subjected to physical attacks, one of which led to a miscarriage, she said. At one point, she was ""only eating three digestive biscuits a day"" to try to fulfil her husband's idea of what her body shape should be. When she finally left him in 2016, she had three non-molestation orders (NMOs) put in place consecutively. But, she said, the orders were ""absolutely pointless"" with her abuser repeatedly turning up at her house. ""It took a lot of courage to leave him. I had to uproot my life and move. I shouldn't have to do that, I should be protected,"" she said. ""There's been no support from any professionals and police didn't take the orders seriously."" Victoria said when her ex appeared in court after being arrested for a breach he was told by the judge not to do it again and freed. That set the tone for a string of breaches, which went unpunished, she said. Restraining, non-molestation, and occupation orders are all civil orders designed to protect victims from their abusers. It is a criminal offence to breach the terms of these orders. A domestic violence protection notice (DVPN) is issued by police to provide immediate protection while police officers apply to the magistrates for a domestic violence protection order (DVPO). However, a breach of a DVPN or a DVPO is a civil rather than a criminal offence. When granted by a court, terms can include bans like stopping an offender contacting a person or being within a certain distance of their home or workplace. The Home Office is set introduce a two-year pilot scheme for a civil Domestic Abuse Protection Order in 2023, to replace the DVPN and DVPO in a bid to ""provide longer-term protection for victims"", the government said. Under the scheme, electronic monitoring or tagging could be imposed to monitor a perpetrator in complying with certain terms of the order. Kath, also not her real name, left her husband following nine years of physical and coercive abuse and has had an NMO in place since December, which he breached, she says. ""That non-molestation order isn't worth the paper it's written on,"" she said. ""It don't make any difference whatsoever because it's certainly not made him stay away."" She also cited a lengthy wait for legal aid funding as one of the obstacles in obtaining the order promptly. Deborah Jones, from Barnsley, who set up support group Resolute to help survivors, said the orders were failing victims because there was ""no deterrent at all for a perpetrator to breach them numerous times, over and over again"".  ""They get clever and very aware of the legal system,"" she said. ""They know that there's no real consequences to breaching them. ""Things need to change. There needs to be tougher consequences if an order is breached, perpetrators should be tagged."" According to data gathered by the BBC, figures from the HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services and the Ministry of Justice show: The Independent Domestic Abuse Services (IDAS) charity said many survivors felt breaches ""are not acted upon"", which in in turn undermined their confidence in the police and prevented further breaches from being reported. IDAS's Carmel Offord said a 2018 review led by the charity found the way authorities worked left ""significant safeguarding black holes"". The charity has been working alongside North Yorkshire Police on a pilot scheme, which allows officers to record orders centrally on the police national database and access relevant details when breaches occur, says Ms Offord. ""I think it really comes down to everybody working in collaboration with the safeguarding of victims, survivors and their children at the heart,"" she said.  ""We can't just assume that a perpetrator isn't high risk because there isn't violence or they haven't done something that we would deem to be risky."" Emma, not her real name, said she was subjected to ""seven years of absolute cruelty and torment"" by her ex-husband. She had a DVPO and then an NMO put in place from 2017 but, she says, he repeatedly breached them. She said ""nothing was done"" when she reported the breaches to police and he even rented a flat as close as he could get to her home without breaking the terms of the NMO. ""My ex-husband had made threats to kill me,"" the mother-of-two said. ""I was just constantly looking over my shoulder all the time. ""Pulling into a car park, if his van or car was there, I would have to drive away. Just constantly living like that. ""We were just petrified, fearing for our lives. We didn't feel safe whatsoever. We were just waiting for something to happen."" The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) lead for domestic abuse, Louisa Rolfe, said she was sorry that victims ""have not had a service they should expect and deserve from policing so far"".  ""But we are working on this. It is a priority, and we want to get so much better at it,"" she added. Ms Rolfe, an assistant commissioner with the Metropolitan Police, said forces were using DVPOs effectively and a domestic abuse training programme meant officers nationally were being equipped to understand and ""identify high-risk behaviour"". Breaches required a multi-agency approach, including the Crown Prosecution Service, she said. ""We want to support victims. We want to ensure their safety. This is a huge priority for policing, and we are really clear that we expect officers to take positive action."" If you've been affected by the issues raised in this report, details of organisations offering information and support are available via BBC Action Line. However, the Centre for Women's Justice (CWJ) said they had seen little improvement from UK forces following recommendations it had put forward since lodging a super-complaint in April 2019. The action addressed alleged failings by police in their use of protective measures to safeguard victims and was subsequently upheld by three policing bodies.  The charity has asked Domestic Abuse Commissioner Nicole Jacobs to approach all police and crime commissioners (PCC) to hold forces to account. Ms Jacobs said she was ""very concerned about poor enforcement of protective orders"". The CWJ is also calling for improved data gathering around breaches. When the BBC submitted freedom of information (FOI) requests to all 46 UK police constabularies, of the 34 who provided data each responded with differing or partial information. The NPCC said the use of different IT systems by police forces meant collating statistics was a ""challenge"" but added that there was a ""move to a more digital justice system"". Nogah Ofer, a solicitor at the CWJ, said there was also a lack of ""measurable outcomes"" and police training on domestic abuse did not include protection orders. ""It's not really apologies that we're looking for,"" she said. ""We're just looking for improvements on the ground and for victims to get a better service.""

Yordanos Brhane: How teenager's dream of security turned to tragedy,"Yordanos Brhane was 15 years old when she fled Eritrea, crossing Africa and Europe in the hope of finding a better life and re-uniting with her family. Years later, the long and difficult journey brought her to the UK, where she was fatally stabbed just months after settling. Yordanos's sister has spoken about how a young woman's dream of security ended in tragedy.  Deeply religious and with a flair for languages, Yordanos Brhane had just started to build a life for herself in Birmingham. She, along with six of her siblings, left Eritrea, one of Africa's poorest countries and one where people regularly flee political persecution and forced conscription.  ""Yordanos was a very quiet girl, she was polite, courteous, she was on the quiet side rather than very active,"" Kisanet Brhane said of her younger sister. ""She was happy, she was learning the language very quickly, she was very good with languages. She had made friends from Eritrea and I sensed she was settling in nicely."" Her family, when they came to the shared house in Unett Street after her death, found she had joined the city's library and had got herself a provisional driving licence. She had also found herself a job, helping out at a nearby shop where her manager, Sogi Omrani, said she was a beautiful and honest person who was always happy and smiling and all about helping her family. ""She was a nice worker. She had only been here a short amount of time but she talked so nicely. She was very good at English,"" he said. ""All our customers, when they heard she had died, they were crying. I cried too, it was very bad."" Kisanet was seven years older than her sister, but the two had a close bond. ""From the day that she left Eritrea until two days before she died, every day we were in contact, we were very close and every day I was speaking to her.  ""The last two days of her life I hadn't spoken to her."" Kisanet lives in Norway, having left Eritrea in 2014, aged 19. Since moving there, she has studied, worked in care homes and recently gave birth. Her own journey, which took her through the African countries of Ethiopia, Sudan, Libya and then the European countries of Italy, Germany, Sweden and Norway, took her a year. Source: BBC Monitoring ""The journey was very, very difficult, especially when crossing the Sahara Desert in Libya, it was the toughest, it was very, very tough, its not easy at all - you risk your life to go through this journey,"" she said. In March 2017, aged 15, Yordanos began the same arduous journey. Her journey was similar to her sister's but took longer. She was in Libya for seven month where, her sister says, it was a miracle she got out alive. ""She didn't have a good time there it was very, very dangerous, very bad, she experienced really bad things,"" she said. Yordanos and her fellow travellers slept on floors in warehouses, among hundreds of people, with no privacy, a scarce amount of food and no access to medication or sanitary hygiene, she said. The threat of violence and rape was always prevalent. Kisanet believes it was only because by then Yordanos was so weak and ill she was not assaulted. By the time Yordanos got into Europe, she was very ill indeed, arriving into Italy on a stretcher. She had been rescued by the authorities after the boat she came across on, via smugglers, stopped working in the middle of the ocean. ""Her illness was mainly due to malnourishment and very bad scabies infections in her skin which had given her a fever. She had bad problems with her chest, her heart was beating very hard,"" Kisanet said. ""She was really weak by the time she arrived in Italy. We didn't find out straight away she was in Italy - two weeks later we found out she was in hospital where she was getting treatments to get her energy back and help her survive."" But as she was being given treatment to get her better, other problems were about to begin. Yordanos managed to make it to Norway where she was allowed to spend time with Kisanet as well as living in a camp. However, while going through the process it was discovered she had been 'fingerprinted' in Italy.  According to regulations, the first country an asylum seeker enters is ultimately responsible for the individual's asylum application. In effect, officials could tell her first EU country of entry was Italy and could be the one she would be returned to. And that is what happened - the authorities in Norway decided to return her to Italy. The sisters were shocked. ""She had been really happy, she was in a safe environment where human right is protected,"" Kisanet said. ""She was really serious about her education and she improved her language so well. I have lived here two years ahead of her, I couldn't speak better than her. ""She was really optimistic about life and she didn't expect to be sent back to Italy."" The news was hard for them both to take in. ""Especially as her age, she was only 16, I was older than her, I could have taken care of her, I was her family, her sister. What they did was wrong. She was only 16. To be separated from her family at that age."" Yordanos was taken back to Italy within the week, leaving the family with little chance to appeal. After a few days living rough and begging for food, she made the journey to Belgium and made contact with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), which, because of her age, picked up her case and began to argue she should be able to return to Norway.  Norway accepted her return, while her case was being resolved, and again she stayed with her brother, who lived in a different part of Norway, and also in a camp. ""After three months the charity gave her the letter to take to police to say she is back from Italy and she has this letter to say she should have her case looked at properly,"" Kisanet said. ""But the police put her in prison for two months. They would not let her go. They said they did not accept it and that she should go back to Italy. She was forced to return to Italy. ""It was the same situation, she was left to fend for herself at such a young age. It was very distressing for her."" Her lawyer in Norway, Andre Mokkelgjerd, said the Dublin Regulation, which regulates which country is responsible for processing an asylum application, does have discretionary clauses which made it possible for Norway to consider allowing her to remain - particularly as she was a vulnerable young woman alone in Europe with family in Norway. ""Unfortunately, our arguments along these lines were not given decisive weight, and the general rules were applied strictly as they often are in these cases,"" he said. Yordanos went back to Belgium, living rough, for seven months; although Kisanet says she did get help from some Belgian charities. And when she eventually made it to the UK, on the back of a lorry, the charity workers stayed in contact. ""They were really nice, very close to Yordanos, and they were happy she came to a safe country. They came to visit her twice,"" Kisanet said. After a year in the UK, Yordanos was granted to leave to remain with refugee status. She was 18 when she arrived. The family found out she had died through social media.  ""I didn't know what happened, it was my sister who contacted me, she had seen something on Instagram. ""She said 'what am I hearing - have you spoken to Yordanos?' and I said 'no I haven't spoken to her for two days, what happened?'"" Kisanet and her husband were able to contact some of Yordanos's friends. They heard Yordanos was no longer alive, there had been an accident. They later had to come over to the UK to identify the body. ""With the shock of the news, we quickly arranged for three siblings including myself to come to the UK to identify the body.  ""When we arrived, there were a lot of Eritrean community helping us out. They prepared accommodation where we could stay and they were very helpful to us,"" she said. She was unable to make the journey for Yordanos's killer's court case. Halefom Weldeyohannes, from Sheffield, has been jailed for at least 21 years for her murder. But the family said 21 years was not enough. Yordanos's older brother Gezae Birhane Kibedom said: ""I am not happy, Yordanos was a nice girl. He hurt my sister, he took a life, it's not enough."" He had been in contact with Yordanos three days before she died. She told him she had started to learn to drive and also her plans for the future. ""She wanted to go back to school, she wanted to become a doctor or a nurse and then ultimately she wanted to go back to Eritrea where, depending on the government, she would try to help our family and other young people. ""Yordanos was so young but old for her age."" Additional reporting by Allen Cook Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, and sign up for local news updates direct to your phone.

Olympic village: From athletes' digs to shiny new town,"In a once-neglected corner of east London, a shiny new town has been born.    Historically scarred by deprivation, this part of Stratford, in the borough of Newham, is now home to financiers, lawyers and creatives.   East Village, as it's been branded, oozes with prosperity. It's Instagrammable. Its postcode, E20, is London's ""hippest"", according to its owner, Get Living. Just outside the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park - the home of the 2012 Olympics - spartan accommodation blocks first built to house competing athletes are now hot property.  Having been converted into flats in 2013, people began to make their homes here. Row after row of 60-odd almost identical mid-rise apartment blocks stretch from the aptly named Victory Parade to the north, and Anthems Way and Celebration Avenue to the east.  A street lined with independent cafes and bars overlooks Victory Park, which dazzles with cherry blossom in the spring and is strewn with picnic rugs in the summer.   ""It has a nice villagey feel, it's very neighbourly. Yeah, we love it here,"" says Fawn Hudgens, who rents a two-bedroom flat with her baby daughter and her partner, who runs a digital marketing company.  ""Everything's on your doorstep, so it's very easy.""  In East Village, you can be at one with nature by taking a wetlands walk, tuck into some posh grub from the upmarket deli or gelateria, or indulge in the high fashion on offer at the nearby Westfield shopping centre.   Perhaps more desirable still are the transport links offered by the newly opened Elizabeth line and Stratford International station, which have fast lines to the rest of the capital and beyond.   A calendar of events including a weekly street food market, summer fete, book clubs, homework clubs, and fitness classes create opportunities for the 7,000 villagers to mix.   ""Over time you start getting to know people, especially if you have kids; there's lots of stuff going on,"" said Ms Hudgens. ""And it's easy to make friends through that.  ""I've got mum friends in the neighbourhood now, which is fantastic.""  This new neighbourhood even has its own village hall where Ms Hudgens takes her daughter to mother and baby groups.   East Village has sprouted from seeds sown in the early 2000s, when plans were made to revitalise parts of east London left behind by redevelopment of London's Docklands in the 1980s and 90s.  When the Olympics came to town, this site became a key focus for regeneration as part of a lasting legacy of the 2012 Games. Central to that was the idea it would deliver thousands of new homes.  That, it has done - there are 3,800 new homes here with more to follow.  But East Village is more than bricks and mortar - it is a large community built from scratch, says Get Living's chief executive officer Rick de Blaby.  ""It was amazing vision and foresight to think you could do it on this scale,"" he said, ""because no-one had really done it before.""  What is happening here, he says, is ""placemaking"". According to Mr de Blaby, ""we don't have to ourselves build the community, we create the stage on which the people who live here build their own community"".  The ""stage"" includes free kids' football coaching sponsored by Get Living. The company has also forgone retail rent by creating a low-cost community workspace, the E20 Lab, in one of its units.   It's all part of vision to ""really create an environment in which people genuinely put down roots and thrive"", he said.  It may not be organic, but, Mr de Blaby says, ""it's becoming organic"".  But while Get Living curates many aspects of life here, it says its tenants are increasingly forming independent social groups. Dog-walkers, nature lovers, and LGBTQ+ residents are said to be bonding over common ground.  However, most people who call East Village home haven't made long-term commitments to stay here. This is, in the main, a rental scheme, and the average length of tenure is 22 months, according to Get Living.  The company, a partnership between real estate investment and advisory firm Delancy and Qatari Diar - the investment arm of Qatar's ruling family - bought the site from the UK government in 2011, and later promised to ""transform the way Londoners rent"".  ""You would hear resident refrains around insecurity of tenure, and big fees and security deposits and poor repairs, and the distant landlord and lots of intermediaries, and the rest of it that wasn't working for renters,"" Mr de Blaby says.  ""So the vision was to really disrupt that and give people a much better experience. And we've largely done that."" Get Living says it offers renters three-year tenancies, charges no fees, provides free broadband, allows residents to keep pets and to redecorate.   What's more, tenants are no longer required to pay large security deposits. That really turned heads, he says.  For Mr de Blaby, East Village is a ""build-to-rent"" success story. ""It was an enterprising call to be able to do it. And, you know, it's come off brilliantly.""  The company, backed by pension funds, has just launched its latest builds, offering modern high-rise living across 524 flats. At 26 and 31 storeys high, the two new towers soar into the sky.   As well as ""stunning"" apartments, the blocks have a cinema room, built-in wine dispensers, and an elevated ""sky bridge"", which is a ""leafy oasis of wellness"".  These follow the arrival of the Victory Plaza in 2019 - 481 luxury flats spread across two imposing skyscrapers, which transformed the landscape of East Village, a previously mid-rise scheme.  Here, tenants enjoy exclusive rooftop gardens, ""high-spec"" Danish-designed interiors, faster broadband than their mid-rise neighbours, and ""spectacular views"" from floor-to-ceiling windows. Creative types can take to the painting studio for a spot of art, while gardening tools are laid on for green-fingered residents in the communal potting shed.  It does, of course, all come at a price.  A studio flat in Portlands Place will set you back £1,885 a month, while you'll need £4,100 a month to rent a four-bedroom family home here.  A two-bedroom flat in the former athletes' blocks can cost upwards of £2,300 a month, while three-bedroom flats here are available for £2,700 a month.  For Ms Hudgens, cost could be a deciding factor in whether she and her family put down roots here. ""We'd love to stay in the neighbourhood, but I don't think it is long term. And a lot of people feel the same way. I know a lot of people are saying, 'If we want to have a bigger family, we need to move out a little further.'""  She believes the cost of living in East Village has created an exclusive neighbourhood that doesn't feel like the rest of Stratford, a historically deprived area.  ""There's a definite divide. You can see that, you know, some people have been left behind on the other side of the railway bridge.  ""Normal people have been priced out of this area. I know. It was very much promised to be, you know, a place for people who are from Stratford. And that hasn't happened. Which is a shame.""  An NHS worker living in East Village who gave his name as Steve told BBC London: ""It's not inclusive at all.  ""It is full of young professionals, lots of tech. Lots of students that have some other funds coming from somewhere; I think they call it 'bank of mum and dad'. ""I think a lot of people are priced out of rentals.""  However, there is more to the East Village story than the luxury of the top of Victory Plaza.  The East Village has delivered 675 social homes that have gone to families on the council housing list - this is more social housing than any other residential scheme to spring up as part of the 2012 Olympics legacy. A further 48 social homes are under construction. These are among the 1,379 homes in the affordable housing stock, managed by leaseholder Triathlon Homes, a joint public and private sector venture.  Some are rented out at about 20% lower than the market rate and many are offered as part of a shared ownership deal. This has enabled people such as Nigel Godfrey, who runs a theatre company, to take their first step on to the property ladder.  ""That was helpful for financial reasons, because theatre is not particularly well paid,"" said Mr Godfrey, who initially bought a 50% share in his flat, but has gradually increased that share to 100%.  ""It meant I could live in London, it meant I could afford to have two bedrooms, which I needed for my family circumstances. And it meant that I was secure for a while:  as long as I could keep paying my mortgage, I wasn't going to get turfed out by my landlord, as had happened multiple times over the preceding 10, 15 years.""  Mr Godfrey, who was one of the first people to move into East Village, added that while ""it's a good place to live"", it isn't the tight-knit community it started out as.  ""At the beginning, when there was a tiny group of us, lots of people got to know each other. And that was good."" But he said that ""now it feels more like a normal part of London"", because the village has grown. In the coming years, East Village is to expand further. Two more large towers will bring another 850 flats on to the rental market.  Get Living hopes to develop a third tower of 520 student rooms and an exhibition space, to bring young creatives to live at East Village while they study at a campus planned by the London College of Fashion. And, Mr de Blaby hopes, that by creating the ""right environment"" for these people, they might stay for good.   ""We've really gone on a mission to make this a hub for creative enterprise,"" he said.  Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

London Olympics: Residents 'betrayed' over housing promise,"The provision of affordable housing in some of the poorest parts of London after the 2012 Olympics has fallen far short of pledges made, the BBC has found. There was a promise to regenerate areas of east London for the ""direct benefit"" of residents - a key feature in the capital's bid to host the Games.  Originally, 9,000 homes were to be built on the former Olympic Park, half of them affordable for local people.  But fewer than 200 new homes built are offered at the cheapest levels of rent.  A decade on from the Games, which cost £9bn to host, about 1,200 homes have been built on the site, most of which, it is claimed, are unattainable for many people in the area.  The planning authority responsible for development on the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and surrounding areas, the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), said affordable housing targets had changed with different mayoralties. It also said many political decisions on housing provision in the area pre-dated its formation. The promises have ""melted away"", said Nick Sharman, who until recently sat on the LLDC's planning committee. ""They have been betrayed, no question about it."" In 2005, ""the deal was very clear"" when London's first directly elected mayor Ken Livingstone championed the Olympics coming to the capital, said Mr Sharman, who was at the time in charge of regeneration at the London Development Agency.   ""He [Mr Livingstone] said: 'This is going to be the regeneration Olympics' - in other words, it's going to have a real legacy for the people of east London.""  The official bid to host the Games, which was led by London 2012 chair Lord Coe, said that ""the most enduring legacy of the Olympics will be the regeneration of an entire community for the direct benefit of everyone who lives there"".  At the time, the area had some of the most deprived council wards in England. At the heart of Mr Livingstone's legacy pledge was that 50% of any housing built would be affordable, said Mr Sharman.  Mr Sharman added that it was ""those commitments that really inspired the enthusiasm, I think, of the Olympic Committee, but certainly the wider population"". Mr Livingstone told the BBC that had he not lost the London mayoralty to Boris Johnson, he would have ensured the 50% affordable housing pledge was kept. Ten years after the Games, the former Olympic Park in Stratford and its surroundings are the focus of a vast regeneration programme, led by the LLDC.  ""Instead of being the diverse community that Ken Livingstone promised, a model of social inclusion, we're getting the exact reverse,"" said Mr Sharman. On the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, where many of the events were held in 2012, just under 1,200 homes have been built. Only 37% of these are officially classed as affordable, rather than the promised 50%. Chobham Manor, a development of 880 homes next to the Lee Valley Velo Park, is an ""incredible new neighbourhood"", according to developer Taylor Wimpey.   It includes 169 social and affordable rent (low-cost) homes. However, a third of units classed as affordable are offered as shared-ownership properties. This is a scheme that aims to make it ""possible for first-time buyers and families to get on to the property ladder"", according to the housing association managing the homes. Recently, 25% shares in two and three-bedroom flats were advertised. These homes required a minimum income of £69,000 a year to buy - well over twice the £29,000 median annual salary for residents of Newham. Of the homes currently on the park under the banner of ""affordable"", 57% are ""intermediate"" - either offered as shared ownership, or for rent at about 75% of the market rate.  However, according to masterplan for the park in 2011, only 40% of the affordable housing stock should have been intermediate, while 60% was supposed to have been made up of social or low-cost rental homes.  It's ""gentrification"", says Rudy Smith, who has spent much of her life in Newham. She and her three-year-old son are among the 33,000 households on the council's housing list.  ""It looks like we're generating wealth, helping the community, but actually you're not helping the community.  ""It's a façade,"" added Ms Smith, who with her son is among about 5,700 families that have been placed in temporary accommodation by Newham Council.  They live in a ""tiny"" flat in which they share a bed, she said.   ""It's not even suitable for me if I was a single person, let alone as someone with a child.""  Rudy says she is worried the council might only be able to offer her a permanent home away from the area.  ""I know someone personally, they've had to move to Clacton-on-Sea. Her family is in Newham and partly in Hackney. She's the only one down there in Clacton-on-Sea, you know, so it's a reality for some people and I hope it doesn't have to be an actual reality for me.""  Like Ms Smith, Godfrey Muhoozi, a father of two from Stratford, cannot afford to rent a home privately. He says he has been on Newham Council's housing list for four years.  ""It's a nightmare,"" he said. His family currently lives in a two-bedroom flat, with his teenage daughter and teenage son sharing a bedroom.  ""It's not good, them being the age they are, especially for my daughter. ""I thought about trying to set up a partition in the room so they have some privacy, but even that is very expensive and I can't afford it.""  Mr Muhoozi and Ms Smith are among 70,000 people on council housing lists across the four hosting boroughs of the 2012 Olympics  - Newham, Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Waltham Forest.  ""It is really quite shocking,"" according to academic and east London housing expert Dr Penny Bernstock. She has interviewed families living in ""terrible"" conditions near the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. ""It's the most extreme housing misery you can imagine - you know, people living in damp, miserable accommodation with a lack of light; children moving multiple times.""  It was addressing the ""misery"" of historically impoverished east London that was central to the Olympic bid, Dr Bernstock said.  ""We have built mainly market housing in an area of acute housing need. This is particularly problematic, given that addressing deprivation, including housing deprivation, was a key dimension of  London's bid."" The concept of affordable housing on the former Olympic Park was always ""slippery"" in any case, according to Dr Bernstock. ""We're building too many intermediate units and not enough social rented units. And so the people that are going to benefit are not going to be the average people living in the area, they're going to be wealthier people from outside."" Dr Bernstock, who is from east London, said the former Olympic Park now has parallels with Canary Wharf, a financial and residential district in the historically deprived borough of Tower Hamlets. ""You've got this wealth in the middle and you've got the poverty around, and that poverty scenario has not changed,"" she said.  However, Dr Bernstock added that she believed there had been some recent improvements in terms of affordable housing provision on the park. The LLDC said all such homes on the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park had so far gone to local people.  By 2035, a total of 5,426 homes are scheduled to have been built on the former Olympic Park, according to the LLDC, rather than the 9,000 originally proposed.   The residential ambitions were altered 2014, when plans were made for the East Bank quarter. This will see branches of the V&A museum, Sadler's Wells theatre, the BBC and the London College of Fashion arrive in Stratford in the coming years. The LLDC said it believed this would be of more long-term benefit to the area than additional homes. However, according to Dr Bernstock, this approach ""compromised"" any affordable housing plans.   Instead of the 2,600 homes originally planned for one site on the park, 600 homes will be built, and the Stratford Waterfront development will consist only of shared-ownership flats.  ""This is 0% affordable housing,"" said Dr Bernstock. A formal legal agreement on such housing as part of the legacy of the 2012 Olympics should have been made before the Games, she added.  When all the housing schemes on the park have been completed, 40% will be classed as affordable, including a mixture of tenures, the LLDC said.  The planning authority, set up by Boris Johnson when he was London's mayor to develop the area post-Olympics, has overseen the construction of about 11,500 new homes since 2012, including those in the park itself. Despite 2012 City Hall guidance that 40% of legacy homes should be affordable, the LLDC said only 24% of them were, with 12% being categorised as low-cost.  The legacy scheme to deliver the most social housing so far is the East Village in Stratford.  Triathlon Homes manages 675 social homes on the site, which originally housed Olympic athletes and was later converted into flats. A further 48 social homes are under construction there. While this is welcomed, it should however be balanced against the previous loss of low-cost housing in the area, according to Dr Piero Corcillo, an urban regeneration expert at Birkbeck University, who completed a PhD on social mixing at East Village. ""We also need to consider that in order to build the Olympic Park, a social housing estate, the Clays Lane Estate, was demolished and that provided 425 housing units,"" he said.  Of the 3,800 homes on the site, the majority are offered at market-rate rent by property company Get Living, which says it ""looks to respond to the acute need for new homes in central London"". Two-bedroom flats in the East Village can be rented out for upwards of £2,300 a month. Built with public money, the site was to have been 50% affordable housing, according to plans drawn up several years before the Games.  ""This hasn't been delivered,"" said Dr Corcillo, who added that ""there's no mechanism to bring decision-makers to account"".  The development is not socially inclusive, he said, and is instead ""definitely geared towards the middle classes, and the better-off fraction of the working class"". When the East Village development is complete, 30% of the homes will be affordable, according to Get Living, which says it has fulfilled its affordable housing obligations. Elsewhere, large developments have sprung up in parts of Stratford such as Chobham Farm, as well as in Hackney Wick, Fish Island and Bromley-by-Bow.  Mr Sharman, who was until recently a Hackney councillor, said he believed his area had been transformed into a ""middle-class barracks"".  Many of the new homes are attracting affluent couples from outside the area, he said, adding: ""When they start having more than one child, almost certainly they will move out. ""I think what comes hardest is that we put so much money into the Olympics, made it a great Games, a fantastically inclusive Games; the legacy of that money has been simply to benefit this narrow band of people. And it didn't have to be that way."" Mr Sharman believes what has happened is a ""microcosm"" of a wider housing problem in the capital: ""The London housing market is not catering for Londoners.""  The LLDC has to cope with a ""fatally flawed"" model, as it inherited the debt for hosting the Games, he believes. It has, Mr Sharman says, an ""impossible job"".  ""They were charged with developing the area, and maximising the land value of it, in order to repay the loans and the subsidies,"" he said. ""So they had two things that are in contradiction, and you can't be both gamekeeper and poacher.  ""And that is the fundamental problem.""  Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Brenda Venables: The 40-year mystery of the missing farmer's wife,"For 40 years, the disappearance of Brenda Venables had been a mystery in the rural Worcestershire village where she had lived. Finally, her family have some answers after her husband - who was living a double life with his mistress - was found guilty of her murder. Brenda Bolton was 23 when she met the man who would become her husband at a young farmers event in Worcestershire.  Both from rural communities, they connected straight away. She was kind, unassuming and ""good company"", David Venables would later tell the jury on his murder trial.  They ""just got on well together"", he added. After that first meeting at Droitwich Winter Gardens, Mr Venables juggled his time seeing her at her home in the tiny village of Rushock, with work on his family's pig farm. He would stop in for breakfast on the way home from dawn trips taking produce from the farm to Birmingham wholesale market. They married in June 1960, before a honeymoon in Jersey, and later moved in together at Quaking House Farm in Kempsey. Mr Venables' father had given him the land to build their marital home, which the couple moved into a year later.  There, Mr Venables farmed pigs and the pair enjoyed a ""magnificent view"" of the surrounding countryside. To outsiders, their life seemed simple yet idyllic. But on 3 May, 1982, Brenda Venables vanished.  Mr Venables reported it to police the following day.  The previous day, he said, had been perfectly normal, with them sowing potatoes. His wife had also ""seemed to be enjoying playing with the puppy"" on the hearth rug and he noticed nothing unusual in her mood that evening, or after they went to bed. ""I just woke up to find she had gone,"" he told a journalist from the Worcester Evening News. ""She has never done anything like this before and I haven't the faintest idea what has happened to her."" He said he had been ""unable to sleep"" since she went missing, adding that his wife had been suffering from depression as a result of a recent bout of flu. The village of Kempsey was soon overrun as the search for Mrs Venables got under way. West Mercia Police used a helicopter to aid with the search and tracker dogs checked farm buildings and derelict properties, but no trace of her was found.  Vicky Jennings, a friend of the couple, later recounted Mr Venables ""did not seem overly concerned"", and ""didn't appear to be actively searching for his wife"". David Harrison, now a councillor on Malvern Hills District Council, ran the Farmer's Arms pub on Bestmans Lane in Kempsey at the time. ""Everybody was surprised, it is the same with any person that goes missing, it becomes the talk of the village,"" he said. ""There was lots of speculation and lots of things put forward and lots of rumours."" A police search, he said, lasted two or three weeks, covering a four or five-mile area around Kempsey up to the M50 motorway, including his own nine acres of land.  ""[There was] a great deal of police, coming round searching everywhere to see if there was anything anywhere that would lead to finding her,"" he said. ""They cut back all the growth on the ditches to see if there was anything in the ditches."" For almost 40 years, Mrs Venables' family was left without a single answer about what happened to her. Until July 2019, when human remains were found in a septic tank in the grounds of Quaking House Farm. The new owners of the farm - Mr Venables had moved out in 2014 - wanted the tank serviced.  To the horror of engineer Alistair Pitt, he found a ""large clump of hair"" before uncovering a human skull.  A pelvis and thigh bones were also recovered - although it was impossible to determine cause of death. Remnants of clothing including half a pair of knickers, a pair of tights, a bra, remains of some shoes and a sweater were also in the tank. At the time of the discovery, a search was ongoing just seven miles away for estate agent Suzy Lamplugh, who disappeared in London in 1986. A site near Pershore had been identified after new information arose following a search the previous year of a property in Sutton Coldfield, which once belonged to the mother of prime suspect John Cannan. But police said there was no link between the remains and Miss Lamplugh. It took more than a year until detectives announced the bones had formally been identified as those of Mrs Venables, and her husband, who was then 88, was charged with her murder. At his trial, details of his double life were revealed, as prosecutors told how he had been in a long-term on-off relationship with his mother's carer Lorraine Styles since around 1967. But even though Mrs Styles had died in 2017, a statement she had given to police in 1984 after Mrs Venables had disappeared was read to the court.  She said the day after he reported his wife missing to police he had telephoned her. ""He seemed quite composed and suddenly told me his wife had disappeared the night before and he was phoning to let me know before I read it in the paper,"" her statement said. ""He called round about two weeks later but didn't mention it. ""I couldn't understand how he was so calm about the whole episode."" Prosecutor Michael Burrows QC told jurors he wanted Mrs Venables ""out of the way"". ""He wanted to resume his long-standing affair with another woman,"" he said.  ""He knew about the septic tank in its secluded location. It was for him almost the perfect hiding place. ""And for nearly 40 years, it was the perfect place and he got away with murder."" West Mercia Police constable Peter Sharrock, who was among the search teams, told the hearing how the septic tank was apparently overlooked during the initial searches. ""At the time, it just looked like a pad of concrete and I didn't pay it any attention,"" he said. ""The word is hindsight, really."" Mr Burrows had said it was ""beyond belief"" that Mrs Venables took her own life by climbing into the septic tank and ""somehow"" shifted the heavy lid and put it back in place above her ""so that there was no sign of any disturbance"". He also said it was ""preposterous to suppose"" Mrs Venables walked out of their house that night and was confronted by someone outside the house. Giving his evidence, Venables told how he regretted his affair. He also claimed he and his wife's relationship remained sexual and that they continued to share a bed until she vanished. But the court heard evidence from notes made by Mrs Venables' consultant psychiatrist, who she was seeing for treatment for depression in March 1982, saying the couple had not slept together since 1968 and had not shared a bed for three years. In police interviews, Venables even claimed murderer Fred West could have been responsible for killing his spouse. But jurors rejected his claims of innocence and convicted him of Mrs Venables' murder.  Following his conviction, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said few people knew about the ""very secluded"" septic tank in 1982, and only two people had emptied the tank, Mr Venables and another worker who said it had been difficult to access. As such, the CPS added, it was its case that if anybody else had been responsible for Mrs Venables' death, they would not have known about the tank as a way of concealing her body and it was ""unbelievable"" she may have been killed somewhere else and her body returned home. Her family have said her disappearance had ""devastated"" them.  ""She was kind and caring and has been greatly missed,"" they said.  ""We, her surviving family, are thankful that Brenda was found and that we were able to lay her to rest with her parents in a place of security, calm and dignity."" Marian Walters, who was a friend of Mr Venables' brother, said the trial puts an end to decades of angst. ""Nobody could imagine what it must have been like for the family, you know it can bring closure to all members of the family,"" she said. ""Until the news broke three years ago, you know it's been lying dormant really.  ""The family can hopefully - it won't be easy - but they can move on, they can move forward.""

London 2012: The legacy of the Olympics 10 years on,"The view, from the top of a condemned tower block in east London, was to die for. Lund Point, on the Carpenters Estate in Stratford, was our window to the spectacle of London 2012 - a superb vantage point overlooking the Olympic stadium. The tower was the hub of an ambitious BBC broadcasting operation. Some flats were still occupied by residents, others were converted into TV and radio studios, newsrooms, broadcast galleries, and even a canteen.  But it was about much more than sport. For several heady weeks this is where all the news came from, too. The BBC's flagship six and ten o'clock news programmes were broadcast from here - 57 live bulletins in all. And then, on Sunday 9 September 2012, the late BBC news wrapped up with a montage of the best Olympic moments, and it was over. For broadcasters, viewers and athletes, it was the conclusion of a glorious sporting summer. But for those who had lived here it signalled the imminent demolition of their homes - and the prospect of indefinite dislocation. But a decade later, it's as if time stopped. The tower still stands. The Carpenters Estate is a short walk from what's now called the London Stadium and the other venues created at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. This is the landscape reclaimed at a cost of billions of pounds, transforming its grimy industrial past into its current state of throbbing with construction activity. Housing, university blocks and a cultural quarter are taking shape. Yet the Carpenters Estate has been passed by. Its shoddiness is highlighted by the new steel and glass towers that surround it - but from which it is completely disconnected. Is that surprising? It's not as if some didn't predict it. In 2012, as the Games began, Warren Lubin lived on the 20th floor of Lund Point. During the Olympics he was interviewed by the Evening Standard. He told the paper: ""Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the Olympics and the thrill of bumping into the likes of George Alagiah, Huw Edwards, Riz Lateef in the lift on the way to my flat, but the reality is that in a few weeks the Games will be over and what we will be left with is a disgraceful situation of people being forced out of their homes."" A decade on, like the tower, Mr Lubin's home - a one-bedroom flat at the top of Lund Point - is unchanged. He is the only council tenant left. He's not alone in the building, but almost. In a block of 121 flats, fewer than 10 are occupied. The other residents are people renting privately from leaseholders who bought their homes.  ""Nothing has happened. Absolutely nothing at all. It's shocking and embarrassing. ""It's been strange. Weirdly, I am used to it now. I like the quiet. But there's been no upkeep and all these flats which could have been used are empty."" The estate and community were left in limbo when, in the mid-2000s, Newham council started moving tenants from this block and its high-rise siblings, Dennison Point and James Riley Point.  Together they were the landmarks framing the estate's identity and skyline. They were a little dilapidated, and in need of some tender loving care. But, say residents, there was nothing wrong at their heart. Solid concrete. Structurally sound. Soon nearly 400 flats had been emptied, the estate drained of almost half its population and the community hollowed out. It was a wrong, unlawful decanting process, claims Mr Lubin, because there were no firm plans to redevelop before it happened. He says if more tenants had known their rights, they, like him, would have stayed. Mr Lubin's theory is rejected by Sir Robin Wales, the former mayor of Newham, who set the process in motion, He said he was clear in his plan to knock down and completely redevelop the estate.  ""We were going to build thousands of new homes, both here and elsewhere in the borough. If you want housing, you have to develop. We had a plan.  ""Sometimes people don't want to listen."" It led to today's situation, where the buildings remain but people are few and far between. The lights have been kept on, the electricity and water remain connected, basic maintenance has been done, and since 2017 - after the Grenfell fire - wardens and security guards have been on duty round the clock in each block. ""It's costing the council huge amounts to keep them running even though there are only a few of us here,"" said Mr Lubin. Newham Council refused to tell the BBC just how much, but once you factor in the loss of rent and council tax, and the cost of housing the estate's former tenants elsewhere, the bill could be tens of millions of pounds. In the 23-storey Dennison Point, the 11th floor has several boarded-up flats, and one with a door and a protective metal grille. It is home to 79-year-old June Benn. She was one of the first tenants to move in when the estate was completed in the late 1960s and is one of only a dozen residents left in this block. She says many residents didn't want to leave but were forced out. But she is a leaseholder and she wouldn't budge. Ms Benn accepts it is a strange existence. ""The place has gone downhill. I used to know everyone. Now I don't see anyone. But why would I want to leave? I have told them I am comfortable here and am staying. ""My family don't like me being here because I am on my own and I am isolated but as far as I am concerned I will stay unless I am offered something suitable, which has to be near here. ""They made me an offer a few years ago to get me out but it wasn't enough to buy a garden shed."" There are two groups in this story about a community frozen in time: those who stayed and those who left. Among those who left were Pat Hamid and her husband Abdul who were decanted from Dennison Point in 2011, a few months before the Olympics. They had lived there for 29 years. Mrs Hamid said: ""There was nothing wrong with our flat. Big rooms, nice kitchen. I was on the fifth floor. But they told us they had plans to redo it all."" The couple were moved to a sheltered housing block on the other side of Stratford called Holden Point. The Hamids were unfamiliar with their new location.  ""I never knew anything about this end of Stratford. I had only known my area around the Carpenters,"" said Mrs Hamid. Although they did not want to leave Lund Point, they were reassured because it was guaranteed they could come back - a ""right to return"" when the estate was rebuilt. As it does, real life intervened. Mr Hamid became unwell.  By the time he died in 2020 they had given up any thoughts of returning, had settled in their sheltered block with wardens who could be summoned for help at the press of a buzzer. Mrs Hamid is shocked her old block has not been knocked down and no regeneration work has even begun. ""Of course it's good you've got council tenancies for people who need housing but at the end of the day they seem to think you are a commodity. They think 'if we want to do something we'll do it'. ""But they haven't done anything. That's the problem. Why were we moved? Older tenants like me won't go back now. Of course not."" She's heard the latest plans are for a redevelopment that could take at least 15 years to complete. ""In 15 years I will be older than 100. Maybe I can go back and haunt it."" Residents say this has been a terrible failure of legacy.  It is a story of protest and politics, suspicion and distrust. But most of all, inactivity. Aidan White, founder of the online newspaper Newham Voices, said: ""It's been a wasted decade. There's a huge sense of a loss of a community. They really do feel that loss."" The Carpenters became a tasty piece of real estate the moment the Olympics came into view. When the Games were awarded to London in 2005, land values started rising.  This site, perfectly situated just a short walk from the centre of Stratford, was of considerable interest to developers. There was to be a huge new shopping centre and the Stratford international rail station was being completed. Progress was heavy going, though, stalled by residents suspicious of the mayor's intentions who had fears of gentrification, being priced out and forced away. Or as Sir Robin puts it: ""That's what you get with the hard left, when the 'rent-a-Trots' get involved.  If you oppose development, you're opposing housing. ""I am careful to make a distinction here. I absolutely sympathise, I did absolutely sympathise with the people who didn't want to move. ""But against that I wanted to create thousands more homes and most importantly jobs too. There has to be a balance.""  In 2009, plans were drawn up by the estate's tenants group. It involved some demolition but retained the basic character of the estate. Those plans were rejected. In 2013, a proposal by University College London to create a new campus was withdrawn after noisy protests from tenants backed by some of its own students and lecturers. It is now building in the Olympic park itself. Two years later a group of single mothers occupied a low-rise block on the estate in a protest campaign highlighting the lack of affordable housing in east London.  Newham, one of London's poorest boroughs with more than 25,000 people on the housing waiting list, was getting a bad reputation. The object of growing hostility, Sir Robin threw the dice again, producing plans involving a joint venture with a developer or housing association.  He continues to defends his efforts. ""If I had still been there, we would have been building long ago. We would have had spades in the ground."" Then in 2018 events took an unexpected turn, the consequence of local Labour infighting, and the machinations of politics in Newham. After 16 years as mayor, Sir Robin was overthrown by a fellow Newham councillor, Rokhsana Fiaz, voted in by a huge influx to the local party of supporters of Jeremy Corbyn and the Momentum activist movement that backed him. She stood on a platform which included a new approach to housing, though Sir Robin said the Carpenters debacle did not have an impact. ""Not a jot,"" he says.  His successor said she opposed demolition of the Carpenters, and pledged more affordable homes and engagement to make it a ""community-led"" regeneration project. However, over the first four years of her mayoralty, progress was painfully slow as she tore up her predecessor's policies but struggled to come up with her own. Finally, last December a fresh masterplan for the estate was produced and put to a ballot.   It suggests tripling the number of homes to more than 2,000, with half at social rent levels and a large proportion of the rest for private sale.  As things stand now, two of the three tower blocks condemned by Sir Robin will survive. Of the 345 people who took part, 252 voted ""yes"" - a 73% share.  This process brought further controversy. Some raised questions, including the protest groups which also opposed Sir Robin's plans, and the Greens' Sian Berry, chair of the London Assembly's housing committee. ""It's hard to explain what happened,"" says Pauline Clarke, landlady of the Carpenters Arms pub which sits in the shadow of Lund Point.  ""Everyone I spoke to said they voted 'no'. You can't find people who wanted this."" The explanation may actually be simple. The tenants who moved from the estate years previously and still retained the right to return were also given a vote. And they had nothing to lose by voting in favour - and the possibility of returning to a refurbished estate In Stratford, although with no obligation to do so. For Ms Fiaz it heralded a breakthrough just before she sought re-election this month. At last, the first tentative steps had been made towards an Olympic housing legacy. She also took a swipe at her Labour predecessor: ""After years of false promises and the failures of the past, I am over the moon that residents on the Carpenters Estate, including those who have a right to return, have decisively voted to support this people-powered masterplan."" For Aidan White, of Newham Voices, it was the result of a ""fantastic amount of fatigue"". ""People just to want to move on. There's a feeling of resignation that this is now the only option. If the council is saying 'it's this way or no way', there's not much you can do about that."" For some it feels like the last resort. ""We are just desperate to see some life restored to the place,"" said Adeel Nauyeck.  ""It's been a joke. We've been completely ignored and the estate has been allowed to decline."" Mr Nauyeck, a former chef, has lived here for 30 years. In 2012 he moved, with his mother, wife and three boys, from a flat in Dennison Point into a four-bedroom house at the heart of the estate. An estate that he's watched crumbling bit by bit. He believes one of the reasons there's been so little progress is tension between the council tenants, like him, and the leaseholders who have different priorities.  ""When Stratford got the Games, suddenly there were leaflets coming through people's doors, telling them the value of their homes had gone up and how much they would get if they wanted to rent them out. A lot of leaseholders took the opportunity and rented them out and moved away. That led to this becoming a rental market with a regular turnover of tenants. ""The estate never settled. There was no longer a community."" His children went to the local primary school and are now at one of the new academies created on the Olympic Park. Their friends are in the area and Mr Nauyeck is determined to stay here. But for others, there is uncertainty and anguish they feel is undeserved. The bulldozers are coming after all. Dennison Point and most of the low-rise blocks and houses are to be demolished. Joan Hunnibale, 84, moved into her three-bedroom house back in 1969 and purchased it under right-to-buy in the 1980s. It is now due for demolition. She wants clarity about when it will happen. ""It's just been allowed to deteriorate here. You can run down a place for so long. In the end, people get fed up and agree to go,"" she said. Doreen Ward, 87, is far less stoic. She lives in a four-bedroom house with a garden she loves in a street she says is ""the nicest on the whole estate"". She is determined to live out her days in the home she has been in for more than half a century. ""People try and interest you in somewhere smaller and more suitable. But I tell them I don't want to do that when I've got 16 members of my family coming for Christmas dinner. ""I can walk to the shops from here. It's so convenient. I've got a sister in Billericay, and one who's ill in Herne Bay. I don't drive but it's so easy for me to get there by train."" She has objected to every proposal for the estate so far, and voted against this latest one. ""You get the feeling they want to make it so ugly and unliveable that eventually they get their own way and flatten it all,"" she said. Mr Lubin ""reluctantly"" voted in favour of the plans. He is not happy with the prospect of the amount of housing tripling. ""Something has to happen. If the vote was 'no' what would that mean? Would it mean another 10 years of doing nothing?"" Under Ms Fiaz, there is seemingly a more optimistic face to the impending upheaval. The estate's green spaces are being spruced up and the street railings painted. There is a community drop-in called The Dovetail, inside which is a model of the plans for the estate. There are yoga sessions, art classes and other activities. Updates on the plans and messages from the mayor are posted on a bright and cheerful website and in a regular newsletter. Will these plans survive the upcoming upheaval? The viability of building affordable housing tends to depend on how much cash can be raised from building homes for private sale on a development site.  That income subsidises the affordability, enabling more flats at social rent. The question is how the council makes the sums add up - and how long this drags out the regeneration. The local authority has set up its own housing company to deliver the project, which will be exposed to the same risks as any developer: economic downturn, rising inflation and interest rates, spiralling energy costs. Advice in council papers is clear that the initial pledges on timescale, design and the mix of tenure could change. Nothing is set in stone. Mr Lubin has just learned, via a newsletter, that refurbishment of Lund Point will not be completed until 2026. Work is due to start this autumn, with the refurbishment of James Riley Point. Over the past few years, the cost of renewing this one block has been steadily rising. It is now estimated at £35m. Another big impediment for the council is four families, leaseholders who still live in the block. They will need to be bought out - and moved out - before the renovation can start. For well over a decade, they have been the only occupants in a block of 130 flats. Some children have spent all their lives calling this home. Now they are feeling the pressure to move - with the progress of the whole redevelopment laid at their door. Negotiations are taking place to try to avert compulsory purchases, which would be even more costly and time consuming. There is now only one shop on the estate, next door to The Dovetail, the centre of community engagement. The proprietors do not know when to expect demolition, or whether they will be offered new premises. With footfall so greatly reduced, business has been poor over the past, lost decade.  But an unlikely saviour has emerged, clad in claret and blue: West Ham United fans. They stream through the estate on their way to matches at the London Stadium, which the club now leases, stopping for drinks and snacks.  It is an economic upside to weigh against the complaints of some residents that fans urinate in their gardens. The Carpenters Arms, as the pub closest to the stadium, is now very much a Hammers' local, packed out on match days. West Ham's prolonged run in the Europa League, reaching the semi-final, meant extra paydays - but landlady Pauline Clarke is another who has no idea how long she's got here. Hours before each match she and her staff erect fencing around the pub, and there is a heavy presence of security guards to prevent trouble with rival fans. The state of paralysis which has gripped the Carpenters Estate has made it a curiosity for academics. Masters dissertations are freely available to read, addressing various different themes.  Pupils from a nearby secondary school visit, filling out questionnaires on the streetscape and urban environment, as their teacher reminds them to be careful about the noise and to ""remember people live here"". Those people would of course rather be studied as an exemplar of what the Olympic Games can do to transform communities. But nearly a quarter of a century will have passed since those heady days of London 2012 - and all the promises of transforming the fortunes of people in east London - by the time regeneration work here is completed.  Jamie Jensen, a former member of the neighbourhood forum, said: ""If back in 2009 Newham had done what they now propose, rather than leaving the estate vacant for the past 10-plus years, hundreds of people could have spent the past decade living in decent homes.""  Sir Robin said he was ""in despair"" at the lack of housing.  ""We would have built. We had a great opportunity and the people who have paid the price are those who haven't got homes."" He won't criticise Ms Fiaz by name, but said: ""In the end, whoever is running the council has to take responsibility for this."" Mr Lubin believes hundreds of lives have been affected for the worse. ""This was a chance to come up with a model Olympic regeneration everyone could point to and be proud of. ""Instead, what have we got?"" At least the view, from the top of a previously condemned tower block in east London, is still to die for. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-62052032
Michael Sheen: I broke down hearing kids' care stories,"How would you feel if your child, or one you knew, was taken into care and ended up living in a B&B, a hostel, or even slept rough? What I'm talking about here is ""the care system"", the safety net we'd rely on if we couldn't look after our kids. I've been working on a BBC documentary which has found teenagers are still being placed in B&Bs and hostels - six years after the Welsh government said it wanted to ""eliminate"" it. Some of the stories have shocked me. With record numbers of children being taken into care in Wales and England, I've spoken to some young people who have been through the care system in an hour-long documentary, filmed over nearly three years, I've helped make for the BBC. My question is: does the care system always ""care"" for children who can't stay with mum or dad? ""I know for a fact prison would have been better than where I was placed,"" Niall told my BBC Wales Investigates 'Lifting the lid on the care system' documentary. He says he grew up moving in and out of care between the age of 14 and 18 - and after a place in a children's home broke down just as he turned 17, he was placed in a B&B. ""People moved there that had just come out of prison and stuff,"" Niall added. ""So I got robbed a couple of times in there. You'd see people kicking down doors on a daily basis, there'd be people smashing windows, people carrying knives."" Niall told me he was then moved into what he describes as a hostel, although his council insists it was supported housing as they tried to find him somewhere permanent to live. ""I was woken up by a punch basically,"" he recalled about one incident.  ""So I had to start barricading my door which, obviously, they got through eventually. It was like they put all the troubled teenagers under one roof."" The people in charge of Niall's care said they made every effort to find him somewhere else to stay and that his case was not straightforward, but Caerphilly council did not comment on the threats and violence. Hope was taken into care at 14 but ran away after her foster placement broke down when she was 16. ""I was a child in a tent with an adult who was over the age of 18, sleeping rough, where nobody knew where I was,"" Hope, now in her early 20s, told me. ""I was technically a child of the state. It wasn't OK... I was at risk."" Those responsible for Hope's care said it could not comment on individual cases but Wrexham council said its services had been transformed and it would use Hope's comments to improve things further. In 2016, I presented a petition to the Welsh government to end the practice of children being placed in B&Bs and hostels. Ministers said they wanted to ""eliminate"" it - but six years on, it's still happening. Research by the BBC Wales Investigates team suggests dozens of teenagers like Niall and Hope are still being put in that position.  Freedom of information requests to all councils in Wales showed at least 50 young people were placed in B&Bs, hostels and budget hotels in the past financial year, with at least 285 in other accommodation which is not regulated by the care watchdog. I don't want this to come across as an attack on social workers - because it's not. It is their job to look after these young people but they're working within a system that is, according to one report last year by those in charge of social services, facing a ""crisis"" to find suitable places for children to stay. While most children placed in such temporary accommodation are 16 or 17, our investigation found a small number are even younger. One example included an 11-year-old being housed in temporary accommodation with council staff, because there was nowhere else for them to go. Gemma - not her real name - felt she was let down by the system that was supposed to keep her safe. She says she was exploited by older men when she was young before eventually being taken into care at 14, when she had become addicted to heroin. ""I'd moved house 12 times by the time I was 15,"" she said. ""I've never fully unpacked anywhere. Nobody ever keeps me very long anyway."" When she was 16 she was offered a hostel to stay in by social workers, which she said had a drug dealer staying there. ""I'd just spent nine months getting clean,"" Gemma said.  ""They then placed me in this hostel where he was anyway. I was there less than a week before I was back on drugs."" After meeting Gemma and hearing all she'd been through, I broke down because what she had experienced and what she told me was just devastating. No child should have to live that life. My personal view is that we shouldn't tolerate that some young people just disappear and the worst possible things imaginable happen to them. Children who, from the beginning and often through no choice of their own, find themselves in circumstances that already makes things harder for them than it does for anyone else. People in social care tell you those are the children who are most likely to end up homeless, most likely to end up with mental health issues, with alcohol and drug dependency issues and even being sexually abused. The group that represents Wales' 22 local authorities said councils in Wales were ""committed to doing their best in responding to the growing demands and increasingly complex challenges in children's social care"". The Welsh Local Government Association said it regretted the standard of care and support it wanted to achieve has not been met in everyone's case, and that it was keen to learn from young people's experiences. It also believes there is a need for additional funding to help children and families earlier, and that wider societal issues such as access to health services and ending child poverty are not things children's social care can solve alone. When I challenged Wales' deputy minister for social services on her government's record, she told me that while the majority of children in the care system grow up in loving families, she accepts that a minority of children do not have the experiences she would want them to have. ""What we really want to do is put as much support as we possibly can to parents and children at an earlier age, and stop so many numbers coming into care,"" said Julie Morgan MS.  ""Crises do happen, placements break down, families break down... and the children have to be put somewhere... we don't accept that that should be the situation and we're trying to do things to stop that."" She added there were plans for new specialist accommodation for children with complex needs across Wales and the government was investing more in foster care and providing support for those leaving care. ""We have got it at the top of our agenda here in Wales... which doesn't mean that things don't go wrong,"" Ms Morgan added. ""To hear these tales from young people - and that I've heard so many times - that break your heart, you think how could this have happened? ""I absolutely accept that, but we're doing our utmost to make sure that every young person in Wales has, you know, a happy fulfilling life."" In England and Scotland, there has just been an independent review of the children's care system which called for earlier help for families too. Those in charge of social services departments there have long called for a ""system overhaul"" to address all sorts of issues  The UK government said it had already banned under-16s staying in places that aren't inspected by the watchdog and will respond with more detailed plans later this year. But for everything the politicians are putting forward, based on what you'll see if you watch my BBC documentary, I wonder if you would be happy for the current care system to look after your child if you weren't around. If not, then don't we all need to consider whether that safety net - and the people who work within it - is being treated with the priority it deserves? Because if we continue to let these people down and continue to get this wrong, surely the consequences don't bear thinking about. Don't we feel we owe it to them - and society as whole - to sort this out?

Terrence Higgins: A name that gave hope to those with HIV and Aids,"You may have heard the name and might know his legacy, but perhaps don't know who Terrence Higgins really was. He was a charismatic, fun-loving guy, loved by his group of close friends, yet it was only after his death that his name became known the world over. Few know of his unique ""wiggle legs"" dance, the astrology book he wrote and that his sexuality was behind his move to the city where he could be himself. Terry, as he was known, became famous for how he died, but he also lived. His name is now synonymous with the fight against HIV and Aids, because Terry was the first named person in the UK to die of an Aids-related illness. No-one had heard of the virus HIV when he passed away aged just 37 at London's St Thomas hospital on 4 July 1982 - and very few people had heard of him. But those close friends who knew him so well were determined to not only change that, but also change the way the world dealt with an illness few then knew much about. Superstars and royalty now regularly support the charity that immortalises a man whose death became the unfortunate catalyst for medical research and subsequent treatment that now ensures the illness that ended Terry's life is no longer considered a death sentence. Within 10 years of Terry's death, proceeds of two musical anthems - Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody and Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me by Elton John and George Michael - were donated to the Terrence Higgins Trust. It's gestures and support like this, alongside work to help people with HIV and promote good sexual health, that has helped the organisation that carries Terry's name become a world-leading HIV charity. The journey began just before the end of World War Two, in June 1945 in west Wales. Terrence Lionel Seymour Higgins was born at the old Priory Mount workhouse in the market town of Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, to Marjorie - Terry's dad wasn't on his birth certificate. It was in the town's dance halls as a teenager, that school friend Angela Preston remembers him. ""He would say to me and my friend 'come on girls, up you get', and he'd jive with two of us at the same time,"" she told BBC Sounds A Positive Life podcast, narrated by singer Sam Smith. ""He was brilliant. I can see him coming down the high street now and his trousers would be flapping. He had a dancer's walk. They have that airiness, that floating movement.  ""To me, he was just Terry who I danced with on a Saturday night. ""He had this air about him, he wasn't repressed, he got on with life and seemed to enjoy everything he did - and by heck he had a lovely smile. He was a lovely boy. ""It was only when he died that I found out that he was gay. I was quite shocked because I didn't have an inkling."" When Terry was growing up in the 1950s, gay sex between men was illegal and you could be sent to prison. These laws only began to change in 1967 - even then only partially. ""We'd play out in a field which was part of the council estate and occasionally Terry would come down,"" said Billy Yabsley, a neighbour who lived on Terry's street Priory Avenue. ""I was, say 10 and he was 14. He wasn't really a mixer. It was very rare that Terry came out. ""We were rough and ready kids, cricket one minute and football the next, then falling out and fighting - but Terry never got involved with any of that, he was a quiet boy. ""I used to go to market hall and they'd turn it into a dance room and I can remember him dancing, he was out of this world. We were like farmers in boots but when he danced, he was light like a ballerina and used to sway his body."" Terry also used to play the piano and Bill remembered ""he was a very talented boy"" who was a decent schoolboy athlete at the strict Haverfordwest Grammar Boys School, where he won the senior long-jump competition in the late 1950s. Terry started life in west Wales at a time when coming out as gay to friends or family could be considered a risky choice as attitudes towards homosexuality were different. ""I would have thought it would have been dreadfully difficult because there was such a stigma attached,"" Angela added. After finishing school in the early 60s, Terry left Haverfordwest to join the Royal Navy and lost contact with his old school friends - but not before donating his books and stationery to the school library.  ""We would often get visits from Terry when he was in the navy,"" said Terry's cousin Annie Oakley, who now lives in Australia. ""I thought he was so handsome because he had very dark hair and had creases in his trousers because of how they used to fold them over when they were in the navy.  ""My earliest memory was when he came to visit us and he was in the front garden, swinging us around... and letting us dance on his feet because he was always dancing."" As far as Annie knows Terry - an only child - never came out to his family, but he did not completely hide his life from them.  ""When I was about 14, I stayed at auntie Marj's and Terry was visiting and he had a friend,"" she recalled. ""It never occurred to me that he had sexual preferences and she said 'can you take this cup of tea up to Terry and his friend'.  ""I walked in the bedroom and there were these two males in bed, Terry and his friend, and I just said 'here's a cup of tea'. I was oblivious."" Terry returned to his home-town occasionally to see his mum before she died in 1974. ""He didn't talk about his family much,"" said Linda Payan, one of Terry's few close friends from his life in London to return to Haverfordwest with him. ""His mother was a female version of Terry, you could see they were mother and son. Great fun and she had similar humour to Terry.  ""She could be cutting and he could be quite rude to her, but she'd be rude back. They'd have that kind of relationship. It wasn't really close but they enjoyed each other's company."" Linda said she imagined Marjorie knew her son was gay because she once went back to Terry's childhood home with him and his then boyfriend - but ""nothing was said"". ""She'd have kept that silent, it was a different time and wasn't an accepted thing,"" added Linda. ""It was very taboo."" Terry had, by this time, made London his home where he'd enjoy dancing to disco music and felt free to live how he wanted - which could sometimes be like a wheeler-dealer. ""Terry was either with money or without money,"" added Linda, who first met Terry in a Wimpy fast-food restaurant after a night out in 1969. ""When he was without money, I'd see more of him because he'd have jewellery to sell. He'd say 'can you give me some money for them?' and it'd be a fiver or a tenner for all this silver. ""But he was very kind. Whenever he had any money, it was for everyone."" Terry worked for newspapers and wrote for Hansard, the official report of every parliamentary debate in the House of Commons - meaning he worked in the place that had made his sexuality a crime. ""He was a bit paranoid about being found out to be gay,"" recalled Linda. ""Once he said 'I've got some people from work coming over for dinner, could you pretend to be my wife?' So I did."" Terry, a Gemini, had an interest in astrology and wrote a book on the subject called The Living Zodiac and he loved socialising. ""I used to call him wiggle legs,"" added Linda. ""He had these wiggly legs when he danced and it always made me laugh... his legs never seemed to part but his knees were together. ""Life was so exciting for him, he was always looking for new adventures and was very funny.  ""I said to him 'you're either going to be very famous or end up on a park bench'. He laughed his head off on that one. But Terry did become famous."" It was in the gay clubs where Terry became friends with Rupert Whitaker and Martyn Butler - two men who would ensure the name Terrence Higgins would one day become famous around the globe. ""I liked him because he looked out and cared for people,"" said Martyn, who was 20 years younger than Terry. ""If you were misbehaving, he'd tell you off. He was a bit motherly like that."" Rupert was 18 when he started a relationship with Terry and was enamoured with his streetwise nature in a time where their community felt marginalised. ""He didn't care about anything, he was completely unselfconscious,"" said Rupert. ""He had a very healthy attitude of scepticism towards any pretentiousness. ""I thought he was just gorgeous. This was the era of the clones... very short cropped hair, big moustache, strong five o'clock shadow, plaid shirts, tight jeans and builder's boots. ""It was a hyper masculine look and I completely fell for it."" They all became a ""family"" in a community in London that already felt on the outside - and it was about to get even more tough. Both had HIV when they met, but neither were to know.  While no-one knew it yet, the wave of this epidemic was about to hit. Within 18 months of their first meeting at Bangs nightclub on London's Tottenham Court Road, Terry had died. ""He never really talked about it,"" Rupert recalled. ""It was like he was a very passive witness to his own deterioration."" In the spring of 1982, Terry's illness became much more serious and he collapsed in London's Heaven nightclub and was rushed to hospital. ""Only family could visit,"" said Rupert. ""I said 'he doesn't have any family, I'm his boyfriend' so the nurses were cool with that, but the physicians didn't talk to me. 'Gay cancer' ""At the time, a gay newspaper ran this report... about what was then gay cancer and pneumonia. We had an idea that this thing was in America but nobody had any idea it was in Europe.  ""I was pretty sure that's what Terry had. He'd gone downhill so quickly."" Rupert had been celebrating independence day with some American friends on 4 July 1982 when he popped in with some ""ice lollies, Lucozade and Tizer"" to see Terry. Those drinks remained undrunk. Terry died that evening. ""I knew very much that I had loved him - but I didn't know if he'd loved me,"" Rupert admitted. ""I had to ask a couple of his friends and they looked at me as though I was crazy because they said 'oh yeah, very, very much'. ""Just before he died, apparently he was calling out for me. It's a real regret that I was late. ""The impact that had on me for the rest of my life has been incredible - it changed my life. And hopefully I've done useful with it to help somebody else."" At the time, doctors were unsure how to diagnose or treat the new illness while there was fear within the community and wider public as to what this condition was. Within weeks of Terry's funeral, a group of pals who had nowhere to channel their grief and wanted to help fight this unknown illness formed a trust in Martyn's front room in Limehouse in East London. ""I had this sense that I'm expected to be dead already,"" recalled Rupert.  ""I am expected to die. I expect myself to do die. What do I do? Do I just sit around and wait for this to happen or do I actually do something with the time I've got."" Personalising the trust in Terry's memory, they thought that would give their cause greater impact. The Terrence Higgins Trust has since helped thousands and provided sexual health services like HIV testing, making it one of the world's oldest and leading HIV and Aids charities.

Addiction: The faces of people fighting to break free and those helping,"A teacher who found her daily tipple had turned into three bottles of wine is one of the increasing numbers of professionals seeking help for addiction. During the pandemic, rehab and recovery services said they saw an increase in white-collar workers turning to them for support. BBC News spoke to the people who have received treatment and those trying to break the cycle of addiction. ""I couldn't cope for a day without alcohol,"" says Sally Cusworth. ""The harder I found my job, the worse it got."" The 46-year-old former teacher from Leeds had always enjoyed a glass of wine or two but she noticed her social habit had become a daily distraction. ""The more I got promoted, the more pressure I was under regarding Ofsted. And it's that building-up of anxiety that I really struggled with,"" she said. ""I drank throughout my career, but I was trying to control and monitor it."" Ms Cusworth's alcoholism spiralled into self-destruction when she took sick leave in 2019.  She became physically dependent on alcohol, eventually being diagnosed with stage four fibrosis of the liver and near to death. The former secondary school head of department was caught up in a daily cycle of buying bottles of wine as she headed home from work, only to ""drink in isolation"". ""I was slowly committing suicide really. It's a slow suicide on the sofa."" Ms Cusworth was among the 3,500 people who accessed addiction charity Forward Leeds' service during the first year of the pandemic. Entering rehab in June 2020, she thought it was ""for down-and-outs, kind of like criminals"" but two years on and she is now working with charities to help others.  Photos of her past are a pertinent reminder that ""I don't have that choice to drink alcohol because that's where I will go back to"". Ruth Bradford, from Forward Leeds, said alongside alcohol, cannabis, cocaine and ketamine users were contributing to the ""substantial rise in individuals needing support"".  Meanwhile in Doncaster, staff at Aspire Drug & Alcohol Services said referrals to their centre in the city had increased by more than 200% over the past two years, with demand from white-collar workers ""going up"". Aspire chief executive Tim Young said: ""There's still high demand for our services despite people going back in the office after the pandemic. ""What we're seeing is people who wouldn't normally come to our service, so we're working with employers across all industries."" For former sales executive Neil Firbank, a sense of purpose, hope and acceptance are the underlying principles of recovery. Mr Firbank's recreational use of cannabis, MDMA and amphetamine developed into a heroin addiction after a conscious decision to try the opiate.  His urge for a 'hit' resulted in him ""turning up at my dealer's house, still wearing my suit"" straight from work. He eventually lost his job, home and family as his dependency on the drug spiralled out of control. The 46-year-old now supports others to get back on track at Aspire, where he was treated more than 20 years ago. Rehabilitation service UK Addiction Treatment (UKAT), which runs residential centres in England, said 65% of all admissions to its eight facilities last year were middle class users. Nuno Albuquerque, a senior treatment consultant at UKAT, said almost two thirds of the 3,507 people admitted for treatment in 2021 were professionals, ranging from teachers to managing directors and CEOs in industries such as finance and healthcare. In 2020, half of the 2,872 referrals were from white-collar professions, he said.  Forward Leeds and fellow addiction charity We Are With You painted similar pictures in Leeds and Lincoln.  Shaaron Jackson, from Guiseley, West Yorkshire, says she has been an alcoholic for ""most of my life"" with her addiction stemming from childhood trauma. The 54-year-old former actress says recognising the issue is the hardest step in getting help. ""I think it's because still, even now, we see it as a failing. We see it as a weakness and that's how it's still viewed by society. ""I think that's why this kind of misuse is going on behind closed doors. People are afraid to talk openly about it. ""In recovery, we have very honest conversations. But then, if you go out into the rest of society, it becomes difficult."" Ms Jackson was drinking ""two litre-bottles of vodka a day"" before the death of her mother and a suicide attempt sparked her wake-up call in 2020. Latest government figures show 275,896 adults were using drug and alcohol services between April 2020 and March 2021, compared to 270,705 the previous year. However, there was a drop in those entering treatment with 130,490 in the pandemic period of 2020-2021 down from 132,124 in 2019-2020. The view from the ground suggests the opposite. Mr Firbank said: ""On average 40 new people approach us each week for issues with both drugs and alcohol, more than double the numbers presenting pre-pandemic.""  The pandemic has also changed how people are able to access addiction support. Ruth Bradford from Forward Leeds said they had ""had to adapt."" ""We're being very much more flexible to the needs of the individuals who come to our service.  ""When they're on their lunch break we can have a telephone or a Zoom intervention with them, and we know that it's been as effective as having these face-to-face consultations. ""It's helped them to engage more with us and complete their treatment journeys.""   While the move to digital support services has encouraged user numbers, the stigma of people accessing support still exists, says Dan Hunt, a community engagement coordinator at the We Are With You charity. ""There's a lot of work still to be done around drug and alcohol and I think we've got to start treating it as a health condition. ""There's such a stigma attached to drug and alcohol services about a specific type of people accessing them, that people are afraid to come in or seek the help because they don't feel they belong to that same group of individuals."" Ms Jackson backed this view up saying: ""People view addiction [as though] it's somebody on the streets begging or they look dishevelled and they think, 'that's the face of addiction'. Actually it's not. ""Addiction doesn't discriminate, that's the thing. It's not just poor people who are living on the breadline, it goes right to the very top.""

'It's like Chernobyl now': Life in Kharkiv's ghost town,"Saltivka, in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, has been relentlessly bombarded by the Russians. Among the ruins, a few residents are trying to survive. When Russian shells began raining down on Saltivka in February, life in the neighbourhood's numbered apartment blocks became a lottery - one block hit, the next spared. Inside each building, the residents of each apartment survived by their own luck - one apartment turned to ash, the next untouched.  As the bombardment of Kharkiv went on - March, April, May, June - fewer and fewer buildings in Saltivka were spared. Now the neighbourhood is a ghost town. Everywhere you look, deathly black burn marks rise up from the windows where shells hit. There are multi-storey gashes in the sides of the buildings. There are neat circular holes in the roofs where shells punched through but didn't detonate. There are personal possessions strewn over the pathways between the buildings - ejected from the flats above with terrible force. And the shells are still falling. When they land they shake the ground and send a boom bouncing off the buildings and echoing across the empty green spaces and playgrounds. The different shells and rockets have distinctive sounds and leave distinctive pieces of shrapnel that locals have become adept at recognising. They include remnants of widely banned cluster munitions and unguided rockets. None of the weapons are precisely targeted, so nowhere in the neighbourhood is safe. When there is no shelling, Saltivka falls silent. ""Saltivka is like Chernobyl now,"" said Serhiy Khrystych, 44, as he washed his face with water from a plastic bottle, in building 80. ""Of course there was the radiation in Chernobyl, but it was not destroyed. We do not have the radiation but everything here is destroyed,"" he said. ""It is impossible to live."" Yet there are people living here, eking out an existence in buildings with no gas or water, in some places just one or two residents in a block of 60 or more flats. The electricity has been switched back on in some buildings in the past week, and a few people have returned from the metro stations or other shelters. But it is still a tiny fraction of Saltivka's pre-war population.  At its height, the neighbourhood - a Soviet era development for the city's industrial workers and their families - was home to somewhere between 500,000 and 800,000 people. It was full of family life. ""It was a beautiful area, there was a beautiful park and there was light in the park, and benches and a fountain,"" said Tamara Koneva, a 70-year-old pensioner living on the ground floor of a half-destroyed building. ""Now there is nothing left,"" she said.  Tamara's husband died in March, a month after the invasion. ""Because of the stress,"" she said. So she is mostly alone in their apartment, and nearly alone in the building. ""I miss him,"" she said. ""I don't even have the desire to go outside."" There is one other person in Tamara's part of the building - a 53-year-old car mechanic called Valeriy Ivanovych, who has lived here for 20 years. His flat has been spared, so far, save for small pieces of shrapnel that broke his windows and punctured his washing machine, kitchen cupboard and bedroom wall like bullets.  ""Barely anybody lives in this building anymore, there is only one couple, a man, a woman and me,"" Valeriy said. ""People sometimes come to collect belongings but they don't stay."" The flats on Tamara and Valeriy's side of the stairwell were relatively undamaged, but a shell hit the other side directly and the apartment opposite Valeriy's was only ash, collapsed concrete and charred possessions.  ""Maybe the building will have to be destroyed, because the second part of it is destroyed and the third part is very much destroyed,"" Valeriy said.  He has no work now and nowhere else to go. He shrugged. ""This is my home, I have lived here all my life,"" he said, staring out his kitchen window over the trees.  ""It will be a great sadness if all these houses are destroyed because I am very used to this place."" With no utilities available in their apartments, some of the residents still living in Saltivka have created makeshift outdoor kitchens where they cook food and sit together for company. Once a day, volunteers from the food charity World Central Kitchen make their way around the neighbourhood and hand out meals in styrofoam boxes.  ""Saltivka is a desert now,"" said Leon Petrosyan, a 50-year-old engineer who was carefully navigating a beaten-up black Volga around shell craters and debris, in order to hand out the food. ""The people who are left here have nowhere else to go,"" he said. ""They are trapped."" Leon stopped for a break and lit a cigarette. The food deliveries are a lifeline for the few residents in Saltivka. There are no shops open here now and for many it is the only meal they eat each day. Serhiy Zhuravliov, a 51-year-old, lifelong Saltivka resident who was helping deliver the food, said he had stayed in the neighbourhood throughout the invasion and the worst of fighting nearby, when Ukrainian troops were stationed in the residential buildings and the frontline was on the doorstep. ""At first we felt fear. Later, we got used to the sound of the shelling,"" he said. ""Now we can't go to sleep without it."" Looming over Leon and Serhiy as they smoked was a 16-storey tower gouged and burned by direct hits. Up on the 16th floor, Larisa Enina looked out carefully from her hallway on to the high open air, through a gap where part of the wall used to be. There were about 15 people left in the 143-apartment building, Larisa said. The apartment she shares with her husband and daughter was relatively undamaged, save for shrapnel holes in the windows. ""The apartment near ours burned down completely and ours remained intact,"" she said. ""It is a miracle."" But Larisa was worried about something else. There were big cracks in the walls on the 11th floor, she said, and she thought the building could collapse. ""It is a risk even to stand on the balcony now,"" she said. It's also a risk to stand below. The shell hits dislodge slabs of concrete the size of cars from the top floors that slam into the pavements below with terrifying force. If you look up from the ground, you can see slabs that have been loosened but not fallen, and they sit precariously above the remaining residents. Directly outside the entrance to one building, a massive slab had gone through four feet of pavement and earth and smashed a thick water pipe below. Roman Grynchenko, a 48-year-old car mechanic who has lived in Saltivka for 20 years, was stepping around the water-filled crater as he went in and out of the building. Roman eats one free meal a day now and, like most people here, gets by on government assistance - £55 per month for him, £55 for his wife, and £83 for their daughter.   ""I've been living here for 20 years,"" Roman said. ""Saltivka was a peaceful district ..."" A deafening crack cut him off - the first of three shells landing nearby. ""Now there is a war,"" he said. ""You hear explosions.""  The Russians attempted to seize Kharkiv in the early days of the invasion and Saltivka bore the brunt of the assault. The invaders were eventually pushed back, and the frontline now sits about 12 miles from the city centre. But Saltivka remains well within Russian artillery range, a reality made impossible to ignore by the daily shelling. At the edge of the neighbourhood, there are still trenches where the Ukrainians dug in for the defence of the city, and chewed curbstones where their tanks mounted the pavements. They used the residential buildings for rest and for sniper positions, residents said - turning the neighbourhood into a target. Few residents seemed to begrudge their presence. The soldiers went from building to building at the beginning asking those with children to evacuate, said Claudia Chubata, a 65-year-old resident of 33 years.  ""They are our soldiers,"" she said. ""They needed to do something here for the war and they needed somewhere to rest."" But Kharkiv is just 20 miles from the Russian border, a traditionally Russian-leaning, Russian-speaking city, and there are pockets of sympathy towards the invaders. ""Where there is no Ukrainian military, the Russians do not shoot,"" said Boris Rustenko, a 63-year-old glass miller, born in the Soviet Union, whose building was badly damaged and burned. ""If Russia had not attacked Ukraine, Ukraine would have attacked Russia, Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk,"" Boris said. ""It is very simple, Russia is just ahead."" Boris, like many residents of Saltivka, has relatives in Russia. In cities like Kharkiv, the Russian-backed violence that began in 2014 and the recent invasion have created smaller conflicts among family and friends.  ""This is Russia, we were brothers,"" said Oleksiy, a 69-year-old builder, who didn't want to give his last name. ""We don't understand why they invaded. We have relatives there, and now what?"" Russia alone was not to blame, Oleksiy thought. The West should ""stop giving Ukraine weapons"", he said, because it was only prolonging the war. As Oleksiy was talking, another resident standing next to him started to cry. ""We were so happy to have flats here,"" said Halyna, a 62-year-old pensioner. Her windows, directly above where she stood, were smashed. ""We were told to replace them ourselves,"" she said. The repairs would cost five times her monthly pension. Less than 10 miles away from where Halyna stood was the frontline. There are fears that Russian troops might return to Kharkiv. Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, said on Sunday that Russia was once again ""trying to make Kharkiv a frontline city"". Outside Halyna's building, a few neighbours from buildings nearby were coming up to collect their daily free meal from a bench. It was late afternoon. Halyna looked on, a tear still under her eye.  ""How many have been killed now?"" she said, shaking her head.  ""And just boys, 18 years old. They had only just begun to live."" Rita Burkovska contributed to this report.

Ukraine war: 'My kids cried every night asking if we're going to die',"It's having her children not crying every night and asking if they will be killed is why Kateryna Halenda knows it was the right call to flee Ukraine. Leaving a country torn apart by war may seem like an easy decision but husband Oleh had to persuade her to leave with their two young children because she didn't want to leave him behind. Kateryna now knows she and her kids are safe but still gets mobile phone alerts when air raids are happening back home. Her worries remain, hoping Oleh is ok. The 32-year-old teacher and her two sons Oleksander, nine, and four-year-old Artem are three of the more than five million refugees to have fled Ukraine while worried about the family they've left behind. But unlike many of the 60,000 Ukrainian refugees that have arrived in the UK since Russia invaded Ukraine, Kateryna and her boys have not been taken in by kind families wanting to help. They are one of 60 families who are in a unique Ukrainian community thousands of miles from their homeland in a specialist camp - offering a place to stay, food, education and advice - in the sanctuary of Wales. ""It's like a big family here. we're all looking out for each other,"" said Kateryna. ""We were amazed when we came here. It's very new but they're now completely happy, they're playing with other children every day and going to school every day. And they feel safe here - and that's important."" Kateryna is one of 222 Ukrainian refugees at the camp run the the Welsh youth organisation Urdd Gobaith Cymru and supported by the Welsh government where more than 100 children displaced from home can now play and learn safely. Yet while their parents and grandparents enjoy this haven from war, home and family is never far from their thoughts - and that explains why they didn't escape Ukraine sooner. ""We waited for 100 days because we didn't want to leave at first but my husband made us go,"" said Kateryna. ""It wasn't safe. We were just so often in our basement because of those air raid sirens all of the time, including at night when I had to wake up my kids. ""But we decided to leave just to find a safe place for my kids."" Kateryna didn't know Olena Andrshchuk before they arrived at the centre in Wales two weeks ago. But now the mums have become friends and support each other with their husbands still back in Ukraine. Olena's husband Pavlo also made his wife leave their home in the capital Kyiv for the safety of her and their two children. ""It's still not safe,"" said the 36-year-old website content writer. ""The very day we were leaving, very close to where we live I woke up in the middle of the night because of really big bombing. ""It still wasn't an easy decision to leave because I still had to leave my home town, my husband, everything I have - but I left for my kids."" Olena says she ""loves"" it in Wales and likens the centre to a ""holiday resort"" with lots of new friends with shared experiences - but the harsh reminders of what's happening at home aren't too far away. ""I have an app on my phone and I still get the alert for the sirens in Ukraine and they are quite frequent,"" said Kateryna, whose husband Oleh is a volunteer back in their home city of Ternopil in western Ukraine. ""So I know when to call my husband to ask how he is."" The Urdd centre normally hosts Welsh schools but its Ukrainian children who have been living, learning, and laughing in this small corner of the Welsh countryside for the last two months - enjoying the fact they're free to simply play and have fun safely again. ""My kids didn't attend school for up to three months because it wasn't safe,"" said Kateryna. ""But now they're happy as they go to school every day and feel safe."" Olena agreed as her youngest Leonard, aged four, struggled with a lack of social interaction with children of his own age because most were kept inside because people were ""too afraid"" to let them play outside with air raid sirens bellowing all around. ""It was a big problem for my little one back in Ukraine,"" she said. ""Now we've come here, the kids can socialise, communicate with each other and they're open to all kinds of activities, which they were missing for so long so they just they're happy. ""Of course they are missing their father and grandparents but this is the better reality than what we had in Ukraine."" While the children enjoy there are daily lessons - in English and Welsh - and a world of activities, their parents can concentrate on finding work, accessing benefits and figuring out where they go next. All of that expert help for refugee families is provided on-site in a one-stop shop that also offered health checks to everyone that arrived - much to the delight of grandmother Marta Burak. ""I was so happy because my grandson was tested for an illness here that we were not able to do back at home,"" said the 64-year-old retired teacher. ""Now he's on three months medication. That was very important for me."" While her daughter Khrystyna gets intensive English lessons provided by the local college, Marta, who is in her fifth week in the centre, is getting help and advice from on-site authorities to remain in the UK. ""While we are doing the necessary legal things to stay in the UK, we would love to stay here forever,"" she said. ""But one day, we'll have to move on."" Yet Marta says ""while half of her heart is in Wales, half is left in Ukraine"". ""My son, my daughter-in-law and my son-in law remain in Ukraine and my grandchildren miss their father every day. ""They cannot properly speak with him because they start crying but we are safe here, that is the most important thing. ""Yesterday I got such sad news because the only son of my friend's family got killed and he was only 30. He was such a handsome, positive young man and it is sad young people are still dying in this war and this must be stopped."" Home is never far people's thoughts but the support of locals draping Ukrainian flags in their windows gives the refugees hope. And in the camp car park there are a handful of cars with Ukrainian registration plates while one family had to drive through Russia in order to avoid fighting on the frontline before eventually finding their way to Wales. People in Wales have so far raised millions of pounds for the Ukraine humanitarian fund and Wales has housed more than 2,500 refugees, The Welsh government has directly sponsored nearly 3,000 people to come to Wales and most are yet to arrive but the scheme has been paused to allow people to move on from their 'welcome centres'.  Mark Drakeford wants Wales to be a ""nation of sanctuary"" and to help Ukrainian refugees ""re-establish their lives"". But Wales' first minister acknowledged the ""challenge for the coming weeks"" is to help more people leave the centre and into more permanent placements so more refugees can be housed and helped. ""Our focus has been on the arrival of people but now we have 4,000 people wanting to come to Wales when we originally expected 1,000,"" he said on a visit to the camp. ""We've got to focus on people moving on from our centres so there are long-term prospects for people who are here temporarily."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-61864374
How Sandwell is encouraging families to embrace exercise,"It once had the unenviable title of the most inactive area in England, but Sandwell is managing to make big leaps in improving the fitness and health of its residents. The BBC went to find out how.  ""They're always doing something, they're always on the go."" The doors open and the boys rush in. The nets are taut, the court floor freshly polished and water bottles line the wooden benches.  Emma Withey has brought her three sons Lewis, 16, Charlie, 12, and Jake, 10, to play badminton.   They've arrived at the Hadley Stadium in Smethwick early, champing at the bit to play with their friends from the Sandwell Special Olympics group. After lockdown ended, the Withey family stepped up their weekly physical exercise routine so they combine an hour on the courts with football, a swimming class and walking their dog.   It's the balance Emma, from Smethwick, has been striving for. Her boys have learning disabilities and she told me she has found it hard to find activities that excite them, hold their attention and keep them fit. ""It just burns all the crazy energy off the boys,"" she said. ""They love it and it's like a great big family here. It's just finding the time to fit it all in with tea and bedtime routines, it is quite hard."" The Witheys are among a growing number of families in Sandwell seeking out physical exercise and it's making a real difference to wider public health.  For the first time in years, the six towns that make up Sandwell no longer have the least active children in the Midlands. The area is finally shedding the tag of what some have called - rather unkindly - the Black Country's fat capital. A major study of physical activity by Sport England looked at how much exercise an adult gets each week. If it's more than 150 minutes, that's considered 'active' but if it's less than 30 it's considered an 'inactive' lifestyle. The bad news for the Black Country is that, taken as a whole, it remains the most inactive area in England - with 35 per cent of adults working out for less than half an hour a week.   But Sandwell has moved from being the most inactive local authority area in England to 14th in the space of a year. There is nothing sluggish about this improvement. ""Sandwell is one of those places where a sense of community is absolutely crucial,"" the area's director of public health told me. Lisa McNally says the local authority is working harder and offering more grants to grassroots sports organisations.   ""It's not about telling them what they should be doing,"" she adds.   The council has delivered funding grants to dozens of grassroots sports organisations from football, to dancing and tennis.   And with the Sandwell Aquatics centre being a focal point of the upcoming Commonwealth Games in Smethwick, the authority has pledged to continue to offer free swimming lessons for children in local pools. Ongoing access to sport must consider the cost of living for families, says Dr McNally. ""We have high levels of financial deprivation,"" she said. ""A lot of our residents struggle with money and that can be a big barrier towards accessing physical activity and sport."" The Albion Foundation invited me to see some of their sports coaching in schools. The charity's goal is to deliver 10m hours of sport in the next decade and ""make a difference to 100,000 lives"". At Eaton Valley Primary in West Bromwich, year three pupils were limbering up on one of the warmest days of the year. Katie Grainger and her team were leading a tennis session for one group while pupils with special educational needs were trying out the long jump.  Crucially, they've found that 91 per cent of children they coach during school hours are also joining their sessions after school and at weekends. ""Since Covid, the obesity levels have been quite high coming out of it so I think that has helped with the mindset shift as well,"" says Katie. ""I think it is really important to encourage not just physical activity but healthy lifestyles as a whole."" Volunteers are an important part of the shift in attitudes. Norma Hyde has been a volunteer for Sandwell Special Olympics for 40 years.   The organisation has just been awarded the Queen's Award for Voluntary Service.   Ms Hyde says the young adults missed sport and exercise during the pandemic and it increased their isolation. ""They've missed it for quite a long time and they began to become unfit and it also affected their mental health,"" she said.   ""A lot were getting so isolated and depressed, they needed something to belong to. We're trying to keep them active and keep the momentum going."" The devil, as they say, is in the detail but really it's in the data.  In Sandwell last year, NHS England reported a nine per cent drop in hospital admissions directly attributable to obesity.  Taken with the Sport England survey, it's understandable why there is a renewed confidence that families like the Witheys are engaging with sport. For a decade, I have reported on the difficulty families in the Black Country have faced to stay fit, eat healthily and access sport.   I have spoken to countless health experts, frustrated directors of public health who all had sensible plans but when fresh data emerged, it was clear progress was much harder to achieve. Dr McNally says the Commonwealth Games could ""stimulate a lot more interest in being active…which could bring such a boost to what we are trying to achieve here"".

Sudden unexplained death in childhood: 'Why did my beautiful son die?',"Louis Rogers was a healthy, energetic little boy. Last summer, his mother Julia put him to bed as usual. An hour later, she went to check on him. He had died, six weeks away from his second birthday, without crying out for help or making any sound at all. It was only later the London-based marketing professional was given a leaflet about sudden unexplained death in childhood (SUDC), a rare category of death in which the cause remains unknown even after thorough investigation, including a post-mortem examination. As with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), a condition more commonly known as cot death, many cases involve children dying while asleep. In contrast to SIDS, though, there have been no awareness campaigns. Here, in her own words, Julia, 41, talks about what happened to Louis, and her frustration over the lack of research being carried out into SUDC. He was just an absolute joy, the most affectionate little boy. He had a beautiful smile, his laugh was so funny.  He would go to the park and only go on the swing and not be interested in anything else. When we'd go to soft play, he would only go down the yellow slide, over and over again. He'd make the most of everything, even a puddle - he'd be like 'it's the best thing ever!' Louis was healthy, a really strong boy. His development was good. When he was 13 months old, he had his first seizure. We were down by the lock to see the boats when it happened. I just remember him making this little noise and his arms went up in the air.  I started screaming because he was shaking and he'd started foaming at the mouth. I thought he was dying. After a couple of minutes I'd thought he had because he went blue. The ambulance came really quickly. They took his temperature and he didn't have one so they took it really seriously. We went on blue lights to the hospital. He was really sleepy but was breathing. They all rushed in and hooked him up to monitors. They took his temperature again and that time he had one and they literally unplugged everything and left the room. I didn't know what was going on.  I realised later they had decided it was a febrile seizure and therefore it was absolutely nothing to worry about. The paediatrician came and was so casual about it, saying, ""There's nothing to worry about, lots of children get them.""  I was then told if he had another one I probably wouldn't need to call an ambulance but could do as he's young. I didn't think to ask what happens if he has one when he's asleep, and toddlers sleep more than half the day. They didn't mention it.  After that first seizure, I felt like it took something from him. When we picked my daughter up from school he would say ""bye"" to everyone, it was really cute, and after the seizure he stopped doing that, he never said bye again. He was picking up more words and they said not to worry but I did. I just knew something wasn't quite right. When he was 18 months old he had another seizure.  He was at nursery, I was at home. I ran straight there. They had called an ambulance and when we got to the hospital they couldn't have been less concerned. They said it's a febrile seizure again because he's got an ear infection. As soon as they decided it was one, it's as if they're trained to think it's not serious. There's no compassion, no kind of pathway for what happens next, and I didn't feel listened to. Then, when we got home, he had another one. The ambulance came over and the paramedic said because we'd seen a doctor already, we didn't have to take him in, because all they were going to do was see him and probably send us home again. Louis had been through a lot that day and was really tired so I agreed to let him rest at home. I found out later that if a child has two febrile seizures within 24 hours, it's called a complex seizure which should be referred to a paediatrician for an EEG.  They should have picked up on that. There's so little awareness about the risk; everyone is so casual and flippant. I don't think anyone is intentionally - no-one is ignoring it - it's just staggering, the lack of awareness. Source: NHS England / SUDC Charity/ Neurologist Dr Orrin Devinsky A couple of months later, he became uncoordinated and his right eye was a tiny bit lower. He fell down the front step; it was just a toddler fall, so we carried on and went swimming. I didn't think at the time it could have been connected to his seizures. At the end of that week, the nursery phoned and said it was almost like he was having lots of mini-seizures, like his eyes were flitting. I took him to the GP that afternoon and I gave them the whole history, so the doctor could also have picked up on him having two in 24 hours.  The doctor asked if I could walk Louis across the room so I did and he said, ""I can't see anything."" I remember saying to him, ""What should I do? Should I keep a diary of all these episodes?"" ""Oh yeah, if you want,"" he replied. Louis died the next month. I don't know if it's like this with other parents or people who've had a sudden loss, but you get stuck in that time and it's like torture. You just replay it. He had had a temperature that day so I kept him off nursery. He perked up in the afternoon and I thought he was getting better; he only had enterovirus which apparently is a really common, mild illness.  Louis had a bath and then I put him in his bed before going upstairs to read his sister a bedtime story. I was in the next room and had the baby video monitor on. I didn't hear anything, I didn't see anything. I felt like I had to check on him. I can't remember at what point but it just crept into my mind and that's what set the alarm bells off, because on the monitor I didn't see him move at all after I put him down.  I remember walking through and it was silent - with kids you can hear them breathing - but it was eerily silent. I called his name and stroked his hair but he didn't move and so I rolled him over and he'd already died. I don't know if he died immediately when he went to sleep or later. You think if your child's ill, you'll have a chance to go and help them because they'll be crying, or you'll hear them being sick - there'll be something where you can go and help them.  If you have been affected by the issues raised in this story, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line The hypothesis in Louis's post-mortem is he had a seizure and he didn't wake from the postictal (recovery) phase but because it doesn't mark the brain, they can't prove it. It goes down as SUDC.   I've since seen a webinar and it hurt me so much because they were saying there can be difficulties with breathing during the reset when you're on your front so they said 'just roll them over'. That's all I had to do.  After he passed away, a nurse gave me a leaflet for SUDC. I'd never heard of it.  I connected with the SUDC charity and began talking to other parents who had gone through the same thing. I then became horrified because many were talking about their children having febrile seizures.  It felt quite conspiratorial. People must know there's a link because there's all these other families. It's more than once a fortnight that this is happening but nobody is acknowledging it other than NHS Scotland who have put on their website that there's a potential link between febrile seizures and SUDC, but on NHS England there's nothing.  There's very little awareness, or a very mixed amount of awareness, in the medical community. He wasn't under anyone's wing, he didn't get referred to a paediatrician or have any follow-up; it was just lots of isolated events. I just feel like he was really let down. I felt like we were overanxious parents that go to the doctor and then you get dismissed. Throughout that whole time, nobody took me seriously.  Doctors should talk to parents, even if they don't have all the answers. They shouldn't infantilise parents, or try and protect them. I would have had a breathing monitor on the mattress if I'd known.  But there's nothing to make you aware. There's nothing to say there is a link between febrile seizures and SUDC - it's very rare but there may be a link. It hasn't been proved but then not enough research is taking place to make that connection. It's obvious though to any parent who loses their child with a history of febrile seizures.  That really hurts because it makes me feel like is this acceptable? Is my child's death acceptable because it's rare? What are the statistics that would make people pay more attention?  I don't understand. It's too many. Even one is too many. If it's something we don't know enough about then we should want to find out. That's the most difficult thing. I can accept sadly he's passed away, but I cannot accept nothing will change. I can't do that.  He was only six weeks away from his second birthday when he died. He lost his whole future. I miss him every single moment. It will never leave me and I never want it to. As told to Rebecca Cafe NHS Digital said it ""routinely reviewed the website in consultation with clinical experts to keep them in line with the most up-to-date evidence and guidelines"". It added any updates would be in line with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance and NHS England policy.  NICE said it did not have a specific guideline for febrile seizures and the link with SUDC but added its guidelines do say how urgently children aged under five who have seizures and a fever should be seen.   The Medical Research Council confirmed it had not funded any research that directly investigated a link between febrile seizures and SUDC but said it ""encourages the scientific community to come forward with their best ideas for funding"". The Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) said all trainees were taught about febrile seizures and that doctors were aware that rare complications could occur in any illness, however ""this is not something that was specifically taught normally in the context of febrile seizures"". Rob Stafford, chair of the Paediatric Emergency Medicine Professional Advisory Group, said the RCEM had not commissioned any research to prove a definitive link between febrile seizures and SUDC or produced a patient information leaflet which would specifically advise parents what to do should their child have a febrile seizure while sleeping. ""Resuscitation for seizures in children as described in the Advanced Paediatric Life Support guidelines is the accepted standard of care in the UK,"" Dr Stafford said. ""This would normally include talking and educating parents about what to do if they (children) are unwell or have a seizure, including when to return to hospital. It would be normal practice to give parents an information leaflet regarding febrile seizures at the time of discharge."" He said a commonly used leaflet could be found on the Healthier Together website. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-61177113
Operose Health: What I saw working undercover at a GP surgery,"For six weeks I worked undercover as a receptionist in a GP surgery owned by Operose Health, the UK's biggest GP chain. Most practices in England are privately owned by GP partners, but a rule-change in 2007 allowed bigger companies to buy up partner-led surgeries.  Operose Health has grown rapidly in recent years - it has spent millions buying GP practices. It now runs 70 surgeries with nearly 600,000 patients, making it the biggest GP provider to the NHS.  Across the UK, there is a shortage of GPs and general practice is under unprecedented pressure. Former Operose employees who spoke to Panorama - a dozen doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other staff - said they believed patient safety was being put at risk.  Our investigation found the company let less qualified staff see patients, rather than doctors, without adequate supervision. Operose denies profit is being prioritised ahead of patient care and says it has a clear process of supervision.  This is the diary of my time working in a busy Operose GP practice in London. Thursday 7 April - 'We run on locums' It's my second shift at the practice and already I'm dealing with a serious complaint. A patient came in and told me his GP had been absent and unreachable through his struggles with mental health. Last year, he had spoken to his GP but after this appointment he hadn't had any engagement from the practice.  He said he hadn't been able to get his new prescription, or to create a mental health plan with his GP. The patient said he felt completely abandoned.  The other receptionists are telling me this practice ""runs on locums"", meaning a lot of the GPs who work here are like freelancers - only working a shift here or there.  Monday 11 April - The 'cheaper' physician associates Today I met one of the less-qualified clinicians known as a physician associate (PA). I could only speak to her for a few minutes as she rushed to her next appointment, but she quickly opened up about how she felt she was being treated exactly like a GP.  She appeared stressed, telling me that from day one on the job she had been thrown in as if she had the experience of a GP, despite this being her first job out of training.   I hadn't heard of a PA before this. I asked my manager and they told me they were like GPs but couldn't prescribe. I asked why we wouldn't just have more doctors and my managers told me that each PA cost less than half that of a GP and were therefore cheaper. Watch Panorama's Undercover: Britain's Biggest GP Chain at 20:00 on BBC One on Monday 13 June Wednesday 20 April - The 'skim-reading' team   At the practice where I'm working, there is a team of people who process documents for about 30 Operose GP practices. While it's common in GP practices for non-medical staff to deal with reports, test results and hospital letters, this team doesn't have easy access to a doctor if they have questions. They have to decide on their own which documents should be filed away and which require action by a GP or pharmacist.  Staff in the central admin team say they're sometimes being told to process complex medical documents. They tell me they're concerned they'll make mistakes, but that management tell them to hit their targets.  They tell me they skim-read, even if they don't understand the information they are looking at. This team is the first point where these documents are read and, if something is missed, it could mean delaying or risking vital patient care.  Tuesday 26 April - Squeezing the GPs  I've managed to get a bit of time with one of the regular locum GPs at the practice. I ask about the PAs. He tells me PAs aren't the same as GPs and they actually need help and supervision.  The doctor tells me it's an issue at the practice and that he had asked for time out of his daily shifts to talk through cases and support the PAs' official supervisor, known as the clinical lead. He says this was refused by management in the interest of ""squeezing"" the most appointments for patients as possible.   Friday 29 April - The GP director is 'always here'  Today a patient came in and complained that he was never able to see his named GP, who was also the GP director. As I began to explain that this doctor doesn't come into the practice, that I had never seen him and that other staff had told me that he comes in rarely, I was swept away from the front desk.  One of the other receptionists told me never to tell patients that this doctor isn't at the practice or available to patients. I went to tell the practice manager of my ""mistake"". I was told that this doctor was ""always here"" - available by phone, despite not being physically present in the practice.   Tuesday 3 May - The day with no appointments  Today there wasn't a doctor or physician associate at the practice able to deal with patients with appointments. My co-workers and I panicked. We saw calls piling up - from 40 at 08:00, to dozens more soon after.  One of the receptionists yelled from the back asking why there weren't any doctors. My colleague next to me said it was a joke and we shouldn't be open.  Unusually, we were told we could book some patients in for the following day. But that had a knock-on effect. With the following day's appointments now already booked, it meant people calling from 08:00 the next morning, expecting to get an appointment, were also disappointed. We could only tell them try again the next day.  Friday 6 May - The end of a bad week  We didn't have a single day this week with more than two full-time doctors available for appointments for a practice with 20,000 patients. I noticed that the same patients were calling up every day, sometimes several times, becoming more desperate for any solution.  I once again had to tell them to try again at 08:00 the next day. All GP practices are under pressure, but NHS data shows that at my surgery there are about half the number of full-time equivalent doctors as there are at an average NHS surgery of this size.   Every morning we receptionists - as the first point of contact at the practice - had to endure hours of patients taking out their frustrations on us. Nothing could have prepared me for turning away patients. I believe much of it could have been solved if we just had a few more doctors.   Monday 9 May - Documents unseen, six months on  I was told by workers from the central admin team, who process medical documents for about 30 Operose surgeries, that there was a backlog of more than 1,000 documents needing doctors' attention. They tell me that the paperwork has been flagged for action on the computer system, but have yet to be seen by a doctor or pharmacist.  The documents are sent electronically to local practices, but the central team can still see which requests have not been actioned. I was told some of the correspondence had been waiting to be seen for six months. Staff told me these were important documents - including diagnoses, prescription changes and urgent information GPs needed to be aware of.   The admin team told me they were concerned for the safety of patients. They showed me an example, a request to change the medication for a patient. It hadn't been looked at for five months, meaning that the patient could have been on the wrong medication. Wednesday 11 May - Final day As I took the morning calls, I felt relieved it was my last time having to answer the phone to frustrated patients. But I felt I was also abandoning them, as I wanted to try my best to help them when I could.  After six weeks working undercover, I left the practice feeling that its patients were getting a raw deal. BBC Panorama approached Operose Health about the things I saw and was told while working undercover. In a written statement, the company denied profit was being prioritised ahead of patient care. At the practice where I worked it says it has increased the GP headcount to its highest level ever.  Operose said that on Tuesday 3 May - the day with no appointments - its clinical systems showed ""there were five GPs working that day"" at the practice, including one ""providing additional remote cover"". But when we asked if those doctors were available to book appointments with, the company didn't respond. Across all its practices, Operose says it has recruited 38 GPs in the past 12 months and is in the process of recruiting 14 more. Operose says its document workflow helps ensure clinicians receive accurate and well-coded documentation in a timely manner. And that the process is audited monthly for quality and safety.  Operose says it is the largest employer of salaried General Practitioners (GPs) in England and invests heavily in recruiting, training and rewarding GPs and other clinical and non-clinical staff.  At the practice where I worked, Operose says there is a clinical lead available to help answer physician associates' (PAs) questions - and that it has a clear process of supervision and invests heavily in PA training. Operose says it is not over-reliant on physician associates and its use of PAs is in line with the NHS long-term plan.  It says 97% of its practices are rated ""good"" or ""outstanding"" by the Care Quality Commission - and that it works ""in the best interests of patients, providing access to the highest quality of care"".

Ukraine's prosecutors wrestle with a new role: war crimes investigators,"It took Vadym Bobryntsev four days to bury his wife, he said. It was the middle of March in Mala Rohan, a village near Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, and the ground was frozen. The village was under occupation by the Russian army, so Vadym went out periodically from their shell-damaged house to dig in a far corner of the garden shaded by apricot and quince trees. After 45 years of marriage, 69-year-old Vadym, alone, lifted his wife Iryna into a makeshift casket, folded her hands over her chest, lowered her into the grave, covered the casket with a corrugated tin sheet, to protect her, and filled in her grave with earth. Two and a half months later, in early June, a local prosecutor from the city of Kharkiv drove out to Mala Rohan with a small team to dig Iryna up. First, the team walked around and through the remains of Vadym's house, interviewing him and taking pictures of the place where the shell had hit. After the inspection of the house, Vadym led the prosecutor along a path through the garden to the grave. The team took photographs, soil samples, and detailed notes, and watched attentively as two volunteers began to dig. Now the sun was beating down on Mala Rohan and the earth came loose easily. When the casket was raised up and ready to be opened, Vadym, holding a picture of his wife pressed between his palms, ducked under the branches of the apricot tree and walked toward the house so he would not see. The local prosecutor, Maksym Klymovets, was at Vadym's house to help determine whether the Bobryntsevs were the victims of a war crime - a specialist field in which Klymovets and his colleagues had no experience until Russia invaded Ukraine, three months ago. Klymovets, who has cropped dark hair and a neatly-trimmed beard, was accompanied by two forensic police officers, another officer who took notes, two civilian witnesses drawn from the village - in accordance with Ukrainian law - and two local volunteers to dig the grave. ""This is totally new work for us,"" Klymovets said. ""We are learning on the job."" After about three hours, Klymovets declared the evidence-gathering complete for this visit and Iryna's casket was loaded into the back of a van to be transported to the morgue. Her death would be recorded as an alleged war crime - one of nearly 16,000 such cases now open across the country, including more than 1,000 in the Kharkiv region.  There is no precedent for what is happening now in Ukraine - a large-scale war crimes investigation being conducted as the war is going on, by the nation under attack. In Kharkiv, ordinary local prosecutors have found themselves thrust into complex investigations for which they have little or no experience. In the field, they wear vests, some hand-painted, which say ""War Crimes Prosecutor"", though this job does not technically exist. They are working tirelessly to examine and catalogue scenes of shellings, missile strikes, and murders, and sometimes scenes of brutal crimes against their countrymen. The work is slow and methodical. Klymovets' team analysed the scene in Mala Rohan carefully, and they will return. Back in the city, in an apartment completely wrecked by a shell, another team measured and photographed every piece of damage, down to a small piece of glass embedded in a door. On the outskirts of a different village, yet another team went classroom to classroom in an agricultural college, tracing the path of a shell that had smashed through each dividing wall without exploding. As they go, the prosecutors narrate their observations in fine detail for the benefit of a video camera. They are following freshly-issued guidelines, and they work with the attentive diligence of people who are new to a task. The Ukrainians are being supported by some international expertise - explosives technicians from Slovakia; forensics experts from France; war crimes experts from the UK; a 42-member team from the International Criminal Court. But the sheer number of war crimes investigations now open means the vast majority are being carried out by Ukrainian teams. In Kharkiv, before the invasion, there were only 23 people qualified to investigate war crimes, so the region had no choice but to delegate the power to ordinary prosecutors. ""Everyone is involved to the maximum,"" Klymovets said. ""We are working seven days a week.""  But running war crimes investigations during a war presents significant difficulties. There are complex criteria which have to be determined to assess whether a war crime has been committed. The death of a civilian or destruction of a residential building alone is not proof. Were there Ukrainian military present at the site or nearby? Was the intention to strike a civilian target or was it a mistake? Was it definitely a Russian shell that fell on this building?  Obtaining accurate information about Ukrainian military movements can be difficult, because members of the public are often reluctant to say anything, even to prosecutors, about the locations of Ukrainian troops. The prosecutors try to check with the military, ""but we cannot guarantee they will tell us the truth,"" said Oleksandr Filchakov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office, ""because there is a war on after all."" Intentionality can be fiendishly difficult to prove, even with the best resources at your disposal. Satellite imagery can assist with determining where a rocket or artillery strike originated, but Ukrainian prosecutors have been unable to access it, because the priority is to use it for military purposes, because there is a war on.  So all strikes on residential buildings and those that resulted in the deaths of civilians are all being recorded as alleged war crimes, under Article 438 of the Ukrainian criminal code. ""To be a lawful strike it has to be on a military facility, military unit or some other military object,"" said Serhiy Shevtsov, a local prosecutor in the Kyivskyi district of Kharkiv, as he examined an apartment building in his district that had been hit by a shell. ""If it's a residential block, then it does not matter even if there were military in there until a few days before,"" he said, ""it is Article 438."" This is the prevailing view. But there is concern among some prosecutors and observers that the rush to investigate, while country is still at war, and to brand all these cases initially as war crimes, could undermine a broader future effort to hold Russia accountable.  ""It is absolutely fine to be talking about potential war crimes, but the moment you set things in stone you make it easier for the other side to discredit your work,"" said Philippe Sands, a UCL law professor who has served at the UN International Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights. ""If you get to a court of law and you can't prove what you said happened, you have only created new problems,"" he said. One regional prosecutor concerned with the process is Denys Masliy, the deputy head of the criminal supervisory department, who said he feared there was a resistance setting in to characterising strikes against apparent civilian targets as anything other than a war crime.  ""Any prosecutor, any judge in Ukraine, in this environment, who would examine the details of Russian actions and rule they were lawful, he would look like a betrayer,"" Masliy said, standing under the ruins of a block of flats in central Kharkiv. ""As a prosecutor, I must be honest, but this could be perceived as if I am not acting for Ukraine,"" he said. Masliy, a tall, good-humoured prosecutor with 24 years on the job, is something of a lone voice among his colleagues. ""No one wants to talk about this, it is not a popular topic of conversation,"" he said. ""But after this is all over, someone really impartial could take a deep look at all these cases and find problems. They will say we are fraudsters, our work is fake and we are the same as the Russians. The Russians will use it against us."" Part of the problem stems from a genuine grey area around what constitutes a war crime. A week before the invasion, the regional prosecutors took an online training course on the issue. Masliy posed a scenario to the trainers from the prosecutor general's office: if he took his personal rifle and fired from his window at a Russian tank, and in response the Russians flattened his building, would it be a war crime?  ""One of the trainers said, you have a right to shoot because they are invaders,"" said Masliy. ""The other guy said it could be considered a provocation, but he asked, is the danger from my rifle significant enough to justify blasting the whole block of flats? And they ended up having a quarrel with each other."" Three months on from the training session, that hypothetical scenario has become a grim reality. Russia has flattened blocks of flats - with less provocation than a rifle shot - and much worse. The liberated suburbs west of Kyiv revealed execution-style killings and reports of brutal sexual violence. The horrors of Mariupol are yet to be fully discovered. ""It looks clear that war crimes are being committed and it looks like they are widespread and systematic,"" said Sands, the UCL law professor.  The chances of justice ever being served for those crimes, at the higher levels of the Russian army and political system, are remote. The key task now, said Sands, was to gather evidence in the most rigorous way possible. And the key challenge facing Ukraine's newly-minted regional war crimes prosecutors, and its politicians, he said, was to show caution and restraint. ""It is very difficult to show restraint in a time of war, and the people investigating are doing tremendous work, but I would urge real cool-headedness in the characterisation of what is being found and how it is being publicised,"" he said. The shelling of Vadym Bobryntsev's house in Mala Rohan, and the death of his wife, was recorded as a war crime, but expert analysis will have to be brought to bear on the case - on small shell fragments from the scene, the likely trajectory of the projectile, on troop movements in the area - before the truth can be established. When that expertise is available is an unknown - there is a severe shortage against the vast number of cases. When the shell hit the house, the village was occupied by the Russians, raising a question over whether the Russian army would have been shelling its own positions, two weeks into its occupation. This was the prosecutor's initial conclusion - Russian on Russian shelling - but it is possible Klymovets could have to contemplate reclassifying the case under a different legal statute if the evidence suggests it was a Ukrainian shell. ""Of course, if we discover that this was done by our military, we will re-classify it,"" he said. To Vadym and Iryna Bobaryntsev's son, Pavlo, the important thing was to have ""an objective investigation, objective truth,"" he said. ""Truth must always prevail. This is a job that, although not very pleasant, helps to find the truth."" In some cases, for some relatives, the objective truth could mean a verdict that the strike that killed their innocent loved one was lawful, under the rules of war. Pavlo stood alone by his father's vegetable patch, after his mother's casket had been loaded into the van, holding the picture of her he had found among the ruins of the house. ""She gave life to me, helped me to solve many problems, treated me with understanding,"" he said. ""How could this not be a crime?"" Denys Zboroshenko contributed to this report.

"‘Abuse, assaults and big profits’ - children’s homes staff speak out","Children in care have reported being groomed and sexually assaulted in homes run by a firm making huge profits. Multiple employees of Calcot Services for Children say vulnerable young people were failed. BBC News has found it made profits of 36% last year, double that of other big care providers - figures already considered excessive by a watchdog. Calcot said profits were high because of built up investment, and it prioritises safeguarding children. The company runs eight homes, four schools and supported living accommodation in southern England. It made profits of 42% in 2020 and 36% in 2021, using an industry-standard measure. That is more than double the average annual profit made by the biggest 15 providers of children's services in Great Britain over the past five years - as highlighted in a recent report by the government's competition watchdog. The study found that profits of 17% were much higher than would be expected if the market was operating well. The sector is in ""crisis"" - says the providers' group, the Independent Children's Homes Association - with increasing demand for places, severe staff shortages and ballooning costs. But children's homes are the last resort for many young people, with the foster care system often judged as inappropriate for those who have suffered the worst abuse and neglect. And the time when homes were largely managed by local councils has long gone - more than 80% are now run by private companies. The BBC has seen leaked company records and confidential local authority briefings. It has also spoken to a dozen current and former Calcot employees. They told us the company had accepted high-risk children, who came with increased levels of funding, but did not meet all their needs and keep them safe. Our investigation found: The Children's Commissioner for England, Dame Rachel de Souza, told us she was ""appalled"" by our findings and said they revealed ""actual harm"". One former Calcot support worker we spoke to, Mia*, said it seemed to her that Calcot put profit before childcare and suffered from ""chronic"" under-staffing. She felt it was all about ""getting that high-level amount of funding for children with challenging behaviour"".   A letter sent to Ofsted by another member of staff echoes that claim. The whistleblower wrote: ""I don't believe they [the company] are acting in the best interest of any young people.""  Mia told us one girl's needs were so acute that the local authority agreed to provide extra funding so three members of staff could continually care for her in the daytime, known as a ""three-to-one"". Yet Mia says she was frequently the only staff member working with the girl. On another occasion, she said a colleague - who had also been working alone - was knocked unconscious by the teenager. Mia says the girl was later found with sharp knives in her bedroom. But one particular incident last year caused Mia to leave the company. She says a 17-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy were found undressed without supervision. According to Mia, the boy told other staff the girl had made him touch her genitals.  Mia says senior management assured her the incident had been reported to authorities - but Ofsted has told the BBC it wasn't. She says she then found that no record had been placed on Calcot's own incident log.  ""I knew I couldn't stay in a company where the standards were so low,"" she says. ""It was just failure after failure."" BBC News has learned of serious incidents involving other children of very high need and risk who were accepted into Calcot homes. One teenager - a victim of sexual exploitation - was even taken from a Calcot home by a support worker and given alcohol. Tina*, who was 16, had been subject to a Deprivation of Liberty order - a court-imposed restriction on her freedom. Such measures are normally used when children are sent to secure units. The teenager was meant to have been kept inside the Calcot home for her own welfare. Shortly afterwards, she went missing for a time. Another incident - the BBC has learned - concerns a school run by Calcot. Jodie* - who has significant learning difficulties and was judged to be at significant risk of absconding - had been given a place at the school. She was also living in a Calcot children's home.   She soon fled the home with a boy - a victim of sexual abuse - and later alleged that he had raped her. After returning, Jodie continued to attend the school despite the boy living in residential quarters in the same building.  She continued to abscond and twice attempted to take her own life. Once, she reached a motorway bridge nearly half a mile away. Another time, former teacher Mohamed Abdulmohamed found her climbing over the side of a river bridge. ""I ran, grabbed her and we fell to the ground,"" he says. ""There was a good five minutes where we sat there and she was just crying."" BBC News has learned that neither of Jodie's absconding incidents was reported to Ofsted despite Calcot being obliged to do so. Three former school staff members say concerns were raised about security at the school gates, but no improvements were made at this time. Calcot told us all incidents the company is made aware of are reported to the relevant bodies. It denied concerns had been raised about school security and said new electric gates were installed - although the BBC has established this occurred many months after Jodie's suicide attempts. Former staff at a Calcot-run school - Eton Dorney - have also questioned what thousands of pounds of specific local authority funding for pupils were spent on. They say some children, who had each been allocated up to £23,000 for one-to-one teaching, did not receive all the extra support. ""This is money from the public purse that's meant to improve the lives of some of the most vulnerable children in society,"" says Maggie McCarthy, a former teacher at the school. Two former members of Calcot's senior leadership team also told us that staff performing exceptionally challenging roles were both poorly qualified and paid. Our analysis of Calcot's accounts found it spent just 40% of its turnover on staffing costs. We found that the average spend by more than 30 other big providers was 58%. Calcot told us it has the required number of staff in its homes.  We have also learned that one teaching assistant at Eton Dorney was accused of assaulting autistic children on three occasions, and found to have turned up at an inset day smelling of alcohol. Another member of Calcot's staff was recently jailed for abusing his position and sexual activity with a child. The man - a former member of office staff at the company - had been redeployed as a support worker. The 28-year-old was sent to a supported living home for older teenagers and was often required to stay overnight. He groomed 17-year-old Michela* by sending her messages on social media calling her ""beautiful"" and saying he was longing for a ""cuddle"". Shortly after, he kissed her on the neck. After a few months, he had unprotected sex with Michela in the living room of the home while other young people were in their bedrooms. Afterwards, he went outside to smoke cannabis. Michela headed upstairs to her room and cried. If you have been affected by any of these issues in this story you can visit BBC Action Line. Within a month, she reported what had happened to another staff member and he was arrested. Michela found it hard to recover, especially as she was not immediately moved out of the home. In messages sent to a friend at the time, she described being left feeling ""manipulated"" and ""broken"". She started self-harming and attempted to take her life. Her abuser was jailed. When asked by the BBC on the steps of the court, the former office worker said he didn't know why he had been allowed such responsibility at the Calcot home. An allegation of rape in a Calcot home has also been made by a female support worker. She says she was attacked by a contractor while working a day shift in a property she claims was understaffed. Despite these incidents and staff concerns, which all took place in the past three years, Calcot has maintained a proud record with Ofsted - all of its children's homes and schools are rated outstanding or good by the regulator. Many of the safeguarding issues had been reported to Ofsted, including Tina being removed from her home and given alcohol - and the rape allegation made by Jodie. We asked Ofsted why these incidents had such little impact on Calcot's ratings. It said a number of inspections and visits to Calcot homes were currently being made. The BBC has also learnt that two homes in Doncaster, run by a different company, maintained their good Ofsted ratings until their closure was announced - despite more than 100 reports of concern having been made since 2018 to the local council and regulator. Police are now investigating allegations of abuse at the homes operated by the Hesley Group, which says it is co-operating fully with the authorities. Do you have more information about this story?

Dame Rachel de Souza said the sector as a whole included some ""exceptional"" private children's homes, but unfortunately ""some of the worst providers"" were also harboured by the industry.  She said it seemed wrong that some providers were ""still allowed to make large profits"". ""The entire system needs radical reform."" In all, the BBC looked at the accounts of the 32 biggest private providers of children's homes and residential special schools in England. Calcot - the 20th-largest provider - told us its recent annual profits appeared high because it had been unable to spend money on investment during the pandemic.  Although the BBC has learned that in 2019, before Covid, the company made a 32% profit - using the same industry-standard EBITDA measure of profitability. In a statement, Calcot Services for Children said:  ""The sector is rightly subject to stringent regulation and the company prioritises safeguarding all children in its care. It has a history of more than 30 years caring for and educating vulnerable and challenging children.  ""It is known for achieving positive outcomes and is highly regarded by Ofsted and the local authorities with which it works."" Calcot added that it was grateful to the BBC ""for highlighting what it considers to be safeguarding issues"". A recent review of England's council-run children's services suggested that the government should levy a windfall tax on the 15 largest private providers. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""We expect all children's homes to provide the right support, care and protection for children who live there - no private company should exploit those in need."" It added that it was taking steps to tackle poor-quality provision and root out bad practice. *Name has been changed ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61709572

Pope and archbishop on historic peace mission to South Sudan,"There has never been a visit like it and it has been years in the planning. A Pope and an Archbishop of Canterbury make a foreign trip together for the first time in history, joined by the most senior figure in the Church of Scotland. ""This will be a historic visit. After centuries of division, leaders of three different parts of the Church are coming together in an unprecedented way,"" says the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. Their mission is to bring hope and to encourage leaders to find a lasting peace in South Sudan ""We pray that this visit will be a catalyst for the leaders of South Sudan to focus on what unites them and not what divides them for they are all loved equally in the eyes of the Lord,"" says Rev Iain Greenshields, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. But this trip comes at a time when the country is suffering severe political instability, its people facing crushing poverty, and many observers are viewing the outlook as bleak.  The youngest nation of the world has been ravaged by a bloody civil war since its leaders disagreed over control of the oil-rich country in 2013, just two years after its independence from Sudan. More than 400,000 people are thought to have died as a result of the conflict and though a peace deal in 2018 created a unity government, some of its key provisions have not been implemented. More than 60% of the population of South Sudan is estimated to be Christian, mainly belonging to Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian traditions, though the war has been fought along ethnic and not religious lines. The battle for control mainly raged between the supporters of President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, and supporters of the First Vice-President Riek Machar, a Nuer.  Despite the deal, and the fact that they are working together, relations between the two men remain strained and there appears to be a lack of trust. Violence continues in parts of the country driven by ethnic tensions as well as a splinter group from Mr Machar's party - at least 20 people were killed during a cattle raid on the eve of the religious leaders' visit. In 2019, in one of the most dramatic moments of his papacy, Pope Francis kissed the feet of the leaders at the end of a retreat at the Vatican, at a time when it looked like the fragile peace agreement was about to collapse. It was then that a commitment was made for the three Christian leaders to visit South Sudan. The pandemic, security and the Pope's ill health have prevented the trip taking place until now, but there is considerable anticipation in South Sudan at what is a sensitive time. ""After the 2019 retreat, our political leaders made a pledge that they will never take the country back to war,"" says Father James Oyet Latansio, general-secretary of the South Sudan Council of Churches. Fr Oyet referred to the visit as an ""ecumenical pilgrimage of peace"" and feels the three religious leaders are uniquely placed to influence South Sudan's politicians, most of whom are church-going Christians: Mr Kiir, a Catholic and Mr Machar, Presbyterian. ""It will be a strong voice, a moral voice calling on the leaders of South Sudan telling them: 'Please now, give the people of South Sudan the peace they deserve,'"" Fr Oyet says. In an ugly, bloody battle for control of resources that morality has often been devastatingly absent. ""We are a majority Christian country, but what we are practising is not in keeping with Christian values,"" says Father John Gbemboyo Mbikoyezu of the Sudan and South Sudan Catholic Bishops' Conference. ""The conflict has brought so many brutal experiences to the people, it affects the spiritual life of the people and battles their hope and their trust in God,"" he says. Fr Gbemboyo says he is looking for a message of peace from the three visiting religious leaders but he, like Fr Oyet, also wants the Pope to directly tell South Sudan's leaders to focus on implementing peace for the sake of the country's people. With the capital's notoriously pot-holed roads fixed and the way that Juba has been spruced up, there is no doubt about the significance the leaders attach to this visit. It is intended that there will be joyful, celebratory moments through the trip. The BBC has been told 300 choir members and 70 altar dancers have been rehearsing for months. During the papal Mass in Juba, choir master Angelo Filberto Mussa says they will perform songs composed by South Sudanese. ""I am so happy the Pope is visiting us since we have been having a lot of issues. His coming will actually change a lot,"" says Deborah Yar Juma, a member of the congregation of the Anglican Church of South Sudan and a student at the University of Juba. ""When someone like the Pope comes and talks about peace, there is a hope that they [South Sudan's political leaders] will implement it."" But there has also, for many years, been frustration in South Sudan directed at global churches that had been keen to support the creation of the state, but once that had been achieved, did not follow through with adequate support in helping build civil society and political institutions. Frustration too in some quarters, that South Sudan's church leaders have not been strong enough advocates for peaceful co-existence among all South Sudanese. ""Churches both locally and globally failed in their moral responsibility to infuse doses of morality into political life in South Sudan,"" says Lino Nyaro Ungom, a former high school teacher and community activist in Juba. ""Moral decadence led to rampant corruption and conflict that led to loss of innocent lives and displacement of millions,"" Mr Nyaro says. ""If the churches had a strong voice, they would have challenged the politicians who are faithful in their churches and violence could have been prevented."" The Pope, Archbishop and Moderator suggest it is precisely that voice that they want to raise in South Sudan now, and that they will not hesitate in speaking frankly to South Sudan's political leaders. But in a country where poverty and food insecurity is rife, flooding has caused so much devastation, aid has been cut from some of the very countries, including the UK, that supported its creation, and where ethnic disputes have deepened, there are many obstacles to lasting progress.

Ismail Mashal: Taliban arrests Afghan professor who backed girls' education,"A university professor in Afghanistan who is an outspoken critic of the Taliban's ban on education for women and girls has been arrested in Kabul. Prof Ismail Mashal was detained on Thursday while handing out free books. He rose to prominence after he tore up his academic records live on television in protest against the Taliban's ban on university and secondary school education for women and girls. Prof Mashal, 37, has been accused of ""provocative actions"" by the Taliban. He is accused of trying to harm the Taliban's government by inviting journalists to crowd on a main road and create ""chaos"", Abdul Haq Hammad, a Taliban official from the Ministry of Information and Culture wrote on Twitter. Eyewitnesses reported that the professor was slapped, punched and kicked by Taliban security forces during the arrest, however Abdul Haq Hammad said the professor was being treated well while in custody. A former journalist, Prof Mashal ran a private university in Kabul which had 450 female students studying journalism, engineering, economics and computer science - all courses the Taliban's education minister said should not be taught to women because they are against Islam and Afghan culture.  When the Taliban announced in December that female university students would no longer be allowed back to study until further notice, Prof Mashal closed his school completely, saying ""education is either offered to all, or no one"". A defiant man, he has promised not to stay silent on the matter, even if it costs him his life. Video of the moment he tore up his own academic records on live television went viral. Since then, he has received many threats. But despite this, he's appeared on local media almost every day, as well as giving out free books from a cart to anyone who dares to take one. ""The only power I have is my pen, even if they kill me, even if they tear me to pieces, I won't stay silent now,"" Prof Mashal told the BBC's Yalda Hakim last month. He also said that more men must rise up to protest the restrictions against women. During their meeting in Kabul, the father of two told our correspondent that he was not afraid of being arrested or killed in his struggle to have schools and universities reopened for Afghan women and girls. He said he was certain that eventually the Taliban would try to silence him - but remained adamant that it was a price worth paying. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64509867
Nigeria election 2023 in Rivers state: The oil giant with no electricity,"There is a rhythm to the frenzy in this tailoring shop in the heartland of Nigeria's oil zone. The whirring of four electric sewing machines, snips from two industrial-sized scissors and the sizzle of moist fabric as steam billows from a large pressing iron. But another sound jars as the six sweaty men work: the metallic grind of a generator. It is behind a wall to muzzle its noise, but that cannot hide its high pitch or the smoky fumes it exudes. ""I have two of those, just in case one fails,"" says Ozu Adah, a lean-muscled man with cropped hair who runs this shop in Choba, a university community in the southern state of Rivers. Like millions of other small business owners in Nigeria, the 37-year-old tailor cannot rely on electricity from the national grid as blackouts are common and the 5,000 megawatts distributed is only enough to serve around five million average households in urban areas. Most of Nigeria's 210 million people must provide their own electricity - Africa's largest economy is run on a variety of Chinese- and Lebanese-made generators ""Since I was born, I have never experienced stable power supply. We call ourselves the giant of Africa but we can't fix electricity,"" complains Mr Adah as he works on a buttonhole.  Despite being blessed with large oil and gas reserves and hydro and solar resources, successive governments since independence in 1960 have failed to achieve a stable electricity supply. With just weeks to the next presidential election, all three front-runners - Bola Tinubu of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Peter Obi of the Labour Party - have listed fixing the power supply as a key point in their manifestoes. Though the campaign promises can sound hollow given outgoing President Muhammadu Buhari failed to deliver during his eight years in office on providing at least 20,000 more megawatts. Mr Adah's operations rely on electricity and he spends 3,000 naira ($6; £5) every day to fuel his generator. But since November, there has been a widespread shortage of fuel in Nigeria, which has worsened recently, forcing many to sleep overnight in queues at petrol stations. He is frustrated that he lives in an oil-rich state with so little to offer its citizens. As a boy he dreamed of working in the oil industry - as his father had done. But by the time he finished studying geology at the University of Port Harcourt, he was unable to find a job in that sector. Instead, he turned to what he saw his mother do - making clothes. She used the popular but labour-intensive manual Butterfly machines imported from China. Like a generation of young people forced to turn to jobs they would rather not do - he found an innovative way of pursuing it, using modern electric-powered machines. They are three times more efficient - but need electricity.  Those in the electricity sector complain that the business environment does not encourage expansion as they are unable to make profits, let alone break even. Nigeria has 200 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves - the largest in Africa and ninth in the world - and 25 out of 28 electricity-generating firms (a mix of public and private ownership) are powered by gas. But investors say low tariffs - set and regulated by the government - discourage investment. ""Nobody will invest in what is clearly a loss-making venture,"" said Olumuyiwa Abiodun, CEO of private electricity supplier Eden Power. Many electricity customers, such as Mr Adah's tailoring shop and thousands of households in Choba, are unmetered, and have to pay an estimated bill that is usually at variance with what they consume. Mr Adah's monthly electricity bill is 8,000 naira ($17; £14) for the compound in which he has his business, a house with at least eight rooms and two flats. Many Nigerians do not even pay for electricity. ""Many communities here don't want to pay for electricity as they feel the gas belongs to them,"" said John Onyi, a Port Harcourt-based electricity consultant. Mr Adah, like many younger people in urban parts of Nigeria, is rooting for Mr Obi, who hails from south-eastern Nigeria. He believes the 61-year-old politician is serious about fixing the power sector, pointing out that the Labour Party candidate visited Egypt last year to study that country's electricity supply system. ""He is not yet president and he has travelled to learn how to fix the problem, it clearly shows how committed he is to solving it,"" he says. Like most residents in Choba, he has voted for only the PDP in the past but his intended switch this time to the Labour Party is reflective of how Rivers state has emerged as a key battleground in this presidential election. Its 3.5 million registered voters are the fourth highest in Nigeria's 36 states, yet their loyalty is being tested with the APC and Labour Party seemingly making sizeable inroads that could split the vote. Rivers state reveals some of the internal battles the PDP is facing. Outgoing Governor Nyesom Wike tried and failed to win the PDP's presidential ticket - supported by four other powerful PDP governors - and is now suspected to be backing Mr Tinubu, the APC candidate. A larger-than-life politician who travels with his own band, Mr Wike continues to support the PDP at the state level and is backing the PDP candidate for governor. Many in Rivers state also seem to be wearing this dual cap - wanting to vote for one party at the state level and perhaps another in the presidential election. This was on show when thousands turned up for the PDP rally across the Choba River at Rumuji, an oil-producing village near Bayelsa state. To witness a rally in a small village, far away from the city centre, is to be treated to what Nigerians call ""party structure"" - the well-oiled campaign machinery that many believe is only available to the APC and PDP countrywide. Under the sun, women, men and youths, most hired by local politicians, gathered. Today they are here for the PDP, tomorrow it may be for another campaigner. One woman in a blonde wig ushered a dozen disinterested teenagers from a canopy into the sun. Their banner said: ""Golden Babes of Egbeda"". They jostled for space around a podium that included Joseph Yobo, a former Nigerian international footballer, and musician Harrysong.  The noise was as chaotic as the spectacle - an array of colours turned sepia from the fine dust raised by the thousands of legs trampling the earth.  There was a group blowing dozens of vuvuzelas, the latest addition to Nigeria's campaign rallies. But this was more than a jamboree for local government, it was the governor's show of force on a national stage. He wanted to show the main contenders his influence before he officially says which presidential candidate he will back. ""They can't win the election without Rivers state, let them try it,"" said Mr Wike to a rapturous cheer when he took to the stage.  His personal band played during an interlude - a song about him being a big man, to which he swayed. Outside the rally ground a tailor sewed a wax-print garment, seemingly oblivious to the chaos across her.  On loud speakers, the governor made a promise to electrify parts of the community still without power. But it did not matter to her - she was using a brown manual Butterfly sewing machine.

"Nigeria elections 2023: The allegations against Atiku, Obi and Tinubu","Nigerians voting for a new president next month will have 18 contenders to choose from but the three men seen as the leading candidates have been separately accused of trading in narcotics, money laundering and global tax avoidance.  None of them has ever been convicted, which would rule them out from running for office, but the high-profile allegations have raised questions over their candidacy.  ""It is choosing between bad candidates,"" said Auwal Rafsanjani, head of the Nigerian branch of anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International, pointing out how widespread corruption has caused devastating levels of underdevelopment and poverty in the oil-rich nation. The three top contenders are Bola Tinubu from the governing All Progressives Congress, Atiku Abubakar from the People's Democratic Party and Peter Obi from the Labour Party. All three say they made their fortunes legitimately and deny any wrongdoing. Mr Tinubu, who served two terms as governor of Nigeria's richest state Lagos, is probably the most talked-about candidate on the ballot. There are endless debates about his age, name, health status, work profile and the authenticity of his university certificate, but it is for the source of his wealth over which he has faced the most scrutiny. Many believe that Mr Tinubu, 70, is one of Nigeria's wealthiest politicians, though there are no official records. The most visible extent of his wealth is a mansion that sits in a sprawling compound in the Ikoyi area of Lagos - an upmarket part of Nigeria's commercial hub. It was here on election day in 2019 that onlookers witnessed the rare sight of two armoured vehicles, similar to bullion vans used by banks to transport cash, driving through his gates. His aides denied the subsequent accusations that he was involved in vote-buying. But questions about his wealth have been raised. In December, he told the BBC that he inherited some real estate which he then invested, but in the past he also said he became an ""instant millionaire"" while working as an auditor at Deloitte and Touche.   He said he had saved $1.8m (£1.5m) from his wages and other allowances, nearly the same amount found in accounts linked to him in a 1993 dispute with the US authorities. In documents that are publicly available, the US Department of Justice alleged that from early 1988, accounts opened in the name of Bola Tinubu held the proceeds of sales of white heroin, a banned substance.  Kevin Moss, the special agent that investigated the operation, alleged that Mr Tinubu worked for their prime suspect Adegoboyega Akande.  The agent said Mr Tinubu initially admitted to him on the phone that he knew Mr Akande, but later recanted and said he had had no financial transactions with him. While the court confirmed it had cause to believe the money in the bank accounts were the proceeds of drug trafficking, Mr Tinubu and the others denied the allegations, and the court never made a final order about the money's origins. Instead, Mr Tinubu, who was not personally charged over the money, reached a compromise settlement with the authorities and forfeited $460,000. Mr Tinubu has always denied any links to the drugs trade and his spokesman, Festus Keyamo, said the forfeited funds were part of a civil forfeiture and not a criminal one. Last year, he also reached an out-of-court settlement with accountant Oladapo Apara, who had fallen out with Mr Tinubu. Mr Apara was a founder of Alpha Beta Consulting, established when Mr Tinubu was governor and given the lucrative contract to track taxes in Lagos state, which it still holds. The accountant alleged Mr Tinubu had a 70% controlling interest in the company through proxies - and the firm received about a 10% commission on revenues collected, which he estimated to be $3.48bn between 2002 and 2018. Mr Tinubu denies this, saying he does not receive commissions on taxes received by the Lagos State government. Mr Apara said he was kicked out of the firm in 2010 after he alleged that some funds had been misappropriated - and began a long legal battle to seek redress. He argued he could not be sacked as a founder of the firm and demanded compensation from Mr Tinubu, which resulted in a court case in 2021. In September 2018, he also tweeted that he had written to Nigeria's financial-crimes regulator, accusing Alpha Beta of tax evasion - the actual letter that accompanied the tweet, which detailed the allegations, has since been deleted from his account. Alpha Beta denied the allegations and said Mr Apara had been sacked for fraud, which he denied. Mr Tinubu has consistently denied links to the firm, but was a party to an undisclosed settlement between Alpha-Beta and Mr Apara last June, leading to the termination of the parties' claims against each other. The BBC asked Mr Tinubu about the settlement, the US allegations and the questions over his wealth but he did not reply to a request for comment. Mr Abubakar touts himself as the most experienced candidate on the ballot, having served as vice-president between 1999 and 2007 - and it is this period around which there is some controversy. His former boss, ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo, accused him of embezzling $145m from the Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF) in 2003. Mr Obasanjo, who does not shy away from publicly sharing his opinions about other politicians, dedicated a chapter in his book My Watch, published in 2014, to the alleged transgressions of his former deputy. Mr Abubakar denied the accusations, saying $145m was placed in commercial banks to accrue interest so it could be ploughed back into PTDF projects. The 76-year-old said he first made money from farming and owning houses in his home state of Adamawa. A former customs officer, he said that he recognised early in life that he had ""a good nose for money"".  It was in the 1980s that he established an oil-servicing firm that catapulted him into the world of the wealthy. Opponents have accused him of flouting a law that prohibits civil servants from engaging in private business other than farming.  Mr Abubakar's spokesperson described his venture as a small business that many public servants engage in, such as using their car as a taxi or setting up a shop in front of their house to support their families. ""He only invested his income to earn interest. He was not doing any other work in form of private work like you are inferring,"" Paul Ibe told the BBC. In 2010, a US Senate committee report alleged that between 2000 and 2008, Mr Abubakar, through one of his four wives, transferred more than $40m in ""suspect funds"" into the US from offshore shell companies.  The report claimed that at least $1.7m of this came from bribes paid by German technology company Siemens, which pleaded guilty to bribery charges in 2008 and agreed to pay a $1.6bn fine. He was also a major figure in the corruption trial of former US Congressman William Jefferson, who in the Senate report described Mr Abubakar as ""really corrupt"" and said he needed money to bribe him to approve a US company's business deals in Nigeria.  Mr Jefferson was convicted in 2009 and sentenced to 13 years in prison, which was subsequently reduced. Mr Abubakar has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and neither he nor his now-divorced wife face criminal charges in the US.  ""Atiku Abubakar is not on trial for corruption or any other misconduct either in Nigeria or any foreign land,"" Mr Ibe said. ""He can only be unfit for public office when he is indicted by a court of law. That is not the situation."" Peter Obi, who has also served two terms as governor - in his case in the eastern Anambra state, does not hide his immense wealth, which he says has been made through banking and importing various goods into Nigeria. Dubbed ""Mr Clean"" by his supporters for being a rare Nigerian politician without accusations of embezzling public funds, it came as a surprise to many when his name came up in 2021 in the Pandora Papers. This was a leak of almost 12 million documents that revealed the hidden wealth, tax avoidance and, in some cases, allegations of money laundering by some of the world's rich and powerful.  Nigeria's Premium Times, one of the newspapers that worked on the Pandora Papers investigation, alleged the documents showed that in 2010, when Mr Obi was Anambra governor, he set up a company, named after his daughter, in the British Virgin Islands to help him avoid tax.  Making use of a tax haven is not illegal, though setting up foreign bank accounts when serving as a public officer is not allowed. The Premium Times said this showed Mr Obi had failed to declare his assets, and it also alleged that he had failed to resign from the UK-registered company Next International, of which he was director when he became governor - engaging in private business, which is not allowed for public officers. His resignation was registered 14 months into his term. The 61-year-old has never been charged over any of the revelations. Mr Obi told the BBC an impeachment trial had investigated the allegations surrounding his business affairs in 2006 and found he had acted within the law. He added that he had established a blind trust to oversee his business arrangements, including the family's offshore holdings. ""A blind trust is allowed within the law,"" he said. Mr Obi has also been accused of a conflict of interest after investing $20m of state funds while governor in a brewery, in which his family hold shares through Next.  He denies the allegations, saying the investment greatly benefited Anambra over the years. There has also been criticism that Anambra invested in Fidelity Bank, where he was once chairman. ""Anambra state invested in Fidelity Bank, where I have interests, because it is a public quoted company,"" he told the BBC, dismissing any suggestion that any of the revelations about his finances cast doubt about his fitness for office. In the last week, a corruption row has blown up between Mr Abubakar's and Mr Tinubu's camps. Each accuses the other's candidate of siphoning public funds through proxy companies known as special purpose vehicles (SPVs) while in office, saying this makes them ineligible to run, with a campaign spokesman from Mr Tinubu's APC saying he is taking the case to court. Both deny the allegations, but the issue is now dominating rallies.   But the general issue about addressing corruption has not been a major talking point during this electoral campaign. This is in stark contrast to the frenzied anti-corruption promises that saw President Muhammadu Buhari elected in 2015. The 80-year-old is stepping down this year, but analysts argue he has done little to tackle the problem while in office. ""Maybe Nigerians are too familiar with corruption and have noticed that nothing fundamental is changing,"" said Mr Rafsanjani. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64223454
Nigeria elections 2023: How influencers are secretly paid by political parties,"A BBC investigation has discovered that political parties in Nigeria are secretly paying social media influencers to spread disinformation about their opponents ahead of general elections in February.  The BBC's Global Disinformation Team has spoken to whistle-blowers working for two of Nigeria's political parties, and prominent influencers who have described it as ""an industry"".  The whistle-blowers say parties give out cash, lavish gifts, government contracts and even political appointments for their work.  We changed their names to protect their identity. ""Yemi"" is a prominent strategist and ""Godiya"" a politician.  ""We've paid an influencer up to 20m naira ($45,000; £37,000) for delivering a result. We've also given people gifts. Other people prefer to hear: 'What do you want to do in government, be a board member, be a special assistant?',"" says Godiya.  Situation rooms are commonplace in the run-up to an election. It's where political parties strategise, develop plans and monitor their campaigns' success. But in the rooms the whistle-blowers described to us, there was another function: following how false narratives assigned to influencers were performing. Strategist Yemi says fake stories are developed to improve their candidates' chances: ""You can deliberately misinform in a suitable way for you."" The BBC has spoken to multiple influencers who have confirmed that payment in exchange for false political posts is widespread.  One influencer who asked not to be named - with almost 150,000 Facebook followers - told us he is paid by political parties to post completely false stories about political opponents. He says he does not do it openly but rather plants false stories through other micro-influencers he hires. Separately, Rabi'u Biyora is a major influencer known for supporting the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) party.  He told us he was ""wooed"" by an opposition party to stop promoting the APC's candidate, and give his support to their candidate instead.  Posts on his Facebook timeline confirm he did just that. He told us he did not receive gifts of any kind to do so. But we discovered a Facebook post from 2019 in which he said he received a car and money from a party in exchange for his support on social media.  We put this finding to him, but he stopped responding to us. With an estimated 80 million Nigerians online, social media plays a huge role in national debates about politics. Our investigation uncovered different tactics used to reach more people on Twitter. Many play on divisive issues such as religious, ethnic and regional differences.  In July, influencers widely shared posts associating Kashim Shettima, the APC's candidate for vice-president, with members of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram.  This false narrative gained momentum on Twitter and was shared thousands of times, spilling onto WhatsApp and other platforms.  Using reverse image search, we found that those in the picture with Mr Shettima were nomadic Fulani parents whose children he had enrolled in secular schools in 2017, not members of Boko Haram.   A month later, influencers promoted a claim without evidence that Labour Party presidential candidate Peter Obi was linked to, and following orders from, the Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob) - a separatist movement designated in Nigeria as a terror group. His party denies this.  Those who shared this information included Reno Omokri - special assistant to former opposition President Goodluck Jonathan - who has more than two million followers on Twitter. When approached for a comment, Reno Omokri said he stands by his accusations, but insists he has not been paid by the main opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) to campaign on their behalf. Meanwhile, false claims that the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, fell ill and was rushed out of the country have been shared several times on Twitter. Godiya, the politician we interviewed, says political parties tell influencers to elicit as much emotion as they can with their paid posts.  ""We use images that may not even be relevant to the story we are trying to spin. We can take pictures from East Africa in the 1990s in warzones and attach them to a tweet about how my ethnic group is being killed. When people get emotional they retweet, they like, and it gets traction,"" she says. According to the whistle-blowers, the hired influencers are sometimes given an idea that they should frame in their own words. At other times, they are given the actual tweets that need to be published at specific times. They say influencers are paid based on the number of followers they have. They also say payment happens mostly in cash to avoid a paper trail.  It is not illegal for political parties to hire social media influencers in Nigeria, but spreading disinformation on social media is a breach of the country's laws and Twitter's policy.  The BBC has asked Nigeria's main political parties, APC, PDP, and the Labour Party, about the whistle-blowers' allegations. They did not reply to our request for comment. In response to our findings, Twitter has taken down some of the accounts we reported to them and said it had a responsibility to protect electoral conversations from interference, manipulation, and false information. However, there are concerns about the platform's capacity to tackle misinformation in Africa after Elon Musk's takeover of the company, when its continental headquarters in Ghana was closed and nearly all its staff fired.  The BBC has reached out to Twitter again after these changes, but received no response.  Idayat Hassan, director at the Centre for Democracy and Development, says the activities of these influencers amounted to ""political interference"".  ""It is undermining trust in democracy, undermining trust in the electoral system, and it is instigating conflict,"" she says.  But politician Godiya sees it a different way, and defends the tactic: ""It is a game. Somebody had to win, and God help me, I will not be on the losing side.""

Nigeria elections 2023: What you need to know,"Next month voters in Africa's most populous country, Nigeria, will head to the polls to select their next president amid mounting unhappiness in the country due to worsening insecurity and economic hardship. Will any of the frontrunners, most of whom have been in the political system for decades, be able to turn the country around? From high inflation to deadly attacks by gunmen against innocent civilians, the seven-year rule of outgoing President Muhammadu Buhari has seen Nigeria face various crises.  His supporters say he has done his best and highlight achievements, such as his work on infrastructure projects and attempts to combat violent extremism. But even his own wife, Aisha Buhari, has apologised to the Nigerian people for falling short of their expectations.  So whoever wins the election will not have an easy job. It is due to take place on Saturday 25 February 2023. If there is no clear winner, a second round will be held within three weeks. There will also be elections for the country's powerful state governors on Saturday 11 March. The head of the election commission has dismissed suggestions that the vote could be delayed because of insecurity. A total of 18 candidates are campaigning for the top job, but only three have a realistic chance of winning, according to opinion polls. Bola Ahmed Tinubu, 70, is standing for the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) party. Known as a political godfather in the south-west region, he wields a huge amount of influence but has been dogged by allegations of corruption over the years and poor health, both of which he denies. Some say his campaign slogan Emi Lokan, which means ""it's my turn [to be president]"" in the Yoruba language, shows a sense of entitlement. Atiku Abubakar, 76, is running on behalf of the main opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP). He has run for the presidency five times before - all of which he has lost. Most of his career has been in the corridors of power, having worked as a top civil servant, vice-president under Olusegun Obasanjo and a prominent businessman. Just like Mr Tinubu, he has been accused of corruption and cronyism, which he denies. Peter Obi, 61, is hoping to break up the two-party system which has dominated Nigeria since the end of military rule in 1999 and is running for the little known Labour Party. Although he was in the PDP until last year, he is seen as a relatively fresh face and enjoys fervent support on social media and amongst Nigeria's youth. The wealthy businessman served as governor of the south-eastern Anambra State from 2006 to 2014. His backers, known as the ""OBIdients"" say he is the only candidate with integrity, but his critics argue that a vote for Obi is wasted as he is unlikely to win. Convention suggests a candidate from one of the two main parties will win - Mr Atiku or Mr Tinubu. But Mr Obi's supporters are hoping he can spring a surprise if they can mobilise the large youth vote to back him. In order to win, a candidate has to obtain the highest number of votes nationwide, and more than a quarter of ballots cast in at least two-thirds of Nigeria's states. If none of the candidates manage this, there will be a second round, or a run-off, within 21 days between the top two candidates.  Reducing insecurity is one of the key concerns of voters, in a country which is currently experiencing a kidnapping-for-ransom crisis and battling a militant Islamist insurgency in parts of the north. Two of the most shocking cases last year were a mass shooting at a Catholic Church in Owo and the storming by gunmen of a passenger train in which dozens of people were killed or kidnapped. President Buhari says he has fulfilled his promise to ""frontally and courageously tackle terrorism"", but many Nigerians feel the country is still not safe. The economy is another area of concern. In 2022 inflation rose for 10 months in a row, just dipping to 21.3% according to the latest figures released this month. This rising cost of living has left many families struggling to make ends meet, with local media describing the situation as ""dire"". Unemployment is also a major problem, leaving many graduates fearful that they may not find work even after years of university study. Latest figures from the country's National Bureau of Statistics show that 33% of the population is unemployed - jumping to 42.5% for younger adults. Despite being a major oil producer, four out of 10 Nigerians live below the poverty line and ""lack education and access to basic infrastructure, such as electricity, safe drinking water, and improved sanitation,"" according to the World Bank.  Many of the candidates have put these issues at the centre of their campaigns.  But these problems have been mounting for several years, leaving some Nigerians sceptical about whether whoever wins the election will actually be able to fix them. Despite the large number of registered voters -  93.5 million - concerns persist about apathy and how many people will actually show up on the day to cast their ballot.  With almost 40% of registered voters under 34, the vote has been called the ""election of young people"" by elections chief Mahmood Yakubu. In previous elections in Nigeria there have been credible reports of politicians rigging the polls, by either causing violence to scare away voters or snatching ballot boxes and stuffing them. But the Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) says the use of new technology will help ensure the ballot is secure and is not marred by fraud or rigging. There have also been cases of politicians paying poor voters to back them, even at polling stations. But a recent change of the naira notes has forced a cash crunch that will make vote-buying difficult, and security agents also arrest suspects who either give or receive money. Inec has also said it is illegal for voters to take phones into the polling booths and take pictures of their ballot papers, as this proof is usually demanded by the vote buyers. Some Inec offices have been attacked in the run-up to the vote. Last November the election body held an emergency meeting over the attacks on its buildings, which local media described as a ""disturbing trend"". There have also been complaints about suspicious voter registration. Last year digital sleuths uncovered voter cards on the digital electoral register that appeared to have pictures of children on them. The legal age to vote in Nigeria is 18. Some others on the preliminary list seemed to have registered more than once, by changing their facial expression, clothes or the way they were sitting. At the time of the discoveries, Inec said it welcomed the help of Nigerians to clean up the register. On 11 January, Inec released a new register, from which it said 53,264 ineligible voters had been removed. It also said that underage voters and vote buyers would be prosecuted.  As well as the presidential vote, the public will also be choosing their representatives for parliament - the National Assembly. There are 469 legislators made up of 109 Senators and 360 members of the House of Representatives. Two weeks later on 11 March there will also be elections to choose governors for 28 out of Nigeria's 36 states. In order to vote, you need to have a valid Permanent Voter's Card (PVC), which essentially shows that you are registered to vote and proves the identity of the voter. The PVC contains biometrical data of the voter, used as further verification on election day. This data is stored in the card. However, there is limited time, as the deadline for getting a PVC is 5 February. To cast your ballot, you need to arrive at your polling station between the hours of 08:00 and 14:00 with your PVC. As long as you're in the queue to vote by 14:00, you will be allowed to cast your ballot, Inec says. Nigerians living in the diaspora are not allowed to vote abroad. This election is different to previous ones because a new system is being used - the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), which is a device introduced by Inec in 2021 aimed at stopping election fraud. The BVAS is essentially a small rectangular box with a screen that is more technologically advanced than the Smart Card Readers used in the past. The key benefit of the BVAS is that it has the capacity to perform dual identification of voters on election day through their fingerprints and facial recognition. This should stop people without valid PVCs from voting, as well as those who are ineligible to vote attempting to do so.  Another aspect of the BVAS is that it uploads vote results directly to the Inec results viewing portal for all to see, which in theory means results cannot be tampered with.  There have been concerns about the BVAS after it experienced glitches in state-wide elections in 2021 and 2022, but Inec insists these problems have been resolved. In the last two presidential elections the winner has been known on the third day after voting. But votes will be counted as soon as voting ends on Saturday 25 February. Those who stay behind at their polling station will have the result announced to them, but it is a long process before all the results work their way up to Abuja from the tens of thousands of polling units across the country. BVAS might speed up the process this year, but Inec-appointed officials will still have to travel to Abuja from the 36 states with hard copies to be read aloud. Only then will the Inec chairman announce a winner - or that a second round is needed. Additional reporting by Nduka Orjinmo in Abuja ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64187170

Northern Ireland Protocol: Tories back DUP over border posts,"Brexiteer Conservative MPs and the Democratic Unionist Party have joined forces to send a warning to government over the Northern Ireland Protocol. They have signed an early day motion calling for the scrapping of plans to construct permanent border control posts at Northern Ireland ports. It follows a government decision to take control of the construction in the absence of a Stormont executive. But Alliance and the Social Democratic and Labour Party dismissed the motion. The SDLP leader accused the DUP of ""constant negative agitation"" over the protocol. Early day motions are used by MPs to demonstrate the level of parliamentary support for a particular cause but they are seldom debated in the House of Commons chamber. This motion has been signed by all eight DUP MPs and six backbench Conservatives, including former ministers Jacob Rees-Mogg and David Jones. It challenges the decision to construct the border posts, stating that they ""give effect to a customs border that divides the UK, treating Northern Ireland like a foreign country"". The motion adds that the purpose of the border posts ""is to protect the integrity of a different legal regime in Northern Ireland created by laws"" imposed in more than 300 areas. The protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, avoiding the need for a hard border with the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. Special trading arrangements were required for Northern Ireland because of its land border with the Republic of Ireland, which is in the EU. The DUP and other unionist parties object to trade barriers being erected between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Early day motions are a useful tool when it comes to sending a message to the government In this case it is a timely reminder to the prime minister that he will face battle on his backbenches if he agrees a deal on the protocol with the EU which falls short of the DUP's demands. But Rishi Sunak will have already factored that into his calculations and if the changes agreed do not require a vote in Westminster then he will be dealing with noise and not divisions on the benches behind him. The DUP also does not need reminded that those who are lining up to support them now are the same Brexiteer MPs who voted for the protocol in Boris Johnson's 2019 deal. Under the new legislation the Northern Ireland secretary will have the power to take the appropriate steps in ""constructing facilities for performing official controls"" as laid out in EU rules. He will also have the authority to recruit and employ suitability qualified staff to carry out checks and he can do so regardless of what has been agreed by the Stormont executive. Alliance Party MP Stephen Farry criticised the DUP motion, insisting the border control posts are a requirement to implement the Northern Ireland Protocol and are also included in the government's controversial Protocol Bill which provides for red and green lanes at ports ""This secondary legislation is part of the UK demonstrating that it can be a trusted partner and respect legal requirements,"" he said. ""Such actions are a platform for delivering a much more flexible or lighter touch arrangements across the Irish sea."" SDLP leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood said the DUP motion asking the government to ""renege on their legal obligations under the Withdrawal Agreement is no way to build trust"". He added: ""Maybe the DUP should spend more time talking about a resolution acceptable to all sides rather than constant negative agitation during a negotiation which it appears is making progress.""

Is Brexit costing £1m a day and other claims,"Former Labour communications and strategy chief, Alastair Campbell, was involved in a Radio 4 debate on Tuesday 31 January about how Brexit is going with, among others, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative former minister for Brexit opportunities.  In an exchange with Mr Rees-Mogg about official trade figures, Mr Campbell said: ""The ONS (Office for National Statistics) have also said that Brexit is costing us a million pounds a day."" Reality Check contacted Mr Campbell about this claim and he corrected himself, saying that it was actually £1m an hour (he also tweeted this correction). He added that it was not the ONS that said it - the line was in a briefing from the European Movement, an organisation that supports the UK rejoining the European Union (EU).  The £1m an hour figure was quoted by its director of communications on Politics Live in September 2022. Reality Check asked the European Movement where the figure came from and was pointed towards an interview with the head of consumer research at the delivery company ParcelHero. The calculation used was to look at the UK's export of goods to the EU in 2021, which ParcelHero said was down £20bn compared with 2018.  After analysing this dataset, we make it a fall of £18.5bn, but it was certainly reported as £20bn at the time and these figures are revised regularly. ParcelHero then took off the £11bn net contributions it said the UK wasn't making to the EU budget after Brexit, to give £9bn for the year, which is indeed about £1m an hour. But this is not a good way to measure the impact of Brexit on the economy because: The recovery in UK exports in 2022 was what Mr Rees-Mogg highlighted. He compared figures for the third quarter (July to September) of 2022 with those for the same period of 2015, before the EU referendum. ""Our exports to the EU in that period rose from £56bn to £90bn, and with the rest of the world from £73bn to £128bn and these are the ONS figures, which I would encourage people to look up,"" Mr Rees-Mogg said. You can find those figures for exports to the EU here, and for exports to the rest of the world here. By that measure, there has been a considerable recovery in UK exports since the pandemic.  But much of that may be because of rising inflation, so UK exporters are not exporting more, it is just that the prices have gone up. If you look at the inflation-adjusted ONS figures for total exports, the increase between the third quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2022 is 15%.  This is considerably less than the 70% increases in total exports that Mr Rees-Mogg referred to. But the inflation-adjusted ONS figures in the chart below have still not recovered to pre-pandemic levels. And again, just looking at what has happened to UK exports is not an ideal measure of the impact of Brexit on the economy.  What we are interested in is not how much better or worse the economy is doing than before the EU referendum - we need a measure of how much better or worse the UK is doing than it would have done if it had voted to stay in the EU. That is not a straightforward thing to do. UK in a Changing Europe has tried to do it by comparing the UK with other advanced economies, and it found that UK trade had not recovered as well as others. ""It is difficult to explain this marked underperformance except by reference to the direct and indirect impacts of Brexit,"" it said. And there have been other attempts to measure the impact of Brexit on the UK economy. For example, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, which comes up with economic forecasts for the government, estimated the new trading relationship with the EU would reduce long-term UK productivity by 4% compared with remaining in the EU.  It also predicted that exports and imports would both be about 15% lower in the long run than if the UK had stayed in the EU.  What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Howells: Cardiff department store is set to close,"A landmark Cardiff city centre department store is set to close its doors after more than 150 years.

Steven Bartlett: Firm founded by Dragons' Den star to sell for £7.7m,"Social Chain, the social media agency founded by Dragons' Den star Steven Bartlett, is set to be sold in a deal worth at least £7.7m.   Brave Bison, the social and digital media group, announced that it had a struck a deal to buy the company.  Mr Bartlett, 30, founded Social Chain in Manchester in 2014. He stepped down as CEO of Social Chain in 2020 and it is not known whether he retained a stake in the company and would benefit from any future sale.

Samsung boss says he would not give a child under 11 a smartphone,"The UK boss of Samsung Mobile has said he would not have given his daughter a smartphone before she was 11. But James Kitto stressed the decision to give a child a phone was down to ""parental choice"" and said safe internet browsing was paramount. It comes after Ofsted's chief inspector said she was ""surprised"" when primary school children have smartphones. Children as young as nine have been exposed to online pornography, a study found this week. Mr Kitto, who took the role at Samsung in December last year, told the BBC's Today programme: ""From my personal perspective, my daughter got a smartphone when she was 11. ""I personally wouldn't have given her one early, but it is a parental decision as to when you should get your child a phone. ""And whatever choice you make, and whatever age you make that choice for your child, it is important to ensure that, if they are accessing the internet, they are accessing it in a safe way,"" he said. All mobile phone providers give free parental control services to limit what children can see on the internet, according to the telecoms regulator, Ofcom, which also says children should be careful when sharing pictures and social networking. A study by research firm Childwise suggests that three-quarters of nine and 10-year-olds have access to a mobile phone. That breaks down as 60% owning a mobile phone, and 14% using a family member's or friend's. More than two-thirds of those children go online. The same report - Childwise Monitor 2023 - found that 8% of five and six-year-olds own their own phone, and 8% have access to a family member's or friend's, while for seven and eight-year olds, those figures are 43% and 23% respectively. Earlier this week, Ofsted's chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, said she was ""surprised"" when primary school children have smartphones. She said she was was ""not comfortable"" with younger children having unlimited internet access, and said there was a ""great deal"" that can be done to limit children's access to porn and adult content. Earlier this week, the findings of a survey by the Children's Commissioner for England suggested that by age nine, 10% of children had seen pornography, and 27% had seen it by age 11. The findings have been linked to low self-esteem among young people and harmful views of sex and relationships. Commissioner Dame Rachel de Souza said it was ""deeply concerning"".

Cancer patient's medical supplies donated to Ukraine,"A cancer victim's family has donated his unused medical supplies to Ukraine.  Mark Lindesay, a pub landlord in Cirencester, was diagnosed with throat cancer and died in October.  His sister Jenny Lockwood did not want the supplies to go to waste but was told the NHS could not use them due to rules about cross-contamination. Lukasz Woloszyn, a volunteer with Gloucester Ukrainian Aid has arranged instead to take the medical supplies to help people in war-torn Ukraine. Mark Lindesay, from Cheltenham, ran The Golden Cross pub since 2009 and was a ""well-loved"" member of the community. He was diagnosed with throat cancer in the summer of 2021 shortly after returning from a three-month stay in France.  Mrs Lockward said: ""He was very optimistic in everything he did.  ""He was always off to the next adventure and he was very interested in what was going on in the world. ""He never complained, but the cancer was tough."" She said her brother had a tracheotomy and needed a feeding tube before his death, having lost the use of his voice.  His cancer treatment meant he had thousands of pounds worth of medical supplies including syringes, dressings, medication and tubes.  The UK Government has donated crutches, wheelchairs and other supplies to the frontline to help treat causalities of the Russian offensive and charities have also been donating supplies to the frontline.  Mrs Lockwood said: ""We saw the extent of it, all the tubes he needed, we don't know what half of it is, most is sterile, in original packaging and can be used. ""We tried talking to the district nurses and hospice but they didn't know so we looked further afield for charities and actually found Lukasz."" The belongings were classed as medical supplies - not equipment- which meant they could not be taken back by the NHS due to infection control regulations.  The NHS and charities in the UK do take back used equipment, such as crutches and wheelchairs, for reuse following an effort in 2018 to reduce the NHS's carbon footprint.  Mrs Lockwood said it was ""fantastic"" her brother's supplies could be used anywhere but especially in Ukraine where there was a ""real need"". ""It is a way of helping out and maybe others will get the same idea and see this is something they can do,"" she said. Lukasz Woloszyn works with Gloucester Ukrainian Aid - a volunteer force helping to support people in Ukraine.  He said: ""It will go straight to hospital, to frontline to help those people who will be injured. ""That medical equipment will be very helpful as lots of people get injured and it's very good stuff. ""Things have changed - we are asked to take medical equipment, it's quite important because it's not only soldiers getting injured.  ""Private houses get bombed etc... so more stuff is needed. ""We take out supplies at least once a month depending on the amount of stuff we manage to create for a journey."" He said the donations made a ""big difference"" to the people in Ukraine.

Witney woman buys and delivers ambulance to Ukraine border,"A woman bought a specially-converted Land Rover ambulance and delivered it to the Ukrainian border in Poland. Alina Skuba, originally from Ukraine, now lives in Witney where she owns a wellness centre.  She raised the £16,000 for the 4x4 emergency vehicle thanks to the support of her customers, local community and friends. Ms Skuba and her partner Dominic Boyett drove the ambulance to the border last week before returning to the UK. The couple drove through France, Germany and Poland, finally dropping off the vehicle at a volunteering centre near the border before it heads to the frontline just outside of Donetsk.  ""It was a long journey but it was worth it,"" Ms Skuba said, adding: ""If you can save at least one life than it's a worthwhile trip."" Last year, the 33-year-old fundraised for three ambulances that have already been taken to Ukraine.  But she said converted ambulances were needed now to reach soldiers in trenches on the frontline. Ms Skuba, whose brother is still in Ukraine. now plans to organise a charity dinner to raise funds for further support for her home country.

Ukraine: Medic Kateryna tells of mercy trips to help wounded,"A Ukrainian doctor who sought sanctuary in Grantham after the Russian invasion has spoken of her mercy trips back to her homeland. Kateryna Buchatska, 27, and her mother Elena fled Irpin, arriving in the Lincolnshire town in June last year. However, knowing she had sought-after skills, the pair have made several trips back to Ukraine. Kateryna, who has worked in military hospitals, said: ""It was good experience but... it destroys you."" In all, the mother and daughter have returned to Ukraine four times in the past six months. Kateryna said: ""It is completely different to what I would actually like to do. I hope my future will be in maternity."" She said she had recently spent three months at a military hospital in the Zaporizhzhya region, which has been the focus of repeated Russian attacks. Her voice quaking, Kateryna said she had performed her ""most difficult"" operation on a ""brave man"" who suffered traumatic injuries in the fighting. ""He was so young,"" she recalled. When mother and daughter returned to Ukraine the first time, they immediately noticed how much had changed. ""All the houses around us were destroyed,"" she said. ""It was scary to see it. They [Russian soldiers] had stolen everything from our home."" Kateryna's sponsor, Karen and Andy Marlor, offered sanctuary after signing up to the Homes For Ukraine scheme via Facebook. The couple were there to meet Kateryna and her mother when they touched down at Birmingham International Airport. Kateryna said: ""We were scared, of course. We did not know anybody. We saw their smiles and a big placard with our names and our flag. We just forgot about being exhausted. They are such lovely people."" In the absence of wailing sirens, Kateryna said she and her mother ""slept like a log"". ""Everyone has been kind to us,"" said Kateryna. ""Karen is my English mother."" Karen, a former teacher, said, when Russian invaded, her ""heart was breaking"". She said: ""I wanted to do something to help."" As they prepare to return to Ukraine again, the pair said they had a message for the people of Grantham. Kateryna said: ""We would like to say thank you. We are so lucky to be here, with such a lovely family.""   Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Send your story ideas to yorkslincs.news@bbc.co.uk.

"Bakhmut, Kyiv, and the other key Ukrainian cities and towns in Russia's sights","You're going to hear the term ""spring offensive"" a lot in the coming weeks of the war in Ukraine.  In a traditional military sense, it's when armies look to generate momentum after using the poor winter conditions to replenish.  It is true that the fighting has become more static during typically cold conditions.  However, all signs seem to be pointing towards an upcoming Russian push.  Moscow has mobilised hundreds of thousands more men, as well as increased its production of weapons and ammunition.  Kyiv is expecting to see major attacks from the east and south as soon as 24 February, which would mark a year since the full-scale invasion.  So, if Russia does launch another offensive, what will it try to take? It's the eastern city which has been grabbing the headlines because of the endless conflicting claims over who controls it.  For now, Kyiv isn't hinting at a tactical retreat. It claims the Russians are suffering about 500 casualties per day as they stage relentless attacks. Ukraine reckons its own losses are not as high. Regular Russian forces appear to have replaced mercenaries from the Wagner Group as they continue to surround the city. For now, Ukrainian troops are continuing to hold it.  If or when the city falls, invading forces are expected to push towards the cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. It could allow Moscow to capture the entire eastern Donetsk region, one of its official goals.  But that would involve capturing more than 4,000 square miles (10,360 sq km). In a period where Russia has been making minimal, costly gains, the Ukrainians would have to be seriously overpowered, or taken by surprise.  After trying and failing last November, Russian forces have started launching attacks on the small town of Vuhledar, also in the Donetsk region. It sits on the south-eastern curve of the current battlefield and is significant for Moscow for two reasons.  Firstly, it's close to the only rail line linking the annexed Crimean peninsula and Russian-controlled territories in the east. It's from Vuhledar that Ukrainian forces have been firing artillery at Russian supply trains.  Vuhledar is like Bakhmut in that for the Russians it carries more symbolic than military significance. Ukraine is convinced Moscow is going to chase its two main goals as quickly as possible.  Alongside capturing the whole of Donbas (Luhansk and Donetsk regions), Russian President Vladimir Putin is thought to be looking to widen the land corridor he has seized between Crimea and Russia.  The capture of Vuhledar would certainly go towards those - but it would be more valuable to the Kremlin in a propaganda sense. Military milestones help the Kremlin to justify its ""special military operation"" back in Russia, as well as appease critics.  They also could provide President Putin with a political way out, if he can keep hold of what he seizes.  Away from the eastern front, the conflict line south of the city Zaporizhzhia is another direction Kyiv is worried about.  The concern is that Russian forces could push north towards the towns of Orikhiv and Pokrovsk (the latter is in Donetsk region).  If this were to happen, it would push back the firing positions of longer-range Ukrainian missiles which can strike deep into the land corridor Russia controls further south.  Given that American HIMARS have been able to travel up to 80km (50 miles), and are about to go up to 120km, the occupied cities of Melitopol and Tokmak are comfortably within Ukraine's range.  Moscow is also wary of a Ukrainian advance here too towards Melitopol. Kyiv has talked about the importance of the city before, saying its liberation would allow Ukraine to cut off Russian supply routes to Crimea.  However, Valeriy Zaluzhnyy, the Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine's Armed Forces, has also admitted his troops don't have the numbers of equipment for such an attack. Despite being less than 25 miles from the border with Russia, Ukraine's second largest city in the north-east has never fallen into Moscow's control.  Like so many areas, it has been mostly torn apart from Russia's attempts to snatch it from Kyiv's control. Kharkiv's population has endured almost constant missile strikes and resulting blackouts throughout this winter.  Authorities say while there hasn't been an increase in nearby enemy forces, Russians have been shelling civilian areas more frequently.  Some officers in the local military have said they ""wouldn't be surprised"" if the Russians launched another attack, especially with the frozen ground. While there is no guarantee Russia could take a city it has failed to penetrate over the past year, its capture would bring a significant strategic advantage.  Invading forces could seal the city off from Kyiv, which could prevent Ukrainian troops currently south of Kharkiv from retreating to the capital. Ukraine's capital is still Russia's ultimate prize. However, this isn't 2022.  Last year, joint military exercises between Belarus and Russia turned into an advance on Kyiv when Moscow used its ally as a launchpad for its invasion.  At the start of this year there were fears of history repeating itself when both countries announced drills once more - this time in the form of ""defensive"" air force exercises north of Ukraine.  Belarus denied it had plans to join the invasion. Moscow rejected claims it had tried to force it.  Now, both the West and Ukraine seem to agree on there being no intelligence suggesting the capital could be under the threat it faced last year. Plus, Russia used its best-trained forces during its first attempt, when its goal was to topple the Ukrainian government.  ""We do not see formed assault groups capable of reaching Kyiv,"" said Ukraine's outgoing Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov. ""Besides, it is impossible to capture Kyiv in principle. It is a large city with four million people, ready to defend themselves."" If Russia indeed launches a large-scale offensive and gains momentum, Mr Reznikov's successor could give a different assessment. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64533495
What is hybrid warfare? Inside the centre dealing with modern threats,"Mysterious underwater explosions, anonymous cyber attacks and subtle online campaigns to undermine Western democracies - these are all ""hybrid threats"". The BBC visited a centre dedicated to targeting a relatively new form of warfare which is increasingly concerning Nato and the EU.  ""It is about manipulation of the information space. It's about attacks on critical infrastructure,"" explains Teija Tillikainen, when asked to define hybrid warfare. She is director of the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats (Hybrid CoE), which was established in Helsinki, Finland, six years ago.  Ms Tillikainen says it is an ambiguous threat format, which is something nations find very difficult to counter and protect themselves against.  But these threats are very real. Last September, powerful underwater explosions beneath the Baltic Sea ripped gaping holes in the Nord Stream gas pipelines between the coasts of Denmark and Sweden. The pipelines were constructed to carry Russian gas to northern Germany.  Moscow was quick to deny any responsibility, but Western suspicions centred around a potential Russian motive to further starve the West of energy, as punishment for backing Ukraine after Russia's invasion last February. Then there is electoral interference. Few people realised at the time, but after the 2016 US elections, investigators concluded there had been concerted Russian interference - again, denied by Moscow - with the aim of damaging Hillary Clinton's chances, in favour of Donald Trump.  This was allegedly conducted using online ""bots"" - artificial online accounts on social media controlled by state-backed cyber activists, working out of ""troll factories"" in St Petersburg. Another method is disinformation - the deliberate propagating of an alternative, false narrative, often one that appeals to certain more receptive sections of a population. This phenomenon has accelerated since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with millions of citizens - not just in Russia but even in Western countries - accepting the Kremlin's line that the invasion was a necessary act of self-defence. To help Western governments identify and protect themselves against these threats, Nato and the EU set up the Hybrid CoE in Finland. The country is an interesting and perhaps natural choice for such a centre. For decades, it has stayed officially neutral, ever since it lost a short winter war with Russia in 1940. But the two countries share a border which is 1,300km (807 miles) long, and a nervous Finland has been drawing ever closer to the West, culminating in its application to join Nato last year. On a cold, snowy morning, I visited the centre, housed in an office block close to the defence ministry and just a short distance from the grey, Soviet-era Russian embassy building. There, director Teija Tillikainen leads a team of around 40 analysts and subject-matter experts drawn from a number of Nato and EU countries, including a Briton on loan from the Ministry of Defence. She explains that a current area of focus is in the Arctic, where they have mapped a lot of hybrid threat potential.  ""There are new energy sources emerging,"" she explains. ""There are new possibilities for great powers to protect their interests. There's also a lot of manipulation of information.  ""The Russian narrative is the Arctic is a special region outside of conflicts where nothing bad is happening - and still Russia is building up its military there."" Perhaps the key distinguishing features of hybrid threats are that they almost never involve an actual ""kinetic"" attack - someone opening fire with a weapon. They are much more subtle, but often no less dangerous. They are also non-attributable in nature, meaning it is usually hard to determine who was behind these acts, such as the 2007 massive cyber attack on Estonia, or last year's gas pipeline explosions under the Baltic. The perpetrators take care to leave as few clues as possible. There are numerous ways one state can damage another short of direct military action. This is illustrated by a handbook drawn up by the centre, outlining maritime hybrid threats - containing 10 imaginary but highly-plausible scenarios. They range from the clandestine use of underwater weapons to declaring a control zone around an island, plus the blocking of narrow straits. One real scenario they have examined in detail was Russia's actions in the Sea of Azov prior to its invasion of Ukraine. From October 2018 onwards, in order for Ukrainian ships to progress from their home ports of Mariupol and Berdyansk through the Kerch Strait and out into the Black Sea, they first had to queue for inspection by Russian officials. These delays, says Jukka Savolainen, the director of vulnerabilities and resilience, could stretch into days or even up to two weeks, inflicting economic damage on Ukraine. But it is in the field of disinformation that the centre's experts have found the most surprising results. After collating and assessing numerous opinion polls across Europe, they have come to the conclusion that in several Nato countries, Russia is winning the information war amongst substantial portions of the population. In Germany, for example, the Kremlin's narrative that its attack on Ukraine was a necessary reaction to Nato provocation has been gaining popularity as the war continues. In Slovakia, more than 30% of those polled believed the Ukraine war was deliberately provoked by the West. In Hungary, 18% blamed ""the oppression of the Russian-speaking population in Ukraine"" for the war. Jakub Kalensky, a senior analyst from the Czech Republic, uses the analogy of water to illustrate the need to suppress Moscow's disinformation campaign. ""I wouldn't evaluate Russian disinformation as particularly sophisticated,"" he explains. ""It's not about the attractiveness of the message, but the way they achieve success is through sheer numbers. There's no reason to give these people access to social media platforms. Everyone wants to have access to fresh water, but we don't allow them to poison the water."" Ms Tillikainen says it is not the centre's role to undertake measures to counter hybrid threats - but to assess, inform and then train others to do what needs to be done to protect Europe from this growing phenomenon.

Ukraine braced for renewed Russian offensive later in February,"Ukraine's outgoing defence minister has said the country is anticipating a new Russian offensive later this month. At a news conference, Oleksiy Reznikov said not all Western weaponry will have arrived by then, but Ukraine had enough reserves to hold off Russian forces. President Volodymyr Zelensky said troops were fighting fiercely in Bakhmut, Vuhledar and Lyman. Mr Reznikov's comments came hours before it was announced that he was to be replaced as defence minister. Military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov will take his place, according to a Ukrainian politician from Mr Zelensky's party. The shake-up comes amid a series of corruption scandals that has plagued the defence ministry.  Mr Reznikov has denied media reports that some defence officials are suspected of embezzling public funds for the procurement of food for the army. Ukrainian lawmaker David Arakhamia announced the reshuffle on Sunday, saying that ""war dictates personnel policies"". Mr Reznikov, a familiar face in Ukraine's efforts to secure Western weapons, will now become minister for strategic industries. President Zelensky has already fired a number of senior officials as part of a broad anti-corruption drive across his government.  At an earlier news conference, Mr Reznikov said Russia did not have all of its resources ready to launch an offensive, but may do so anyway as a symbolic gesture, given the one-year anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion on 24 February. He said Russia was expected to prioritise taking the whole of the eastern Donbas as well as launching offensives in the south of Ukraine. Mr Reznikov made similar comments to French TV earlier this month. The defence minister also confirmed that troops would start training on German-made Leopard tanks from Monday. Mr Reznikov said Ukraine had secured new long-range missiles with a range of 90-mile (150km), but they will not be used against Russian territory - only against Russian units in occupied areas of Ukraine. ""I am sure that we will win this war,"" said Mr Reznikov, but he added that without the delivery of Western fighter jets, ""it will cost us more lives"".  Despite the flow of Western weapons to Ukraine, Russia has made gains around the Bakhmut area in recent days, as Russia's army throws more and more soldiers into combat. Russia's paramilitary mercenary group Wagner have led much of the fighting in the area. Its head, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said there are fierce battles for every street in some areas of the city, and Ukraine's armed forces were ""fighting to the last"". Russian forces have been attempting to seize control of Bakhmut for months - making it the longest battle since Russia invaded Ukraine almost a year ago. Taking the area is important to Russia as part of its aim to control the whole of the Donbas region. It would also signify a turnaround in Russia's fortunes after it lost ground in Ukraine during recent months. Speaking during his nightly address, President Zelensky said: ""Things are very difficult in Donetsk region - fierce battles."" But, he added, ""we have no alternative to defending ourselves and winning"". The UK's Ministry of Defence said Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut are getting increasingly isolated as the Russians continue to make small advances in its attempt to encircle the town. It added that the two main roads into Bakhmut were likely being threatened by direct fire. In other developments: You may also be interested in: ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64528580
Chris Parry and Andrew Bagshaw's bodies recovered in prisoner swap - Ukraine,"The bodies of two British volunteers killed in eastern Ukraine in January have been recovered as part of a prisoner swap with Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff said the bodies of Chris Parry, 28, and Andrew Bagshaw, 47, had now been returned to Ukraine. No indication has been given as to when they will be handed to British embassy staff to be flown home. The families of the men said they were killed during a humanitarian rescue. The two volunteers were last seen heading to the city of Soledar on 6 January.  Mr Bagshaw's family said the pair were attempting to help an elderly woman when their cars were hit by a shell. Soledar had been the focus of intense fighting and last month Russia's military claimed to have captured the Ukrainian salt-mine town after a long battle. The government in Kyiv disputed the claim. Despite the continued fighting in Ukraine, Andriy Yermak, Ukraine's chief of staff, said 116 Ukrainian soldiers had been released on Saturday. He said released prisoners included defenders of Mariupol, partisans from Kherson and snipers from Bakhmut, as well as two personnel from special operations. Russia's defence ministry said 63 servicemen had been returned as part of a ""complex mediation process"". It said it included people of a ""sensitive category"" thanks to the mediation of the United Arab Emirates, though it did not specify what those people did.  It is the second prisoner swap carried out between the two countries so far this year.  Mr Yermak said Ukraine is continuing efforts to bring everyone home. Mr Parry and Mr Bagshaw had been in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine doing voluntary work. In a statement issued by the UK Foreign Office last month, Mr Parry's family said his ""selfless determination in helping the old, young and disadvantaged"" in Ukraine had made them ""extremely proud"". ""We never imagined we would be saying goodbye to Chris when he had such a full life ahead of him. He was a caring son, fantastic brother, a best friend to so many and a loving partner to Olga,"" they said. They added that Mr Parry, originally from Truro in Cornwall, ""found himself drawn to Ukraine in March in its darkest hour at the start of the Russian invasion and helped those most in need, saving over 400 lives plus many abandoned animals."" Scientific researcher Mr Bagshaw was a British national but lived in New Zealand. He had been a volunteer in Ukraine since April. In a statement, Mr Bagshaw's family said last month: ""Andrew selflessly took many personal risks and saved many lives; we love him and are very proud indeed of what he did. ""The world needs to be strong and stand with Ukraine, giving them the military support they need now, and help to rebuild their shattered country after the war."" Another foreign national volunteering in Ukraine, Pete Reed, was killed in the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut - the location of heavy fighting in recent days - on Thursday.  Mr Reed, a 33-year-old American volunteer aid worker, was killed ""while rendering aid,"" according to a statement from the humanitarian aid group he founded, Global Response Medicine. The UK government has previously warned against all travel to Ukraine, saying there is ""a real risk to life"". British nationals still in Ukraine should leave immediately if it is safe to do so, it added. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64521865
Ukraine war: How two mothers retrieved their dead sons from the battlefield,"This article contains details that some readers may find distressing. Lyudmyla Kupriychuk stood crying in a muddy field. Her ex-husband was wrapping their son's body in a blanket.  ""I was hysterical,"" she explains. ""I said: 'Are we just going to drive him home in the boot of the car?'""  ""My ex-husband yelled at me: 'Calm down, we just need to get out of here'."" The divorced couple had bought an old Mercedes and travelled hundreds of kilometres. They were behind enemy lines to retrieve the body of their dead Ukrainian soldier son and now they were ploughing through fields in Russian-occupied territory pockmarked with shell craters.  After bringing the car to a halt, Anatoliy, Lyudmyla's ex-husband, walked over to some burnt-out armoured vehicles. Bodies lay scattered on the ground. ""He tore off the uniform to see if there was a tattoo on the arm,"" Ms Kupriychuk said. ""And it was there. It said: 'Never give up'."" ""That was all we could recognise our son by,"" the 40-year-old says, her voice trembling.  ""The bodies were lying out in the open for days, in the middle of nowhere. They weren't just burnt, wild animals had gnawed at them too.""  Her son Maksym was just 20 years old. He died on the second day of the Russian invasion - 25 February 2022.  Nobody had paid much attention to a middle-aged couple arriving in the Russian-held village of Tomaryne. It's about a 90-minute drive from the southern city of Kherson.  The Russians and their allies were yet to establish their administration, so it was chaotic when the couple arrived there in March 2022. They drove outside the village and met the first manned checkpoint. ""I got out of the car and walked towards a man pointing a gun at me,"" Ms Kupriychuk recalls. ""But I wasn't scared, all I felt was revulsion for these people."" Unbelievably, she says, she managed to cajole the soldiers to let them through. She showed them a photograph of her son's body and they drove to the field where Maksym died. Then, with his body in the boot, the couple started their 12-hour journey home to Vinnytsia, in central Ukraine.  There is no official data on the number of Ukrainian military deaths or missing bodies - that is classified information. As a professional soldier based in Lviv in western Ukraine, Maksym had not told his mother that his air assault force had been sent south to stop the Russian offensive. She was shocked when his girlfriend phoned and announced his death. One of Maksym's colleagues had a photo of the field where he had been killed and said his body was still there. He told her that Maksym had come under shelling, but there was no other information about the circumstances of his death.  Ms Kupriychuk phoned Maksym's military unit, and they told her to wait for information. ""Every night I was going berserk knowing that my son was lying out there in the freezing cold and there was nothing to cover him,"" she says. Days later as dawn broke, Maksym's parents set off to find him and bring his body home. They had no plan - just the photo, the village name and a contact for a local who had volunteered to guide them. Ukraine's Presidential Envoy for Servicemen's Rights, Alyona Verbytska, says 15,000 Ukrainians civilians and military personnel went missing between February and the end of 2022. They could have been killed or captured. On the Russian side, up to 600 soldiers are missing in Ukrainian territory, excluding occupied areas, according to data from the BBC's Russian service. People are using any means they can to find their loved ones.  A famous TV anchor started a countrywide project to help with the search, and Ukrainians have also donated money for equipment such as refrigerated vans to evacuate the bodies of soldiers and return them to their families. In social media groups on Facebook and Telegram, people share information about the missing and ask for help. Natalya Karpova, also from Vinnytsia, was searching for her son, Roman. She found a photo of his body on a Russian Telegram channel in April. Russian military personnel post on these instant messaging channels, and they are often the only source of information from occupied areas. The post suggested that a sniper had killed the 30-year-old engineer. Friends of Roman called to tell her of his death, saying he'd died at the end of April. That prompted her online search. When she found the photo, she called his air force unit. ""They said it was fake and I shouldn't be relying on the aggressor's media for information,"" she says. ""They said: 'We don't have any document [saying] that your son has died'."" Ukraine's military does not comment on missing soldiers as per martial law, which means families often have to wait for the government or volunteers to help return a body. Ms Karpova, a 59-year-old doctor, quit her job to focus on finding Roman's body herself. She knew he had gone to the frontline, but not which one. The picture posted on Telegram showed his ID and gave an approximate location in eastern Ukraine.  With help from another part of the military, a drone was flown over the site, and they located his body near the village of Dovhenke, outside Izyum city in eastern Ukraine. But heavy fighting and the Russian occupation kept it off limits. Eventually, there was a breakthrough. Ukraine liberated the village in September 2022. ""It was autumn, I knew we had no time to waste,"" she says. ""When winter comes and snow falls, there would be nothing left of the body."" She quickly assembled a search team with help from local politicians and activists, as well as the military.  Under thick vegetation, and in an area full of landmines, they found Roman's body, using his military dog tag to identify him. ""I felt a load fall off my shoulders,"" his mother says, her voice breaking. ""You cannot imagine what it feels like to be unable to take your son's body home and bury him."" His body was buried back in his home city of Vinnytsia. The air force told the BBC that heavy fighting and Russia's occupation meant Roman's unit was unaware of all the deaths at the time. On returning to Vinnytsia, Ms Kupriychuk took Maksym's body straight to the morgue. ""All they let me see was my son's hand,"" she says. ""They didn't let me see his body as his head was gone."" She has turned Maksym's bedroom into a shrine. It's full of photos of him smiling as well as a bottle of his cologne and some handcrafts he made for her as a schoolboy. She takes his uniform from the wardrobe and pulls it close to her, as if hugging him. ""Nothing has changed here since he died,"" she says. For Ms Karpova, the fact she found and buried her son has brought no peace. ""My husband and I can't believe he's dead,"" she says. Ms Karpova adds that she got no support from the air force to find him, though a general later thanked her for finding Roman's body. ""I want victory now so no other mother finds herself in my situation,"" she says. The BBC was unable to reach Maksym's military unit for comment on the circumstances of his death.

Ukraine war: US to provide long-range missiles in latest aid package,"The US says additional military aid to Ukraine worth $2.2bn (£1.83bn) will include long-range missiles capable of doubling its attack range. It brings the total amount of military aid given to Ukraine to more than $29.3bn (£24.31bn) since February 2022. The package includes ground-launched small-diameter bombs (GLSDB) which can hit targets 150km (93 miles) away. But officials refused to be drawn on speculation that the munitions could be used to attack parts of annexed Crimea.  ""When it comes to Ukrainian plans on operations, clearly that is their decision,"" Pentagon spokesperson Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters.  ""This gives them a longer-range capability, long-range fires capability, that will enable them, again, to conduct operations in defence of their country and take back their sovereign territory, Russian-occupied areas."" Russia illegally annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and considers it part of its territory. But it has come under sporadic fire from Ukrainian forces in recent months.  Western nations have repeatedly ruled out providing Ukraine with offensive weapons - such as fighter jets - which it could use to strike against Russia itself.  In a tweet, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the US and President Joe Biden for the additional aid.  ""The more long-range our weapons are and the more mobile our troops are, the sooner Russia's brutal aggression will end,"" Mr Zelensky wrote. ""Together with [the US] we stand against terror.""  Previously, Ukraine's longest range weapon was the Himars rocket system, which can hit targets at a range of up to 80km (50 miles). Kyiv used the system to devastating effect during its counter-offensive in the south and east last year.  The GLSDB also gives Ukraine forces an ability to strike anywhere in the Russian-occupied Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. It also allows Ukraine to threaten Russian supply lines in the east.  Manufactured by Boeing and Saab, GLSDB is a gliding rocket with a small bomb attached, capable of striking a target within one metre of its position.  And it can be fired from a variety of weapons systems, including the Himars and M270 MLRS systems already in use in Ukraine. However, both the Pentagon and Boeing refused to comment on delivery dates for the system, with some reports suggesting that it could take up to nine months before it reaches Ukraine.  The new package - which will also include additional Himars missiles and 250 Javelin anti-armour systems - comes amid mounting concerns that Western nations have been too slow to provide fresh military aid to Ukraine.  ""GLSDB should have been approved last fall, US House of Representatives Armed Services Chair Mike Rogers said in a tweet. ""Every day it's not approved is a day it's delayed getting it into the hands of a Ukrainian ready to kill a Russian."" In recent days, reports have emerged that a Russian offensive in the eastern Donbas region has been gaining momentum, with pro-Kremlin bloggers suggesting that the town of Bakhmut, long a focal point of Russian attacks, has been surrounded from three-sides.  But President Zelensky said his forces were entrenched around the town and would not surrender it to Russian assaults.  ""We consider Backhmut to be our fortress,"" the Ukrainian leader said. ""If weapon [deliveries] are accelerated - namely long-range weapons - we will not only not withdraw from Bakhmut, we will begin to de-occupy Donbas, which has been occupied since 2014."" Mr Zelensky said earlier that a long-rumoured Russian spring offensive in the region had already begun and his Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said earlier this week that Moscow had mobilised some 500,000 troops for the renewed assault.  Meanwhile, the Ukrainian leader has been holding new EU accession talks with the bloc's leaders, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Council President Charles Michel, in Kyiv.  Speaking after the summit, Mr Zelensky said the leaders had reached an ""understanding that it is possible to start negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the European Union this year"".  But Ms von der Leyen said there were ""no rigid timelines"" in place and emphasised that Ukraine had political goals it must meet before joining the block.  The EU has repeatedly underlined the need for Ukraine to step up its fight against endemic corruption, reform its judiciary by weeding out political interference and strengthen its economy. Elsewhere, Germany has announced plans to send Leopard 1 tanks to Ukraine. The earlier model of the Leopard 2s - which Berlin has already promised to provide - can be delivered to Kyiv sooner than the advanced model.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64518532

HIV testing: 'Home tests can help remove stigma',"""We live in a society where sex is still quite a taboo topic. Just the discussion 'let's go for an STI test' can be quite a daunting thing."" For Ellie Harrison, getting a positive HIV result came as a shock. Men who have sex with other men are one of the groups most at risk of getting HIV, so for the 26-year-old - as a straight woman - it was ""the last one"" she expected. Ellie was diagnosed five years ago, through a home test small enough to fit through the letterbox. A drop of blood from a finger prick is tested, which Ellie tells BBC Newsbeat was ""easy and efficient"". This week, more free HIV tests are being offered to people in England. It's part of a government drive to improve diagnosis, which dropped off during the Covid pandemic. The kit, which arrives in plain packaging through the post, gives a result within 15 minutes. A ""reactive"" result means HIV is possible and a clinic check is needed. ""When I found out, I was petrified, and I didn't know anything about HIV at the time,"" Ellie says. ""I was just really scared of what was going to happen, what the treatment was going to be like, and if I was going to be OK."" Ellie was booked into a specialist HIV clinic and found out specific details, like the amount of virus in her blood - viral load - and the strength of her immune system. The treatment plan can be as simple as taking tablets to bring viral load down, with Ellie saying she feels HIV is ""one of the easiest medical conditions"" to manage. ""There's been a bit of a mental ride, but I think that was just my lack of knowledge at the start."" HIV medication can keep the virus at undetectable levels, meaning you cannot pass HIV on and your health is protected. Sources: Terrence Higgins Trust and NHS Ellie feels there is still a stigma around HIV, but she thinks home tests can help. ""I think there's still a lot of fear around being with someone that's got HIV or just being around knowing someone that has it and whether they can pass it on or not."" That's something Ellie has experienced, ""especially being a straight woman"". ""People that I date, I think the education in that community [young, straight men] is pretty poor,"" she says. ""I have to go through the whole process of explaining what undetectable means, that I'm actually OK."" But the ease of a home test means more people may feel comfortable getting tested. ""That's how I got diagnosed. It's so easy and efficient,"" Ellie says. ""I always say to people, I'd rather know my status and be OK, happy and healthy than not.""

Pandemic pressures squeeze doggy day care provision,"A boarding service for pet dogs has said it has had to stop taking bookings due to overwhelming demand. It comes as the Association of Dog Breeders says one in four kennels were forced closed during the coronavirus pandemic as people stayed at home. But it is estimated more than three million UK households acquired a pet during the period, creating 17m pet-owning households nationwide. Business Lola's House puts its brisk trade down to such factors.  Chloe Foster and Jack Fairclough opened their Burton-upon-Trent venture four months ago and say they are already fully booked as a growing pet-owning population seeks to travel again after the lifting of lockdown restrictions.  And with kennel places at a premium, they add they are even having to turn away potential customers. ""I don't think we realised how much demand there was,"" Ms Foster said. Mr Fairclough added: ""I think a lot of people got dogs during the pandemic and then when people had to go back to work, they're looking for a place for day care."" Since Covid restrictions eased, more people have also been considering giving up their dogs for adoption and animal welfare charities have identified a link with owners returning to work.  ""We're getting about five inquiries in one day,"" Mr Fairclough said. ""It's a lot of letting people down."" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Covid: Last chance for adults under 50 to get booster,"Adults under 50 in England have just over a week left to take up the NHS offer of a Covid booster jab.  It is the last opportunity for healthy 16-49-year-olds to get a top-up dose - if they have not yet had three jabs. The vaccine can help protect against severe illness, even if you have caught Covid before.  Appointments are available at thousands of different sites, including GP practices and high street pharmacies, up to and including Sunday 12 February.  Anyone aged 16 or over - or an at-risk child aged 12 to 15 - who has had both primary jabs, qualify for this booster, which has been available for more than a year. So far, 15,000 people have booked in for next week and there are still 391,000 appointments available, says NHS England. Amid the spread of the more contagious Omicron variant in December 2021, health officials announced a booster jab for those who had already had both of their Covid vaccinations. An already widespread vaccination programme was ramped up either side of Christmas that year to get as many people jabbed as possible. That offer of a third jab for anyone remained available throughout last year. For the past few months, a further autumn booster has been available for over-50s and some other people with health issues.  NHS England has stressed that this fourth jab is not being rolled out to healthy under-50s. The new call is for those who never took up the offer of the third dose of vaccine to come forward now.  Professor Sir Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, explained why the booster jab remained important. ""We know that having the third vaccination, the booster, is a very important part of immunity to Covid and it provides additional protection."" But Prof Whitty said it would not be available indefinitely. ""[It] is coming to an end on 12 February and I would encourage anybody who has not taken up the offer to do so before then."" After this date, the third jabs will only be offered to people considered to be at risk of serious illness, as recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). But people who have not received vaccinations at any stage are still being urged to come forward. According to the latest figures, more than 151m Covid vaccine doses have been administered in the UK: The latest publicity campaign is designed to attract any of the 10 million people who opted to st two vaccinations. The government has said it expects another autumn vaccination campaign later this year for older adults, as well as a potential spring campaign for the most vulnerable.  People with a severely weakened immune system were offered an additional third primary dose before being offered a booster this winter. The NHS Covid vaccination programme will continue to run a smaller operation after 12 February, allowing those yet to come forward for first, second, or third doses if severely immunosuppressed, to book appointments. Experts will also be keeping a close eye on new variants of Covid, in case more people need vaccinating in the future. NHS Director of Vaccinations and Screening, Steve Russell, said: ""There is just one week left of the autumn booster campaign and so if you are eligible for a booster but have yet to take up your latest dose, please do so before the end of next week. ""Whether you have had previous doses or a bout of Covid, we know that a booster is the best way to maintain protection against serious illness from Covid for yourself and your loved ones, so please do make the most of the offer while it is available and give yourself both protection and peace of mind for the year ahead."" Health officials advise people to take whichever booster they are offered, as all vaccines provide protection against becoming severely ill from Covid. The NHS is using Moderna's ""bivalent"" vaccine, which covers both the original Covid virus and the Omicron variant. It also approved a second bivalent vaccine from Pfizer. The COVID-19 vaccines currently approved for use in the UK are: Many of the first and second vaccine doses given were either AstraZeneca or (for under-40s) Pfizer or Moderna.

Climate change: Uni degree will train future disruptors,"Climate disruptors of the future will be trained by a new degree course, a college has said. Black Mountains College in Talgarth, Powys, has launched a BA in sustainable futures. It teamed up with Cardiff Metropolitan University, the Brecon Beacons National Park and industry partners. The college also claimed it was the world's first dedicated entirely to climate action, responding to ""the climate and ecological emergency"". The course will be partly classroom based, but will include placements in industry and teaching outdoors on the college's farm campus.  It also incorporates the natural landscape, the senses and the arts - students are encouraged to immerse themselves in nature - feeling, listening, even tasting the world around them.The idea is to reinforce the knowledge they learn and forge a deep connection with the world around them. CEO Ben Rawlance said the college was founded on the ethos that climate change is not only a scientific problem, but ""a problem of human behaviour, of values, of systems, of politics and economics"". Jodie Bond from Brecon Beacons National Park Authority said: ""The nature and climate emergencies are hugely important. ""We can't face these big challenges we have as a society on our own, we have to work together."" Mr Rawlance said the world of work was already changing, with corporations employing sustainability and climate officers, and this course was about ""giving students the tools to imagine a different future"". ""These young people are going to be highly valued by industry because they're going to have that holistic world view,"" he added.  ""They're going to understand how change happens and be schooled in theories of organisational change."" Those skills include critical thinking, creativity, communication, collaboration and compassion. One of the industry partners is consultancy firm Accenture, which employs 750,000 people worldwide. Chief responsibility officer Peter Lacy said there was ""insatiable"" demand for expertise in the fields of sustainability and systems change. ""[Demand] is going to increase exponentially for the kind of disruptors that can bring new thinking, new solutions to problems."" Alison Stunt is studying horticulture at the college and said the approach was not purely intellectual: ""It's not academic in that way, it's not learning from books. ""It's learning from being out there in nature and experiencing things with our whole bodies, rather than just reading about it and knowing it in an intellectual way."" Mr Rawlance admitted it was really difficult for people ""who were educated in these very strict degree programmes to get our heads around"" but was ""obvious to young people coming up now"". ""So, this is not only urgent and necessary but it's responding to the market. This is what the kids want."" Black Mountains College has received more than £500,000 in lottery funding and is in the process of securing £1.5m of social investment to fund the launch of the course.

How beavers are reviving wetlands,"We are losing wetlands three times faster than forests, according to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. When it comes to restoring them to their natural state there is one hero with remarkable powers - the beaver. Wetlands store water, act as a carbon sink, and are a source of food. The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands says they do more for humanity than all other terrestrial ecosystems - and yet they are disappearing at an alarming rate. The main problems are agricultural and urban expansion, as well as droughts and higher temperatures brought about by climate change. But if you have a river and a beaver it may be possible to halt this process. These furry sharp-toothed rodents build dams on waterways to create a pond, inside which they build a ""lodge"" where they can protect themselves from predators.  Their technique is to chew tree trunks until they fall, and to use the trunk and branches as building materials, along with stones at the base, and mud and plants to seal the dam's upstream wall. The dam causes flooding, slows down the flow of water and keeps it on the landscape longer. ""This transforms simple streams into thriving wetland ecosystems,"" says Emily Fairfax, an ecohydrologist at California State University. ""The amount of food and water available in their wetlands makes them ideal habitat for many different species. That's part of why beavers are what's known as a keystone species."" Over the past 50 years, Canada and several states across the US have reintroduced beavers. Initially this was done to restore beaver numbers, after they were hunted nearly to extinction for their fur and meat in the 19th Century. But the restoration of wetland ecosystems has also brought huge biodiversity benefits, including the return of many species of frogs, fish and invertebrates.  A study by Finnish researchers in 2018 found that ponds engineered by beavers contained nearly twice as many mammal species than other ponds. Weasels, otters and even moose were all more prevalent.  ""Beaver wetlands are pretty unique,"" says Nigel Willby, professor of freshwater science at University of Stirling. ""Anyone can make a pond, but beavers make amazingly good ponds for biodiversity, partly because they are shallow, littered with dead wood and generally messed about with by beavers feeding on plants, digging canals, repairing dams, building lodges etc.  ""Basically, beavers excel at creating complex wetland habitats that we'd never match."" A healthy wetland ecosystem also sequesters large amounts of carbon, and by acting as a sponge and soaking up floodwaters it can soften the impacts of climate change, scientists say. Wetlands store water during wet seasons and release it slowly during drought episodes. ""When you enter a period of drought, all the plants living in a floodplain rely on stored water in the soil to keep green and stay healthy. If they don't have much water to access they will start to wilt and wither and dry out,"" says Dr Fairfax. She and her team studied 10 different wildfires in five US states between 2000 and 2021 and found in each one beavers and their ecosystem engineering reliably created and preserved wetland habitat, even during megafire events. ""Beaver wetlands have a lot of stored water, so plants in them don't really feel droughts, they stay green and lush. And when wildfire came through, they were not burnt and we found that they stayed well-watered."" But experts say beavers are only part of the solution to restore wetlands. Other necessary measures include planting woodland along the banks of lakes and rivers, and restoration of peatland and saltmarsh, says Prof Willby.  And crucially, beavers are only found naturally in North America and Eurasia. Introducing them to inappropriate places can be counter-productive. This was demonstrated in Argentina and Chile, where beavers introduced from North America in the 1940s multiplied exponentially in the absence of predators, resulting in severe forest loss. The Global Wetlands Outlook published in 2021 by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands found the most widespread wetland deterioration in Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. The drastic shrinking of Lake Chad, closer to the border of Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria in West Africa is one of the most striking examples.  It has shrunk by 90% since the 1960s mainly due to a steep rise in water demand from a rapidly growing population, unplanned irrigation and now climate-change-induced drought.  ""Conflicts, mainly between farmers and cattle-rearers, over the limited remaining water of the lake was already there and now drought is further drying it up and fighting over the water has gone worse"" says Adenike Oladosu, a wetland conservation activist in Nigeria. Barron Joseph Orr, lead scientist with the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, says wetlands are often resilient ecosystems, but prolonged droughts now pose a growing threat.   ""Climate change projections show increased drought severity in drylands that could compromise wetland resilience and reduce important habitat services,"" he says. In other areas too, drought can damage wetlands, but the beaver can help protect them. There have already been more than 100 successful reintroduction projects in North America and northern Europe. In Europe the population is believed to have tripled in the last 20 years, according to Prof Willby, with beavers now re-established in most European countries. Sweden, Germany and Austria led the way, according to the Natural History Museum, but the UK followed in the early 2000s. ""The early motivation for bringing beavers back to the UK was mostly about playing a part in restoring a declining species to its native range,"" Prof Willby says. ""But the value it could have as a keystone species for other biodiversity and in natural flood management was gaining a lot more traction, and these are the arguments usually put forward now to support the local releases of translocated animals or fenced trials happening in many places.""

Cambridge congestion charge: MPs clash in BBC Politics East debate,"Action is needed to solve transport problems in Cambridge but plans for a city congestion charge faces opposition, a BBC Politics East debate has been told. The Greater Cambridge Partnership (GCP) - a body that includes three local councils, businesses and the University of Cambridge - has proposed what it calls a sustainable travel zone, covering most of the city. Vehicles that drive in the zone between 07:00 and 19:00 on weekdays will have to pay a daily charge of at least £5. The money raised will be used to pay for a £50m bus network expansion, aiming to create a ""London-style"" service, as well as improving infrastructure for walking and cycling. The BBC Politics East debate, held at the The Perse School in Cambridge, included representatives of the Conservative Party, Green Party, Labour and Lib Dems. An invited audience was also present. Peter Blake, GCP transport director, said: ""We live in a very successful environment. It's a great place to live, work and get educated."" But that has created ""challenges"" around congestion and its impact on the environment.  ""These are the potential solutions,"" he said. He said the key element to the proposals was to to ""significantly"" improve the bus network, making it ""an awful lot cheaper"" and more reliable. Roxanne De Beaux, executive director of Camcycle, supported the plans. She said: ""We need the sustainable travel zone to reduce the number of cars on our roads and provide the space and funding we need to improve our public transport and our walking and cycling infrastructure. ""We need fairer choices for all, no matter what form of transport they choose. If not now, then when? It's time to create a sustainable travel zone for Cambridge."" Mother Lucy Kingsford, 22, from Hauxton, near Cambridge, opposes the plans and said the charge would leave her and her son ""socially isolated"". ""I live just outside Cambridge with my son Leo and I have to drive into the city daily to go to work, to see my friends and family, to take my son to nursery,"" she said. ""I could not afford to pay the congestion every day and this would leave me and Leo really socially isolated."" When asked by an audience member whether he supported the plan, Daniel Zeichner, Labour MP for Cambridge, said: ""I want a transformed transport system for this city.  ""People are spending 65 hours a year stuck in traffic jams in Cambridge. What a waste of time and damage to the environment, damage to people trying to get to work and small businesses. ""We have a chance to have a transport system fit for this city. We all know that for so long this city has struggled with transport.  ""We need a new bus system that is cheap, reliable and that people can believe in. I think it is worth having a try."" Lucy Frazer, the Conservative MP for South East Cambridgeshire, said: ""I'm totally against the charge because of the impact it's going to have on my constituents who have absolutely no alternative to get into Cambridge, other than by using their cars. ""They are going to be charged when there is no alternative. I've spoken to businesses that are really concerned about the impact on their customers and on their staff.  ""I've spoken to people who work within the health sector, at Addenbrooke's [Hospital] who are concerned about staff who work there and people who use the services, who are going to be charged."" Bridget Smith, the Lib Dem leader of South Cambridgeshire District Council, said she needed further information from the consultation before deciding if the proposals were the ""right answer"". But she added: ""I drove here today because I have no choice. I live in Gamlingay. There's no bus service here but I'm privileged because I've got a car. For an awful lot of people, they don't have that choice. ""We also have 20% higher carbon emissions in Greater Cambridge than the rest of the country. The only way we are going to deal with that is take cars off the road. And congestion is bad for people's health and well-being."" Naomi Bennett, leader of the Green group on Cambridge City Council, said the debate was not just about ""yes and no"".  ""The Greens want to see better public transport and fairer choices. The problem we have with this consultation is that it is very much a work in progress and not a final product,"" she said. ""So yes we are keen to see better public transport but my party has also submitted 11 pages for improvements to the current consultation that we are keen to see.  ""This debate cannot be about yes and no. What we have to do is listen to each other and find a consensus that works for all of us."" Addenbrooke's Hospital would be within the congestion charge area. Dr Michael More, chairman of Addenbrooke's Hospital, said: ""We welcome the debate. I think everybody knows that transport is grinding to a halt in Cambridge. We do have a problem. 'Can we improve public transport sustainably?' would be a fundamental question for our staff. ""We employ 13,000 people. Some of our staff are very much against it. Some of our staff can see the benefits of it. So I welcome a debate so we can satisfy ourselves that public transport can be improved and cycling measures can be improved."" Prof Andrew Neely, Senior Pro Vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge, said the university wanted to see an improved transport system and was talking to the GCP about its plans to double its investment in buses. Candy Richards, of the Cambridgeshire Federation of Small Businesses, said she was concerned small firms would ""carry the cost"" of the congestion charge. She said a survey found that 66% of small traders needed access to a vehicle. Shapour Meftah, of the Mill Road Traders' Association, said businesses would ""suffer"" or have to ""pass on the fee to their customers"". By Ben Schofield, BBC East Political Correspondent Let's start with the areas of agreement.  Pollution and congestion: bad. Better buses in the city and county: good. That much seemed clear from all sides.  A consensus also emerged that the current proposals needed changing before they could be put in place.  The disagreements were over just how much to change them - or whether charging drivers should be dropped altogether.  But alternative ideas for raising funds for buses - or the precise stipulations about what needs to change and how - were frustratingly more difficult to spot. Yes, there are 24,000 consultation responses being crunched by the GCP, which may propose revisions in the summer.  And the trouble with tweaking the plan is that with each tweak comes the risk it won't deliver the promised benefits.  Oonagh Monkhouse, from Papworth hospital, in the audience, said the way the debate over this is handled is important. Staff, she said, are wondering about their futures.  They aren't the only ones.

Rideau Canal skating rink still closed amid mild winter,"Despite frosty weather this week, the world's longest skating rink will be closed because of a warmer-than-average temperatures. During the colder months, Ottawa's Rideau Canal turns into 7.8km (4.8 miles) of icy fun. But the canal in Canada's capital will have its latest start in over 50 years because of this year's mild winter. Temperatures dropped to -26C (-15F) on Friday, but hovered around -5C (12F) in January and -2C (28F) in December. Until this year, the latest canal opening was 2 February, in 2002 - the first and only time the canal had opened as late as February since records began in 1971. Over the past 52 years, the average start date has shifted later and later.  Before the 1995-96 winter season, the canal would typically open at the end of December. Over the last 26 years, however, the canal has typically opened on 10 January. This has been Ottawa's third warmest winter according to records dating back to 1872, Environment Canada told the Ottawa Citizen. Previous record-breakers were in 2001 and 1931. The skating season typically starts when a 30cm (1ft) thickness of good-quality ice has formed, according to the National Capital Commission (NCC), the organisation in charge of the canal. That requires about 10 to 14 consecutive days of temperatures between -10C and -20C.  Last year, the NCC partnered with researchers at Carleton University to examine the potential impact of climate change on skating on the canal. Each year Ottawa, Canada's capital city, hosts a Winterlude festival that celebrates the fun that snow and ice can bring, with tobogganing and ice sculptures, as well as skating along the canal. The annual event, which begins on Saturday, attracts as many as a million people. But the canal will not be able to open at the start of this year's festival, which puts a damper on some of the activities.  ""Our teams are working relentlessly to safely open a section of the skateway, flooding the ice surface every evening,"" said Valerie Dufour, a spokesperson for the NCC.   ""The cold snap over the weekend is good news, but we had to deal with mild temperatures and a lot of snow up until now.""  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64519440

Nigeria's CBN naira deadline: Hunting out savings from under mattresses,"In our series of letters from African journalists, Mannir Dan Ali, former editor-in-chief of Nigeria's Daily Trust newspaper, looks at the latest cash crisis to hit Africa's most-populous nation weeks before elections. Cash is king in Nigeria - electronic banking it still in its infancy. In fact very few people keep their money in banks - and it is often joked that most put any savings they have under their mattresses. According to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), less than 20% of the local currency in circulation is held by the banks.   CBN Governor Godwin Emefiele explained that of the 3.2 trillion naira ($7bn; £5.8bn) in circulation, up to 2.7 trillion was outside the vaults of commercial banks.  This is one of the reasons why he made a shock announcement in October that three of the country's higher denominations were going to be replaced. The main design change appears to be the colour of the banknotes. The 1,000 naira note has changed from brown to blue; the 500 from purple to green and the 200 from brown and blue to pink. The problem for a country where things rarely go according to plan, is that the switch has to happen in a six-week window - and after 31 January the old notes will no longer be legal tender. Midway through this window, the new notes are like gold dust and it is very difficult to get hold of them. I have only handled 10 of the crisp new notes, which I managed to get hold of when I went to a bank in the capital, Abuja, last week. I had tried to withdraw new notes from an ATM, but they are all still dispensing old notes. The bank teller who handed over to me the 10 banknotes, worth just over $20, said this was the maximum anyone could get. He even asked me to fill out my details in a notebook by his counter - a way to ensure that only genuine bank customers are getting the new notes and not those diverting them to money changers who are charging a premium for the new cash. Even the rich and powerful are facing problems getting hold of them.  On the day the new notes became legal tender, just before Christmas, I overheard a senior member of the ruling party complaining that though he personally went to his local bank, the manager there said he could only provide him with a small amount because the banks have only a very limited supply of the new notes.  These anecdotes underline the challenge of completing the currency switch. If in the major cities of Abuja, Lagos, Port Harcourt and Kano most people are yet to have sight of the new notes, it is inconceivable that they will be in circulation in sufficient numbers nationwide by the end of the month. If the exercise is to succeed there is also an urgent need to mount a publicity campaign.  Already social media is awash with instances of market women turning down the new currency, which they consider to be a poor imitation of the old one - in addition to being fearful of being conned by fraudsters.  And changing the colour of the naira is unlikely to deter kidnapping for ransom, which is prevalent in many parts of the country. Not to be left behind, the extortionists are said to be asking for ransom in the new currency, never mind that people cannot get hold it. Many Nigerians are in danger of losing their savings altogether. A large number of the 774 local governments in Nigeria do not have bank branches and even in the present era of electronic monetary transactions, such services are not commonly available in rural areas.  Of course it tends to be in rural areas where there is the peculiar practice of people keeping money in mattresses or under their beds.  Mr Emefiele has blamed this hoarding for the currency crunch. But in reality it is not the average Nigerian that is to blame for the bulk of the stockpiling. Analysts say this tends to become an issue before elections when politicians are accused of using cash to buy favours. During the 2019 election, social media had pictures and a video of a bullion van supposedly full of cash going into the residence of a senior political influencer. His aides denied accusations that it was for vote-buying. But the practice of giving voters money to cast their ballot for a particular candidate is not uncommon here. The currency change may be well-intentioned, to level the political playing field before the 25 February vote, yet the timing of it all is causing concern. The senate has asked for the switchover period to be extended but the CBN is sticking to its guns. To make matters worse, Governor Emefiele has disappeared. He has been out of the country for weeks, facing various accusations of mismanagement, which some argue may be politically motivated. Nonetheless it means the chances of completing the exchange by 31 January look slim. President Muhammadu Buhari will be stepping down in May to handover to his successor after completing two terms in office as a democratically elected leader. Yet for some it brings to mind the currency change that took place in the 1980s when Mr Buhari was the military head of state. It was a time when well-off private business people lost fortunes.

Turkey earthquake: UK rescue workers travel to help with search efforts,"British search and rescue specialists are set to travel to Turkey to help search for survivors after an earthquake killed over 4,300 people. A team of 76 rescuers are set to fly out to the country later.  Two 7.8 and 7.5 magnitude quakes devastated parts of Turkey and Syria, reducing many buildings to rubble.  Turkish communities in the UK have been sending aid to the areas affected by the earthquake since early on Monday morning. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said the impact of the quakes was ""on a scale that we have not seen for quite some time"". The confirmed death toll from Turkey and Syria has surged to 4,300 and is likely to rise further as more areas are searched and rescuers comb through mountains of rubble in freezing, snowy weather. No Britons had yet been reported dead in the disaster, said Mr Cleverly.  Development Minister Andrew Mitchell said the British team had been due to leave for Turkey on Monday night, but were delayed. On Tuesday morning he suggested they would leave ""imminently"", adding the first 72 hours were ""critical"".  He told GB News: ""I expect them to leave within the next couple of hours so that they land in daylight. And then this British expertise will be helping what is a huge, international effort to save lives."" The UK search and rescue teams have four search dogs, equipment including seismic listening devices, concrete cutting and breaking equipment, as well as a team of emergency medics to assess the situation on the ground.  No 10 said the government was looking at ways it could support humanitarian action in northwest Syria, and that its first approach would be to work through the United Nations (UN).  The Foreign Office also said in north-west Syria the White Helmets, humanitarian volunteers who received UK-funding, have mobilised their resources to respond.  David Wightwick, CEO of medical aid charity UK-Med, said he and his team were heading to Turkey on Tuesday morning to assess where their help is most needed, before mobilising their register of hundreds of NHS medics.  He told BBC Radio 4 Today programme: ""It's that decision where it's most needed which is the bit that takes up the first day or so.  ""You can imagine in an area the size affected and with the numbers affected that's not necessarily an easy decision to make.""  Paul Taylor, from humanitarian charity React, is also flying out to Turkey on Tuesday morning and said displaced people will need shelter, food, water, and medical support. He told the BBC: ""We will be focused on an assessment and then trying to identify what are the needs of the affected population, and then helping them.  ""Principally I think at this point because of the weather conditions, I think that will be shelter... ""It's upon us to bring our aid game and do everything to help people in the best way we can."" The chairman of the British Turkish Association said he had been ""inundated"" with calls from people worried about loved ones. Attila Ustun described it as a ""heartbreaking"" day for Turks everywhere and said there was ""a very large connection"" between the Turkish communities in east and north London and the area where the quake struck. He continued: ""Some were born in those cities and towns that are now a disaster zone."" Mr Ustun said people from Turkish backgrounds had been reaching out after learning family members had died, including ""one gentleman in Bedfordshire who has lost three of his uncles in one property"". He added: ""I've been inundated, I had one lady in London crying her eyes out and saying that half of her village is now rubble. ""People are ringing me asking what they can do to help."" The British Turkish Association is taking donations, particularly winter clothes, at different points across the UK. Ali Topaloglu, from the Nottingham Turkish Community, told the BBC his family had been directly affected.   He said: ""It's shocking. I can not find the words to describe the situation... it's devastating news. We lost some immediate family."" Mr Topaloglu is now part of a campaign asking for donations of tents, blankets and clothes for Turkey, as well as money for food parcels.  Countries around the world have pledged or offered support for operations in southeast Turkey and northern Syria following the disaster. Ebu Bekir Tezgel, senior Imam at Aziziye Mosque in north London, said many of its worshippers had relatives in the area of Turkey where the earthquake hit.  He said there had been prayers for those affected and efforts were being made to send emergency aid.  ""Everyone's morale is very down as you can imagine,"" he told BBC News. ""We would normally stop and talk after prayer, to sit around and have a little chat - but that didn't happen today.""  He said work would continue to gather aid to send to Turkey as well as identify members of mosque who need specific support.  Cengiz Akarsu lives in Durham, but is originally from Elaziğ in the east of Turkey. His brother moved to the city of Hatay - which has been devastated by the earthquake - for work, and has lost his house. The company he works for has moved him and his family to a hotel in Adana. He says he feels ""helpless"" knowing he ""can't do anything"".  ""It's just like your family, you know and I know, they're in trouble and you're watching them,"" he says.  ""Everyone is like family... they don't have religion, they don't have colour, they don't have country, they are just human people dying."" Mr Akarsu said his best friend had also been missing since the earthquake happened.  Charities are also launching appeals, including The British Red Cross. Its chief executive, Mike Adamson, said it was ""shocking"" to see the scale of destruction caused by this earthquake with homes, hospitals and roads destroyed across the region. ""The priority right now is rescuing people from the rubble and Red Cross Red Crescent teams are on the ground in Syria and Turkey providing urgent support during these critical hours.""

Turkey earthquake: Heavy rain hampers rescue efforts,"Rescuers are battling heavy rain and snow as they race against the clock to find survivors of a devastating earthquake in south-east Turkey. More than 4,800 people were killed and 15,000 injured in Turkey and over the border in Syria when the quake struck in the early hours of Monday. The World Health Organization has warned the toll may rise dramatically as rescuers find more victims.  As day breaks, rescue teams are stepping up their search for survivors. Many people in the disaster zone have been too scared to go back into buildings. The 7.8 magnitude tremor struck at 04:17 (01:17 GMT) on Monday at a depth of 17.9km (11 miles) near the city of Gaziantep, according to the US Geological Survey.  Seismologists say it was one of the largest ever recorded in Turkey, where at least 3,381 people are now known to have died. Survivors say it took two minutes for the shaking to stop. A later tremor had a magnitude of 7.5 and its epicentre was in the Elbistan district of Kahramanmaras province.  As dawn broke on Tuesday, traffic was at a standstill on the main highway to the Turkish city of Maras, close to the epicentre of the quake and believed to be one of the worst-affected areas.  Cars occasionally crawled forward, the wet road illuminated by glowing red brake lights. Few rescuers have made it to this part of southern Turkey yet and everyone is trying to get there as fast as they can to assess the damage and give vital help. One search and rescue team on their way to the city, their van loaded with specialist equipment and supplies, told the BBC they were eager to get there and start looking for survivors, but they had no idea how bad the devastation would be when they arrived. Almost 8,000 people have been rescued from more than 4,700 destroyed buildings, Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) said in its latest statement. As aftershocks continue, rescuers in some areas have been digging through rubble with their bare hands looking for survivors.  But freezing conditions are hampering search efforts.  In the southern province of Hatay, the Reuters news agency reported that a woman's voice was heard calling for help under a pile of rubble. ""They're making noises, but nobody is coming,"" a resident who gave his name as Deniz said while weeping. ""We're devastated, we're devastated. My God... They're calling out. They're saying, 'Save us,' but we can't save them. How are we going to save them? There has been nobody since the morning."" In the Turkish city of Osmaniye, near the epicentre, pouring rain hampered rescuers as they searched through the rubble looking for survivors. The city was without power as the cold and rain set in. One family camped on the street - despite the freezing temperatures - as they were scared of the aftershocks triggering another building to collapse. Every time they felt an aftershock, the family moved closer into the middle of the street. A hotel owner in the city told the BBC that of 14 guests staying that night, only seven had been found. Countries around the world are sending support to help the rescue efforts, including specialist teams, sniffer dogs and equipment. But the earthquake has caused significant damage to three airports across Turkey, also creating challenges for aid deliveries. At least 1,400 people are now known to have been killed in Syria, where millions of refugees live in camps on the Turkish border.  Following an international appeal for help, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said 45 countries had offered support. UN Secretary General António Guterres called for an international response, saying that many of the families hit by the disaster were ""already in dire need of humanitarian aid in areas where access is a challenge"".  The European Union is sending search and rescue teams to Turkey, while rescuers from the Netherlands and Romania are already on their way. The UK has said it will send 76 specialists, equipment and rescue dogs. France, Germany, Israel and the US have also pledged to help. Russian President Vladimir Putin has offered help to both Turkey and Syria, as has Iran. Turkey lies in one of the world's most active earthquake zones.  In 1999 a quake killed more than 17,000 in the north-west, while in 1939, 33,000 people died in the eastern province of Erzincan. This earthquake was powerful enough to be felt as far away as Cyprus, Lebanon and Israel. Are you in the affected region? If it is safe to do so email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

Turkey earthquake: Aleppo among worst-hit areas in Syria,"Syria's war-torn city of Aleppo is among the areas to have borne the brunt of a deadly earthquake, which also devastated parts of southern Turkey.  More than 1,400 people have been reported dead so far in northern Syria following the quake. Emergency rescue teams said many buildings were damaged or destroyed and that people were trapped under the rubble. The region is home to millions of refugees displaced by the civil war.  Control of northern Syria is divided between the government, Kurdish-led forces and other rebel groups. They remain embroiled in conflict.  Even before the earthquake the situation in much of the region was critical, with freezing weather, crumbling infrastructure and a cholera outbreak causing misery for many of those who live there.  According to separate figures from the Syrian government and the White Helmets rescue group, which operates in rebel-controlled areas, more than 1,400 people have died in the region so far after the earthquake.  A video published on social media, and verified by the BBC, showed a building in Aleppo crashing to the ground as onlookers rushed to safety.  The 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck at 04:17 local time (01:17 GMT) at a depth of 17.9km (11 miles) near the Turkish city of Gaziantep. Twelve hours later, a second quake, which was nearly as large, struck 130km (80 miles) to the north.  Some Aleppo residents told Reuters they have nowhere to go, either because their homes have been destroyed or because they are afraid of further quakes.  A spokesperson for the White Helmets described north-western Syria as a ""disaster area"" and said families remained trapped under the rubble.  One man in the town of Jandairis told AFP news agency he had lost 12 members of his family in the earthquake. Another said some of his relatives were trapped under the rubble. ""We hear their voices, they're still alive, but there's no way to get them out,"" he said. "" There's no one to rescue them. There's no machinery."" In government-controlled areas, all of the country's emergency services have been made available, including the army and student volunteers. However, BBC Monitoring's Hesham Shawish, a Middle East specialist, says this is not enough to deal with the scale of the destruction.  The International Rescue Committee, a charity with more than 1,000 members of staff on the ground in opposition-held areas of Syria, said it was already dealing with the region's first cholera outbreak in a decade and preparing for approaching snowstorms when the quake hit. Freezing conditions and torrential rain were hampering rescue efforts.  Mark Kaye, the organisation's Middle East advocacy director, described the situation as a ""crisis within a crisis within a crisis"" and said vast swathes of the region were beyond contact because of damage to communication networks.  It may also take some time for international aid to arrive. North-western Syria has become one of the hardest places to reach, with only one small crossing on the Turkish border available to transport resources to opposition-held areas. Some people in remote areas are said to have been displaced as many as 20 times due to the civil war, which broke out in 2011 when a peaceful uprising against President Bashar al-Assad turned into violence. Hundreds of thousands of civilians and fighters have been killed in the conflict and the resulting humanitarian crisis has been compounded in recent years by an unprecedented economic downturn. Entire neighbourhoods and vital infrastructure, including hospitals, across Syria were already in ruins as a result of the fighting before the earthquake struck. The government has called for international assistance - appealing specifically to United Nations member states, the International Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian groups.  However, it has reportedly rejected claims that it has asked for Israel's aid. The two countries are still technically at war and don't currently have any diplomatic relations. Dozens of other nations have promised help, including the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar. The UN said it has teams on the ground that are assessing the situation and providing assistance. The BBC's chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, has said that Syria's President, Bashar al-Assad, may be forced to accept help from Western countries and neighbours he has often condemned for backing his enemies.  Russia, which already has a military presence in Syria due to its involvement in the civil war on the government's side, has also pledged its support.

Adani Group: Can embattled India tycoon recover from $100bn loss?,"India's Adani Group has seen its market value plunge after a US investment firm made fraud allegations against it. Can its ambitious growth plans survive?  Until two weeks ago, the ports-to-energy conglomerate which operates seven publicly traded companies had a combined valuation of $220bn.  But since 24 January, when short seller Hindenburg Research accused the group of ""brazen"" stock manipulation and accounting fraud, its valuations have nearly halved. The group's founder Gautam Adani has seen billions wiped off his personal wealth and has dropped out of the list of the world's top 20 richest people. The Adani Group has denied the allegations, calling them ""malicious"" and ""baseless"" and says it plans have not changed. But investors are clearly still nervous.  On Monday, the group said in a statement that it would prepay loans worth $1.1bn, taken using shares as collateral, ahead of their maturity date next year. This, it said, was partly due to ""continued market volatility"" and to assure investors that the group's promoters would ""prepay all shares-backed financing"". Last week, the group also called off its secondary share sale. The 2.5bn (£2bn) it had raised was meant to pay off debt and fund projects, including airport renovation, expressway construction and an ambitious green hydrogen ecosystem. They indicate investors are losing confidence in a company. Analysts are now watching to see how the stock price slide affects the company's operations, cash flow and expansion plans. ""Most of their ambitious projects will have to be heavily scaled back in ambition and timetable, because they will have next to no capacity to raise funds right now,"" says Tim Buckley, director at Climate Energy Finance, a think-tank that works on financial issues related to transition from fossil fuel to clean energy. It could borrow money to fund projects and acquisitions - a common strategy for infrastructure companies, which helped fuel the Adani Group's rapid growth. But the group's debt has grown at a faster pace than revenues and profitability, which some fear could raise risks of a default - a concern flagged by both the Hindenburg report as well as some analysts. The group already has total debt of nearly two trillion rupees ($24bn; £20bn) - it almost doubled over the past three years as Mr Adani's ambitions extended to areas such as 5G and green hydrogen. Nearly two-thirds of Adani's debt is from overseas sources such as bonds or foreign banks, according to a report by global brokerage Jefferies. Until now, the group has mostly raised funds by using its infrastructure assets or shares as collateral. But with stock prices plunging, the value of this collateral has also dipped. The private wealth units of two big banks, Credit Suisse and Citigroup, have stopped accepting Adani bonds as collateral, Bloomberg has reported.  Many Indian banks have also loaned billions of dollars to companies linked to the group and state-owned insurance firm Life Insurance Corporation of India has invested in it. Market observers say that the Hindenburg report and the reaction to it will make lenders cautious - which means loans could become costlier. ""There is pressure on the company's credibility. It will make it extremely difficult to raise fresh loans, especially in the overseas market,"" an Indian corporate banker said on condition of anonymity as he didn't want to be seen commenting on the Adani Group. Another observer, a former banker with an international wealth fund, said that the group may be forced to delay some projects until the issue settles down. He also did not want to be named. The BBC sent a list of questions to the Adani Group. A spokesperson replied: ""All our ongoing projects continue according to the plan. Adani Group's core fundamentals remain unchanged.""  Scrutiny on the group has now increased. Investors and credit rating agencies are closely assessing its ability to raise money and repay loans. S&P Global Ratings has downgraded its outlook on two Adani companies to negative. ""New investigations and negative market sentiment may lead to increased cost of capital and reduce funding access for rated entities,"" it said.   In a video statement after the group's share sale was called off, Mr Adani had said that its balance sheet was ""healthy and assets robust"". He added that the group has an ""impeccable track record of fulfilling our debt obligations"". But credit rating agency ICRA said in a statement last week that the group's large, debt-funded capital spending programme remains a key challenge. Most of the group's capital-guzzling new businesses such as green energy, airports and roads are housed under flagship company Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL) and depend on it for funds. AEL has enough cash but could come under pressure if it has to pay interest for even its subsidiaries. Some of the group's firms will be shielded from the current volatility because they own and operate strong physical assets such as ports, airports and factories. ""Adani Ports and Adani Power are the strongest and most well-capitalised [firms], which means their assets are backed by long-term government contracts. Most of the loans taken by these companies are against these revenue and profit-accruing assets,"" says the corporate banker quoted above. However, this isn't the case for some of the group's newer businesses. Companies such as Adani Gas and renewable energy arm Adani Green already have immense debt on their books and are still building up their cash flows. This could make them more vulnerable to market shocks and reduce their creditworthiness. The banker points out that while the prices of bonds issued by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd have fallen only marginally, those issued by Adani Green had lost more than a quarter of their value in three days. Deferring new projects and selling some assets to raise money could be a way out. ICRA has said that some of the planned capital spending is discretionary in nature and can be deferred, depending on how much liquidity it has. ""The company has built assets that are valuable to a developing country like India, and there will be many strategic investors interested,"" said a corporate adviser who didn't want to be named. Some analysts remain optimistic. ""I have seen varied operating [Adani] projects from ports, airports, cements to renewables which are solid, stable and generating a healthy cash flow. They are completely safe from the ups and downs of what happens in the stock market,"" says Vinayak Chatterjee, an infrastructure expert who is founder and managing trustee of the Infravision Foundation.  Analysts are also watching to see if there will be a regulatory enquiry into the group's corporate governance. The issue has also set off a political row over Mr Adani's perceived closeness to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which both deny.  On Monday, the main opposition Congress party held protests across the country, demanding an investigation into the allegations. Mr Buckley says that as pressure mounts, the Adani Group's ability to win government contracts easily to ramp up revenues will be challenged. It will also find it difficult to restore its credit credibility.  Since the group has to repay a significant amount, it will have to do a strategic asset sale, he says.

Ohio crews release toxic chemicals from derailed train,"Crews are performing a controlled release of toxic chemicals from a derailed train in north-eastern Ohio, hours after ordering residents to evacuate the area or risk death. Officials are releasing vinyl chloride into the air from five derailed rail cars that are at risk of exploding. An evacuation order is in place for anyone within a one-mile (1.6km) radius of the site in East Palestine. Residents were advised to stay away as of 22:00 (03:00 GMT) on Monday. Images from the scene showed huge plumes of black smoke rising into the air shortly after officials said the controlled release would begin. The train, which derailed on Friday, was carrying hazardous material. On Sunday, Governor Mike DeWine said ""a drastic temperature change has taken place in a rail car, and there is now the potential of a catastrophic tanker failure which could cause an explosion with the potential of deadly shrapnel traveling up to a mile"". He asked those who had not yet left to ""immediately evacuate"". Sheriffs went door-to-door to count the remaining residents and urged people within the evacuation area to leave.  ""We will be enforcing the evacuation zone,"" Sheriff Brian McLaughlin of Columbiana County said in a statement. ""Please, for your own safety, remove your families from danger."" Schools and village offices were closed on Monday and businesses within the evacuation zone were not allowed to open. A shelter-in-place order was put into effect for the whole town of East Palestine, which is home to roughly 5,000 people, over concerns about chemicals possibly spilling into the air. Two evacuation stations have opened to provide shelter to residents. Officials from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said there were 20 rail cars carrying hazardous material on the train. Ten of them derailed about 15 miles south of Youngstown, Ohio.  Five of the derailed cars were carrying the chemical vinyl chloride, a type of gas.  Exposure to vinyl chloride has been associated with heightened risks of certain forms of cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute - but state environmental officials said harmful levels had not been detected in the community. It is not yet known why the Norfolk Southern train, which was carrying 100-plus cars, derailed. It departed from Madison, Illinois, and was bound for Conway, Pennsylvania when it came off the tracks, according to the NTSB. Officials said it would take four to six weeks for the NTSB to produce a preliminary report on the accident.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64540530
US school apologises for 'inexcusably insensitive' Black History Month lunch,"A New York school has apologised after serving what it called an ""inexcusably insensitive"" lunch on the first day of Black History Month. Students at Nyack Middle School were served fried chicken, waffles and watermelon on 1 February. The foods have been used as racist tropes against African Americans.  Officials from the school said its food supplier - Aramark - had changed the planned meal of cheesesteaks, broccoli and fruit. ""We are extremely disappointed by this regrettable situation and apologise to the entire Nyack community for the cultural insensitivity displayed by our food service provider,"" Principal David Johnson wrote in a 2 February letter to parents. The foods the supplier picked ""reinforce negative stereotypes concerning the African American community"", he said.  Honore Santiago, a student at the school, said she was surprised when she saw the meal in her cafeteria. ""They were asking people if they want watermelon and I remember being confused because it's not in season,"" the sixth-grade student told local news outlet WABC.  She said she told her mother when she got home and both were angered by the lunch. ""I just hope that they won't do it again, at a different school or my school,"" she told the BBC's US partner CBS News.  School food vendor Aramark apologised for the incident, which it called an ""inexcusable mistake"" that ""never should have happened"". The food vendor has sparked a backlash over meal choices in the past. In 2018, New York University severed ties with the company after a Black History Month lunch it offered at the university included red Kool-Aid and watermelon-flavoured water as well as other foods that have been used as racist tropes. And in 2011, the food vendor served fried chicken and waffles to students at the University of California on Martin Luther King Jr Day. Watermelon became a racist stereotype during the Jim Crow era in the US, according to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. The fruit was once a symbol of self-sufficiency among southern African Americans who grew and sold watermelons after emancipation, but it was later used as a disparaging symbol.

'Surprise' in Canada as NYC buses migrants to border,"An immigration official in the Canadian province of Quebec has said it is ""surprising"" to learn that New York City is sending migrants to the country's border. New York City mayor Eric Adams told Fox 5 that his administration was assisting migrants who had been sent to his city but wanted to go elsewhere. ""Some want to go to Canada, some want to go to warmer states, and we are there for them as they continue to move on with their pursuit of this dream,"" Mr Adams said. The New York Post has reported that migrants in New York City are being given free bus tickets to Plattsburgh, New York state, about 20 miles (32km) south of the Canadian border. From there, they pay taxis and shuttles to take them to Quebec.  Quebec immigration minister Christine Fréchette told reporters in Montreal that the development was ""surprising"". She said it highlighted the need to ""solve the problem of Roxham Road"", referring to an unofficial border crossing south of Montreal used by thousands of asylum seekers every year. ""I think it makes the urgency of the situation even more apparent,"" Ms Fréchette said, adding that Canada and the US were negotiating to update the Safe Third Country Agreement. The treaty, signed in 2002, requires migrants to make an asylum claim in the first country they enter, whether it is the US or Canada.  But it only applies at official border crossings, which Roxham Road is not. This loophole allows the migrants arriving from New York to have their asylum cases heard by Canadian immigration authorities. New York City has an ongoing migrant crisis, as states on the southern US border bus newly arrived migrants to America's most populous city. In a January visit to Texas, Mayor Adams told reporters there was ""no room in New York"" for the migrants.  Days before, he had released a statement saying his city had welcomed 40,000 asylum seekers since last spring, providing them with food, shelter and other resources.  ""We are at our breaking point,"" the statement read. ""Based off our projections, we anticipate being unable to continue sheltering arriving asylum seekers on our own and have submitted an emergency mutual aid request to the State of New York."" Mr Adams confirmed to Fox 5 on Monday that the city was providing free bus tickets for migrants. ""If they are seeking to go somewhere else, we are helping in the reticketing process,"" he said.

Anthony Lowe: New video released in police killing of double amputee,"Authorities have released new video and audio captured moments before the death of a double amputee, who was shot by police last month near Los Angeles. Anthony Lowe, 36, who was black, was fatally shot by police after allegedly refusing to drop a butcher's knife.  The videos show Mr Lowe attacking a man with the knife before police arrived on scene, and officers shooting Mr Lowe as he attempted to flee. Officers involved in Mr Lowe's death have since been placed on leave. Mr Lowe's family earlier said they would file a lawsuit against the city of Huntington Park, alleging wrongful death and civil rights violations.  They said he did not pose a threat to police because of his condition and was undergoing a mental health crisis when he was killed on 26 January. Police officers in Huntington Park, where the shooting took place, do not wear body cameras. Mr Lowe's family had called on police to release footage of the shooting from nearby surveillance cameras.  In a news conference on Monday, the Huntington Park Police Department played two surveillance videos of the incident. They also played police dispatch audio and a recording of the initial 911 call in which a victim reported being stabbed by a suspect described as a black man in a wheelchair.  One of the videos showed Mr Lowe attacking a man with a knife at an intersection. The other showed police officers engage with Mr Lowe, who then attempted to flee while wielding the knife. The officers then chased Mr Lowe and pointed their guns at him. He is then seen dropping to the ground, surrounded by three officers with their guns still drawn towards him. Mr Lowe was reportedly shot nearly a dozen times.  In response to the release of the footage, a lawyer for Mr Lowe's family renewed demands for accountability. ""There is absolutely no reason to shoot a double amputee in the back 11 times, who was hobbling away from officers,"" Annee Della Donna said. Mr Lowe's mother, Dorothy, added that Mr Lowe had struggled after losing his legs five months ago. ""I wouldn't wish this feeling for no mother to bear, to see this video and get no answers from the justice system,"" she said.  Police Chief Cosme Lozano did not answer questions from reporters during Monday's news conference. He said the footage was released with ""the goal of advancing full disclosure and transparency of the events that transpired from beginning to end"". The shooting is now being investigated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's office, Chief Lozano said, and the officers involved will remain on leave pending the results of that investigation. Those officers have not been named. In a statement released four days after the shooting, police said Mr Lowe was a suspect in an attack that left a victim with ""a life-threatening stab wound resulting in a collapsed lung and internal bleeding"". Police later said the victim was in a stable condition. They added that Mr Lowe ""ignored the officer's verbal commands and threatened to advance or throw the knife at officers"". Police say that after two unsuccessful attempts to use tasers to subdue Mr Lowe, they shot him. The case comes amid renewed scrutiny of police killings in the US after the death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee. According to the Mapping Police Violence database, nearly 1,200 people were killed by police in 2022. Officers were charged with a crime in nine of these cases.

When a Canadian weather balloon went rogue,"Twenty-five years later, Dale Sommerfeldt can laugh about the rogue weather balloon that resisted the firepower of air forces from three nations trying to bring it down.  But he admits at the time it was a headache for those involved. In 1998, a technical malfunction meant the research balloon had failed to come down as planned, in two or three days' time.  Instead, it began to drift across Canada towards the Atlantic Ocean.  Mr Sommerfeldt, who works for the Canadian engineering firm Scientific Instrumentation Ltd, which built the instrumentation for the balloon, said it had been meant for ""strictly scientific research"" related to ozone.  The Canadian balloon was a different style from the Chinese balloon shot down over the weekend by the US, he added, noting that ""those are intended to stay up for weeks or even a month at a time.""  It was a massive thing - the size of a 25-storey building that would cover an area equivalent to five football pitches if deflated, according to a BBC report from the time.  The helium-filled balloon was launched from the province of Saskatchewan in late August of 1998, to conduct research for the Canadian Space Agency, Environment Canada and the University of Denver in the US.  But the researchers quickly realised something had gone wrong. A valve that would allow the balloon to naturally release gas and deflate over time had ended up covered by a piece of plastic.  It was not long before they had lost control of it.  ""The termination device failed and the backup system failed and that's why the balloon is where it is right now,″ Mr Sommerfeldt told the Associated Press news agency in 1998. On Monday he told the BBC: ""It was just subject to whatever the winds were."" An attempt to bring it down was made off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, but to no avail.  ""We asked the Canadian military if they would consider shooting it down, sending somebody out for target practice,"" Mr Sommerfeldt said.  A fighter jet had a ceiling of about 60,000 feet, he recalled and ""the balloon, of course, was a lot higher than that"".  Hoping to save the research, he asked them to shoot upwards and aim for the suspension point, where the release mechanism was for the package of scientific instruments, which were attached to a parachute.  According to news reports from the time, the Canadian CF-18s fired more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition at the balloon - the pilots refrained from using air-to-air missiles.  The volleys of ammo did not work. ""It wasn't enough to shake loose the release mechanism. They probably hit the balloon too. But those small bullet holes and a balloon that size would have almost no effect,"" Mr Sommerfeldt said.  It was also shadowed by British and US fighter jets. The rogue balloon continued on towards Iceland before drifting into Russian airspace.  It then drifted back towards Norway before finally landing on Finland's Mariehamn Island after what the Tribune News Service dubbed a ""nine-day odyssey"".  The instrumentation was sent back to Canada and reused (though there were some bullet holes on the instrument package and its parachute). Mr Sommerfeldt said. There was, he added, a slap on the wrist from Nav Canada, the country's air traffic regulator, which had to reroute transatlantic flights around the balloon route.  ""It's a while ago, so I'm kind of past it now,"" he said. ""But I suspect it was a bit stressful at the time."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64546767
"South Africa's power cuts hit vineyards: No power, no pinot","South Africans are struggling with crippling power cuts on a daily basis, which are imposing huge costs on business. As the country's grape harvest gets under way, there are fears about the impact on the wine industry. The rumble of tractors, the churning of the wine press and occasional bouts of laughter from the farm workers provide the soundtrack to the busiest time of the year for the Groote Post vineyard. Everyone is active as the picking and processing of the grapes begin at this winery in the picturesque town of Darling, less than 80km (50 miles) from Cape Town, in the west of the country. Bunches of dark pinot noir grapes lie in wooden pallets stacked next to the wine press. A fork-lift truck tips a pallet into the press, releasing a sweet odour into the air. I taste a grape, which is smaller than the supermarket varieties, and much sweeter and full of robust flavour.    ""In 16 months from now these grapes will be in your glass and you'll be sipping on some lovely bubbly,"" Peter Pentz, Groote Post communications manager says.    And while that may be true, the winemaker will be having a harder time getting it on to tables in South Africa. The difficulty for every firm in the industry is that this crucial time of year coincides with the worst rolling power blackouts the country has ever experienced.  Not a day has gone by in 2023 without the electricity from the state-run power company Eskom going down. The interrupted power supply is having a big effect on those hoping to make wine.   ""As soon as the power cuts, it means that [without a generator] none of the operation can continue within the cellar,"" Mr Pentz tells the BBC. ""No labelling can continue, no bottling and [no] cooling. Especially in the harvesting season it's vital for us to get the fermentation process started.""  This vineyard, like many others in the region, has been forced to invest in a back-up generator, but the exorbitant price of diesel is driving up costs and making it hard for small and medium-sized wineries to survive.  Groote Post is spending around 50,000 rand ($2,800; £2,400) per month on diesel for its generator and the farm still has to spend more on fuel for its tractors. This is representative of the extra costs facing an industry which has big ambitions to grow.     South Africa is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, generating about $3bn in revenue every year. Around half of the wine made in the country is exported to overseas markets, with UK drinkers being the largest consumers of South African wine.  Many wineries are exploring opportunities in Asia - exports to China, for example, have seen double-digit growth in recent years. But the constant power cuts are slashing growth forecasts.  The impact is being felt across all sectors of the economy. According to global accounting firm PwC, the South African economy could havegrown by around 7% - instead of less than 2% - last year were it not for ""load shedding"", as the power cuts are known locally. ""This is challenging for us, in fact this is a crisis for us,"" says Christo Conradie, manager of wine business at Vinpro, which represents nearly 2,600 wine producers and sellers.    ""Power is important for our producers because we need to irrigate, specifically at this time of the season we are looking at the ripening of the berries. ""That's why we need to have it [power] and now we are sitting with Eskom that can't supply at an optimal level,"" Mr Conradie adds. Though South Africa's power crisis is not new, the problems seem to be getting worse. The country has a fleet of old and inefficient coal-fired power stations that are constantly breaking down. There are two new power stations, but they are not up and running yet and are massively over-budget. Eskom is expected to impose load shedding on a continuous basis for the next two years while it works on a plan to extricate the country from the crisis. The wine industry is not being passive in its criticism of load shedding. Representatives are talking with the government and have put proposals on the table.  Mr Conradie says they have drawn up a timetable of when the winemakers need power most - usually in the early hours of the morning and just after lunch - and have asked for the blackouts to be scheduled around them.  The industry is also seeking rebates for diesel fuel and for the government to remove red tape so there can be more investment in solar and other alternative sources of power.  Load shedding during the harvest season will exacerbate the situation for battered winemakers which have been lurching from one crisis to another.    The wine industry was just starting to make a comeback following a tough period during the Covid-19 pandemic. Alcohol sales were banned in South Africa during the height of the health emergency and domestic wine sales dropped by 20%.  This year's crop is set to be smaller than that of 2022 due to unfavourable weather conditions earlier in the season.   To try and alleviate some of the pressures, the department of agriculture last month set up a task team to monitor the impact of load shedding.    ""Technical work to measure financial costs is under way and will help to underline the strategy,"" says department spokesperson Reggie Ngcobo.   But when that strategy emerges is hard to know. Nevertheless, back at the Groote Post vineyard, work continues despite the challenges. There is a resilience and defiant optimism. Mr Pentz is proud of the wines they produce and the way that they can touch different parts of the world. Holding up a fat bunch of grapes he says proudly: ""It's amazing to think that we start off from this, and we end up with someone, somewhere in the world, sipping on some grapes coming from South Africa.""

Trial of scrapping train return tickets extended,"A trial of scrapping return tickets in a bid to make fares simpler will be extended as part of a shake-up of the country's railways. Transport Secretary Mark Harper will confirm on Tuesday that publicly-owned LNER will extend its trial of selling single tickets only on its routes. Under the trial, a single is always half the cost of a return. Currently, many singles are £1 less than a return. The government said such reforms could provide ""better value"" for passengers. LNER operates trains between London and Peterborough, the East Midlands, Leeds and York, through to Newcastle, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow.  It has not been revealed if there are plans to roll out the trial at LNER to the country's other train operators. As an example, LNER said when its trial first began in 2020 that the cost of a super off-peak ticket single from London to Edinburgh would be £73.70 rather than £146.40 or £147.40 for a super off-peak return. Railway expert Mark Smith said the reforms created a ""simple all-one-way fares structure designed for easy sale through today's channels: Internet, ticket machines and contactless"". He said the current ticket system ""penalises"" people making open-jaw or circular journeys rather than straightforward returns.   In a speech, Mr Harper will outline how a new organisation, Great British Railways (GBR), will work.  In 2021, the government announced plans for GBR to replace an ""overcomplicated and fragmented"" system as well as set timetables and prices, sell tickets in England and manage rail infrastructure. There were fears the plans might not survive the recent changes in prime ministers, but Mr Harper is to explain how it will work with the private sector as ""a guiding mind to co-ordinate the entire network"". He will also announce plans to roll out pay-as-you-go ticketing across the South East, which will enable travellers to pay for journeys by tapping in and out with contactless cards or phones - similar to London's Oyster system.  ""The industry's road to recovery after Covid has been tough, with reform badly needed to win back that lost passenger revenue while putting customers first,"" Mr Harper said ahead of his speech. The transport's secretary's announcements comes at a time when Britain's railways are being disrupted by strike action. Rail workers and train drivers have staged a series of walk outs in recent months over disputes involving pay and working practices.  Union bosses are calling for pay increases in line with the rising cost of living, but train companies have said any pay rises need to go alongside reforms, with the Covid pandemic leaving a hole in industry's finances. Louise Haigh, Labour's shadow transport secretary, said regardless of the ticket people buy, ""passengers are paying more for less under the Conservative's broken rail system"". ""Thirteen years of failure has seen fares soar, more services than ever cancelled, while failing operators continue to be handed millions in taxpayers' cash,"" she added. Regulated rail fares in England are set to rise by up to 5.9% from March. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64548794
Five things about Scottish politicians' tax returns,"Nicola Sturgeon has published her tax returns for the years since she became Scotland's first minister, and has urged other politicians including PM Rishi Sunak to follow. With Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross also releasing his financial documents, what have we learned? The paperwork for Nicola Sturgeon shows she has one regular source of income - her role as an MSP and first minister. That paid her just over £140,000 in 2021-22, and she paid just over £51,500 in income tax. The salary for MSPs has gone up over the years, meaning Ms Sturgeon's pay has ticked up slightly too. But Scottish ministers agreed to effectively freeze their additional pay since 2008-9, back in the early days of the SNP taking power at Holyrood. They are still taxed on the full amount, but send an extra chunk back to the Scottish government for public spending so that their take-home ministerial pay remains at the level it was 15 years ago. The SNP said Ms Sturgeon ""donates around 20% of her salary entitlement back to the public purse"". There has been much debate about Ms Sturgeon's future in recent years, and what she might contemplate doing with her life after politics. These returns show she has been putting plenty aside, having paid large sums into her pension fund each year.  In 2021-22 that came to £58,331, and in 2015-16 Ms Sturgeon paid more than £93,000 into savings with the Scottish Public Pensions Agency. That incurs a tax bill in itself, given the annual tax-free allowance for pension contributions is £40,000. Ms Sturgeon's most recent return noted that the savings tax charge of £7,991 was being ""met by the Scottish Parliamentary Pension Scheme"". The SNP published Ms Sturgeon's tax returns on Monday morning, shortly before a Q&A session with the media. However, by the time the session started, the documents had been taken down again - because they had inadvertently failed to redact some of the first minister's personal information. One of the documents had failed to blank out details including her Bank of Scotland account number and the tax reference of her pension scheme. The papers reappeared a short time later with the offending information scrubbed out. There are two reasons why Ms Sturgeon has published her tax return. The first is fairly simple - because she was asked to. She first published her returns in 2016, in the wake of the Panama Papers revelations, and was recently reminded of her commitment to do so on an annual basis by the media. The second is more political. She wanted to put pressure on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to publish his returns, which may be somewhat more complex than her own. At her Q&A on Monday, the first minister also called for the Conservative and Labour leaders at Holyrood to publish their tax information. However, she was decidedly less happy to talk about the finances of another SNP figure - her husband Peter Murrell. As chief executive of the SNP, Mr Murrell made a loan of £107,000 to the party in 2021 to help with ""cash flow"" following a Holyrood election campaign. Ms Sturgeon said she could not recall when she first found out about the loan, and insisted that ""what he does with his resources is a matter for him"". In response to a challenge from Ms Sturgeon, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross published his tax return later on Monday. It details his earnings as both an MP and an MSP. His MP salary was £72,821, but he was paid a much-reduced rate for his Holyrood role - at £17,223 - on account of his dual mandate. He donates his MSP salary in full to charity.  Mr Ross also has a sideline on the sidelines as a football referee, having acted as a linesman at matches from Scotland to the Champions League. His tax returns include a business section for ""referee services"" - although no earnings have been logged, given Mr Ross was out injured last year.

Energy support scheme: Final batch of £600 vouchers in the post,"The final batch of the 500,000 energy support vouchers for Northern Ireland households has been sent, the Post Office has confirmed. The scheme, which began on 2 January, has been completed weeks ahead of its original end-of-February target. About 80% of the £600 vouchers, which were given to keypad and non-direct debit customers, have been redeemed. The last tranche of vouchers have been posted and are expected to arrive with households by the weekend. Customers who pay their electricity bills by direct debit have been receiving the £600 as a bank transfer. Those who have received vouchers can redeem them for cash at a Post Office branch. On Sunday the government said it expected all eligible households to receive their payment, either by direct debit or as a voucher, by the end of this week. Customers will need to bring: Keypad customers will also need to bring their top-up card or app. If customers bank with Monzo, Nationwide or a credit union they will not be able to transfer the voucher into their account at the Post Office and will need to bring photo ID, as detailed in the voucher, to receive the payment as cash. For those physically unable to go to the Post Office, details about how someone else can collect the payment on your behalf are in the letter. Post Office chief executive Nick Read said the success of the rollout demonstrates the significant role post offices play in communities. ""We are pleased with the incredible progress of the voucher rollout with 80% of the total vouchers having already been redeemed within just three weeks of starting the mailouts,"" he said. The £600 payments are to help homes across Northern Ireland struggling with the cost-of-living crisis. An initial £400 support was announced last May and a further £200 was later added due to the high proportion of homes in Northern Ireland that use home heating oil. The payment was given to all households regardless of whether they use oil. Households in Great Britain have been receiving similar support in monthly instalments since October. But the lump sum nature of the scheme in Northern Ireland means households in the region will get the full support ahead of households in Great Britain. The vouchers can be redeemed until the end of March but Energy Minister Graham Stuart has urged those who receive one to cash it in as soon as possible. ""It has gone more quickly and smoothly than we could have imagined and is making a real difference to people struggling with their bills,"" he added.

Conwy: Farmers and livestock struggling with water supply,"Farmers with water supply issues say their daily life and ability to care for livestock is becoming ""impossible"". For the past fortnight some people in the Ysbyty Ifan area, near Betws y Coed, Conwy, have been left with no supply at times or low water pressure. Dafydd Peredur Jones, from FUW farming Union in the Conway Valley, said farmers were struggling to contact the water company. Welsh Water says it is carrying out investigations on the network. It said it found and repaired a burst water pipe in the area, however it is aware there is still an issue on the network which has resulted in low water pressure in ""a couple of the higher properties"". Dafydd Peredur Jones, an officer with the FUW farming union, said: ""We have two or three farms here where the water is not sufficient, the pressure is very very low, it's just trickling into the farm and the farmhouse. ""There's livestock on these farms - they are housed so it's vital that there is ample water there for the livestock. ""As for the farmers themselves and the families are struggling because of low pressure,"" he added. ""They can't have showers and wash their clothes... it's impossible.""

Farming: Co-op finds ways to make farming greener,"A co-operative that sells food to local families could help form a template to make farming in Wales greener. Tyddyn Teg, near Caernarfon, in Gwynedd, grows organic veg for the community and tries to be environmentally friendly. It does not use pesticides, which it says helps biodiversity to thrive.  It comes as a new bill is to be debated by the Welsh government on Tuesday that could transform how farming operates in Wales. Each week Tyddyn Teg sells 170 boxes of food to local families.  The farm shop sells homemade bread and food from other producers. The farm's Sally Mees said it was useful for people to know where their food had come from.   The 44-year-old said: ""The customers, they can see we're harvesting vegetables straight out of the ground into the shop."" Ms Mees, who manages the plant nursery, said only a small part of the land was farmed. ""The rest of it is wetland, woodland, and it's teeming with life,"" she said. The co-op's Aglaé Bindi, 31 and originally from France, manages the accounts and shop. Reducing the use of machines and using more people to farm, she said, was ""a big challenge"".  ""We have to be careful where we're spending, and we actually sometimes financially struggle a little bit,"" the mum-of-one said. ""To answer these challenges we have to have more of these places, so I think encouraging them is a good thing, but it starts with acknowledging that the ones doing it at the moment are struggling.  Before Brexit, farming policy was decided in Brussels under the Common Agricultural Policy.   It rewarded landowners for the amount of land they had, regardless of how it was farmed.   The new Agriculture Bill, the first designed specifically to meet Wales' needs, could herald a change in the way Wales is farmed - with more emphasis on farming sustainably rather than on maximising food production. Currently the bill wants farmers to ""maintain and enhance"" the environment and biodiversity to qualify for subsidies. The World Wide Fund for Nature Cymru (WWF) wants the Welsh government to go further. WWF Cymru said the bill should aim to ""restore"" the natural environment, in line with the ambitions of last year's COP15 conference in Montreal. WWF Cymru's Alex Phillips said: ""The time has come to include that directly in Welsh legislation to make sure that this new act is as strong as possible."" Farming unions said environmental sustainability was dependent on economic sustainability.  Fourth generation hill farmer Rhodri Jones farms native breeds of cows and sheep in Llanuwchllyn, in Gwynedd. For 30 years his farm, called Brynllech, has been involved in environmental projects. The latest is Glastir, a Welsh government scheme that reimburses farmers for farming less intensively.   A mountain on the farm is not grazed as it's an area of scientific special interest and the hedges are wide to encourage birds. ""There's a lot of work that's gone into these environmental schemes and we want to continue to do that and enhance what's here,"" Mr Jones, 45, said. But sustainability and viability, he said, go hand in hand.  ""We are committed to the net-zero policy but at the end of the day we have to continue to produce the wonderful food we produce for the country,"" Mr Jones said. ""It has to be sustainable environmentally and financially.   ""Otherwise, we won't be here and there'll be nobody here to look after what we've got."" Funding from Glastir is to cease at the end of this year but the new Sustainable Farming Scheme, part of the Agriculture Bill, is not due to come into effect until spring 2025. NFU Cymru warned work carried out over three decades was at risk because the Welsh government had not committed to extending Glastir until then. Chairman of its rural affairs board, Hedd Pugh, said: ""(Farmers) could be forced to put more stock back on the mountains, or to open up the gates around areas where trees have been planted. ""The farms have got to be viable, and it is so important the Welsh government realise that. There must be a payment and the Glastir scheme (should carry) on until the new scheme starts in 2025."" The Welsh government said: ""Our first ever Welsh Agriculture Bill paves the way for ambitious and transformational legislation to support farmers, sustainable food production, and to conserve and enhance the Welsh countryside, culture and language. ""One of the objectives of the Bill is to maintain and enhance the resilience of ecosystems and the benefits they provide. This aligns with the objective of the Environment (Wales) Act.""  It said Glastir would continue to December 2023 and future support of the scheme was being considered. Stability payments, it said, would be a feature of the Sustainable Farming Scheme throughout and beyond the current Senedd term. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64543934
New delay in transfer of welfare benefits role to Scotland,"The UK government could be delivering disability living allowance and some other benefits in Scotland for another three years until 2026.  Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride has written to the Scottish government to extend transitional arrangements. New devolved powers in 2016 gave the Scottish Parliament responsibility for £2.8bn of social security expenditure. The Scottish government said it was ""always a joint programme of delivery"" between both governments.  In the letter - seen by the BBC - to Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison, Mr Stride warned there should be ""no further slippage"" in the timetable for transferring benefits operations.  He wrote: ""Any changes to this plan, including unexpected delays or the introduction of additional requirements or benefits into the timetable would create significant delivery risks"".  A package of benefits was devolved through the Scotland Act 2016 in an agreement to increase Holyrood's powers after the 2014 independence referendum.  Scottish ministers hoped to take over delivery of these benefits in 2020, but this commitment was dropped during the Covid pandemic.  Following recent talks, the UK Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) agreed to keep delivering disability living allowance to some people in Scotland until March 2026.  The extension also applies to attendance allowance, severe disablement allowance and payments for industrial injuries.  Further arrangements will extend the DWP's ability to provide the personal independence payment and carers allowance in Scotland until March 2025.  The DWP said it was also prepared to make winter fuel payments in Scotland in 2023-24 if required.  Opposition parties have repeatedly criticised the Scottish government for the pace of progress in establishing the Scottish welfare system.  A new agency, Social Security Scotland, has taken over delivering some benefits - including best start grants for babies and help with funeral payments.  It is also responsible for new benefits that do not exist in other parts of the UK, including the Scottish child payment.  The agency has begun transferring clients who receive disability living allowance over to the new Scottish child/adult disability payment but it is not clear how long this process will take.  Labour MSP Pam Duncan-Glancy said: ""The relationship between Scotland's two governments has descended into chaos once again, leaving the SNP's promise to deliver a fairer, functioning Scottish social security system in tatters. ""Every day that this programme is delayed is another day that disabled people and carers are left at the mercy of a Tory-run DWP"".  Conservative MSP Miles Briggs said: ""It is concerning that we are yet again seeing DWP and UK ministers having to provide contingencies and extensions to agency agreements to help support the ongoing delivery of welfare payments in Scotland.    ""Promises made by SNP ministers around the establishment capabilities of Social Security Scotland have come and gone"".  The Scottish government said it would set out the timetable for the delivery of future benefits to the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday. A spokesperson said: ""This is and has always been a joint programme of delivery between both governments.  ""The Scottish government has worked with the UK government to ensure that plans for the transfer of benefits were deliverable both for the UK government and the Scottish government.  ""Both governments needed to pause some work to respond to the pandemic, so the original programme of work needed to be replanned.  ""Despite the pandemic, we are now delivering 12 Scottish government social security benefits to one million people, seven of which are entirely new forms of financial support which are only available only in Scotland including the Scottish Child Payment.""

LGBTQ: Plan to make it easier to change gender in Wales,"Making it simpler for someone to legally change their gender is part of new proposals being unveiled by the Welsh government. It comes after the UK government said it would block similar legislation put forward by the Scottish government. The Welsh government called the new LGBTQ+ Action Plan for Wales an ""ambitious plan with hope at its heart"". The UK government has been asked to comment. The plan, which aims to improve the rights of LGBTQ+ people, also includes banning all aspects of so-called conversion therapy practices. Stonewall Cymru welcomed the proposals, but said ""we shouldn't be complacent"". The document, which has been backed by Plaid Cymru, says it would ""trigger"" a request with the UK government to devolve powers related to gender recognition. Last month, the UK government said it would block legislation put forward by the Scottish government that would make it easier for people in the country to change their legally recognised gender. It said the draft law would conflict with equality protections applying across Great Britain. The Scottish government wanted to speed up and simplify the existing process by which people can obtain a gender recognition certificate - the legal recognition of a transgender person's ""acquired"" gender. Currently, people have to apply to a UK gender recognition panel and typically must present a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. Last month, First Minister Mark Drakeford said in the Senedd that Wales should have a gender self-identification system, similar to the one approved in Scotland. Under the plan, the Welsh government would ""initiate conversations"" with the UK government to implement a recognition for non-binary people on passports and driving licences. Ethan Thomas, 21, has a transgender sister and described the new plan as ""pretty cool"". ""It's good that Wales is pushing to include people and stop prejudice against them,"" he said. Student Lili Rainer, 21, said the plans boost her Welsh pride.  ""I love being from Wales. It's really good to see Wales stepping forward and stepping up,"" she said. ""I think it gets people talking about it and makes it more normalised."" Tabitha Edwards, 20, added that while she thinks it was a positive step, more can be done. ""I'm bisexual. I came out when I was about 13,"" she said. ""It makes me very happy, but I think there could be more being done."" Cai Jones, 22, agreed, adding: ""I think it's the government's duty. If they're going to announce these plans, they need to fulfil these plans. They need to actually back it up. ""I think there's still a long way to go, definitely."" The Welsh government would also use ""all available powers to ban all aspects"" of so-called conversion therapy practices, which refers to any form of treatment or psychotherapy aiming to change a person's sexual orientation or to suppress a person's gender identity, and ""seek the devolution of any necessary additional powers"". The UK government has said it will ban all forms of conversion therapy in England and Wales - including those targeting transgender people. In the education sector, the action plan sets out to provide national trans guidance for schools and local authorities in Wales. The plan, according to the document, would ensure maternity and fertility services are accessible and straightforward to use for LGBTQ+ people by ""reviewing and improving"" fertility referral pathways. Deputy minister for social partnership Hannah Blythyn said: ""The plan is ambitious but with hope at its heart. ""We are absolutely committed to meaningful change for LGBTQ+ communities, creating a society and country where LGBTQ+ people are safe to live and love authentically, openly and freely as ourselves."" Davinia Green, director of Stonewall Cymru, said it was a ""first step"". ""What I'm really keen for, is for people not to become complacent by this,"" she said. ""An action plan is great, there's some really key and clear commitments as part of it, but we want to see it implemented."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price added: ""This means delivering change for everyone in society and we are proud to be working with the Welsh government on our shared ambition for Wales to be the most LGBTQ+ friendly nation in Europe.  ""This plan shows our concrete commitment to delivering that.""  Additional reporting by Emilia Davies, BBC News. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64548844
World War Two sailor feared dead in torpedo attack turns 100,"A Royal Navy sailor who was reported dead during World War Two has celebrated his 100th birthday. Morrell Murphy, from Lisburn, was on board HMS Capel when it was torpedoed by a German submarine in 1944. Four days after the attack his family was informed that Mr Murphy had been killed. The family even received a letter of sympathy from King George VI but soon afterwards Morrell turned up fit and well at the family home. He is now living in County Down and his granddaughter Jennifer organised a party to mark his 100th birthday. ""It's hard to believe that I'm now 100,"" he told BBC News NI. ""Hard to believe that I've survived all these years but I still enjoy life."" Morrell joined the Royal Navy on St Patrick's Day 1942, aged 19, as World War Two was raging. In December 1944 he survived a German attack in the English Channel which killed more than 70 of his fellow crew members on HMS Capel. He was saved by the American navy and taken to France to recover. It meant the British authorities did not realise he was still alive. When he arrived unannounced at his parents' home the following month there was disbelief. ""There were tears of joy when they opened the door and found out it was me,"" he said. ""I remember my sister running over to a telephone kiosk to tell my cousins and my uncle and aunt that I was alright."" For many years he did not like to talk about the torpedo attack on HMS Capel but he recently went into detail about it on the Royal Navy website. ""I was blasted clear of the deck with my clothes ripped to pieces and my boots blown off,"" he said. ""When I hit the sea and came to my senses I managed to swim to a life raft and climb aboard to join another six or seven survivors. ""After a long two hours I was picked up by an American motor torpedo boat and taken to Cherbourg Harbour and then on to the American field hospital about three miles away. ""Nobody registered my name, rank or ship. After a cursory examination for hypothermia and some food I was discharged the next morning. ""No fresh clothes were offered and I walked barefoot back to the harbour wearing an oil-stained jersey. ""Unknown to me a priority telegram dated 30 December 1944 had been sent to my mother in Lisburn but was opened by my father. ""It read: 'Deeply regret to inform you that your son H M Murphy has been reported missing presumed killed on war service.'"" In spite of his near-death experience Morrell returned to the navy until the end of the war. He then had a career in the civil service before his retirement. On his 100th birthday he received a card from King Charles III, congratulating him on reaching the milestone. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64548304
"Cost-of-living: Welsh ministers' help not enough, report says","Cost of living policies from the Welsh government do not offer enough help to people facing hardship, a Senedd committee has said. It criticised a cut in fuel payments and said a top-up in funding for sixth-form and college students was overdue. Senedd members will debate the Welsh government's £20bn spending plans for the next financial year on Tuesday. The Welsh government said the key levers for tackling poverty lie with the UK government. The Conservatives accused Labour ministers of making real terms cuts to health, social services and education in their budget. Meanwhile, Plaid Cymru has called for income tax rises to help fund pay rises in the NHS and social care. The report by the cross-party finance committee looks at Labour ministers' latest Welsh government budget. Every year, ministers in Cardiff set out how they will divide funding from the UK government and tax between the NHS, councils, education and other Welsh public services. ""We see little in this draft budget to prevent households falling into hardship,"" the committee said. It also said it is disappointed warm home payments of £200 for people on benefits will stop later this year. About 166,000 households benefitted from the £90m Winter Fuel Support scheme, but ministers say they cannot afford to keep it. The committee also calls for an increase in the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) for 16 to 18-year-olds. The weekly payment has been kept at £30 since the mid-2000s. A review of the household income that qualifies students for EMA, which last changed in 2012, was ""long overdue and should be undertaken urgently"", it added. High inflation has reduced the value of the Welsh government's £20bn budget, with ministers warning they will not be able to deliver as much as they hoped. But the committee says there is not enough detail about cuts, and it calls for a full assessment on the impact of inflation. Committee chairman Peredur Owen Griffiths said: ""We understand that the funding decisions facing the Welsh government are extraordinarily tough, but we were surprised and worried at the lack of candour in the draft budget. ""This is not the right way to deal with our committee and the Senedd generally, and undermines legitimate democratic scrutiny."" In the budget, Welsh government ruled out using its powers to change income tax. Finance Minister Rebecca Evans has said she thought ""long and hard"" about whether to put up income tax, but decided it ""didn't feel like the right time to be taxing people more"". Explaining her decision to the committee, she said there was a danger of high earners moving out of Wales to avoid a tax hike. But the absence of a full analysis of this ""suggests that the minister had not seriously considered changing tax rates"", the committee says. Tuesday's debate comes during negotiations between the Welsh government and unions over pay. Most health unions have suspended strikes while they consult members on an improved pay offer from the government. But Ms Evans has said extra cash found to make a better pay offer to NHS staff means the Welsh government will have ""more difficult choices"" to make in future years. The government is expected to win a Senedd vote on the budget on Tuesday, with Plaid Cymru abstaining on the spending plans as part of its co-operation agreement with Labour. Plaid has tabled an amendment calling for increases to income tax to pay for NHS and social care pay rises. It does not have enough votes to get its own proposals through the Senedd alone and they are unlikely to pass. The Conservatives said they had an ""action plan"" that would put people's priorities at the heart of the Welsh government budget, which included care hotels to clear hospital backlogs, surgical hubs and freezing council tax. Shadow Finance Minister Peter Fox said: ""The Welsh government receives £1.20 for every £1 spent in England, yet Labour have consistently failed to address the people's priorities. Waiting lists are the longest in the UK, the Welsh economy is being throttled and our children's futures are being held back."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: ""Plaid Cymru has shown a way forward. Using the tax powers we have here in Wales, we could generate an extra £317m to offer NHS workers an 8% pay rise - the first real terms pay increase in over a decade - to help tackle staffing shortages and provide care workers with £12 an hour as a minimum."" The Welsh Liberal Democrats, who have one MS in the Senedd, called for more money for NHS dentistry and investment in insulation. A Welsh government spokesman said: ""Our draft budget is designed to protect public services and the most vulnerable in the face of a perfect storm of financial pressures.  ""It built on spending plans previously set out in our three-year budget - and already scrutinised and agreed by the Senedd - supporting programmes helping people through the cost-of-living crisis including the Discretionary Assistance Fund, free school meals and the Pupil Development Grant."" The spokesman said the ""difficult financial picture is limiting our ability to make the level of spending commitments we would like to make"" and the ""key levers for tackling poverty"" with tax and welfare ""largely sit with the UK government"". ""We provided detailed evidence to Senedd committees and look forward to further scrutiny in the debate,"" he added. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-64543608
"Mental health: Ruby, 12, talks about dad's sudden death","A 12-year-old girl was left ""shattered"" after her dad died suddenly the night before he planned to book a family holiday.  The devastating blow came just months after Ruby, from Merthyr Tydfil, had lost her great-grandmother to dementia.  At the time, in 2018, she felt unable to talk about it or even cry, with people saying ""be brave for mam"". After suffering anxiety, Ruby is slowly regaining confidence and wants everyone to be open about their feelings. ""It was one of the most horrible feelings,"" she said, looking back.  ""It has been a real struggle losing them and my mental health has been impacted, but it is getting slowly better. The morning he died came as a real shock and I miss him lots. ""Everyone would say 'be brave for mam'. I felt I had to be fine. There were no tears or anything. I had to keep myself away if I had to deal with emotion."" It was five years ago, when Ruby was seven that her great-grandmother died from vascular dementia and Alzheimer's.  Then, in December of 2018, her dad Jamie, who was 38, had been talking about a family holiday before he went to bed.  But he never woke up - dying suddenly and unexpectedly from a blood clot.  Remembering him fondly, Ruby says: ""Dad was a nutter, to be fair. He was just full of laughter."" While she is able to talk openly about her father now, when she transitioned from primary to high school, her teachers noticed she was quiet and lacking in confidence. Looking back, Ruby says she was experiencing feelings of anxiety about a lot of things, and not sharing these only made her situation worse. ""It was definitely one of the most challenging things I've ever experienced... I didn't talk when I was at my lowest,"" she added. It was at this point her teacher signed her up to the Youth Sport Trust's active in mind programme.  Through a series of games and activities, Ruby was encouraged to discuss her mental help, as well as considering good habits to nurture a healthy mind. She was one of 21,216 young people that were part of the six-week programme in Wales and England.  In groups of 15, they were led by an athlete mentor and five mental health champions. ""We had our world turned upside down and shattered,"" Ruby's mother Adele admitted. She believes her daughter has ""changed so much"" as a result of the sessions and is now that ""confident and bubbly"" pupil in the classroom again. ""Her dad would be so proud of her,"" Adele added.  ""They helped me think about losing my Dad and Gi (great-grandmother),"" Ruby said. ""It made things better because it made me laugh a lot more and helped me to be more active through the games and understand how to keep my body and mind healthy."" Now Ruby is on a mission to encourage her friends to open up, adding: ""I don't think there is enough support for young people in society today when it comes to mental health, and I think our generation can be easily overlooked.  ""Young people should never be afraid to share their emotions and how they are feeling. ""Don't be afraid to cry. I'm not here to judge you for crying."" Youth Sport Trust chief executive Ali Oliver added: ""In the shadow of the pandemic, we are taking urgent action to help the many young people who are struggling with their mental health, and to support schools with practical advice and help.  ""A cost of living emergency is increasing inequality across society and these worries are having an impact on young people too."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64540448
"Digital pound likely this decade, Treasury says","A state-backed digital pound is likely to be launched later this decade, according to the Treasury and the Bank of England. Both institutions want to ensure the public has access to safe money that is easy to use in the digital age. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the central-bank digital currency (CBDC) could be a new  ""trusted and accessible"" way to pay. But it will not be built until at least 2025.  ""We want to investigate what is possible first, whilst always making sure we protect financial stability,"" Mr Hunt said.  The Treasury and the Bank of England will formally start a consultation for the digital currency, on Tuesday. Cryptocurrencies are not backed by a central bank and the value can shoot up and down rapidly. But while it may use technology similar to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, the digital pound, issued by the Bank of England, would be less volatile. Ten digital pounds will always be worth the same as £10 in cash, the Treasury says. Though, as holidaymakers will know, the value of the pound does change relative to other currencies. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak asked the Bank of England to look into backing a currency, in 2021, as chancellor. And in October 2022, Mr Sunak's Financial Service Minister Andrew Griffith warned a lengthy delay could create problems for the economy. Right now, there is probably little need for a digital pound. People use their debit cards or phones, or even watches to fulfil the same function. It is a solution to a problem that does not yet exist. But this is looking towards a near future that sounds like monetary science fiction. At its heart it is about data on what you spend, and what the entire population spends. It is a world where people might just choose to trust international private sector brands, in finance or in tech, more than the state.  Think Amazon, or Facebook, or maybe Chinese-owned Alibaba or Tiktok having a version of sterling. Companies that control the data on everything someone spends, when and where they spend it, will sit on a priceless asset. Unregulated digital currencies could offer those companies incentives to create walled gardens, fragmenting the pound system. It would make controlling the economy more difficult, because £1 might not be worth £1 everywhere. This is where today's ideas come in. Neither the Bank of England nor Government would have access to the data on transactions with a digital pound. But consumers could pick providers, not just banks, to hold their cash in digital wallets, with varying degrees of privacy. Some users might be comfortable with their wallet provider knowing all their transactions, if they received a discount for example. Others might want to stay as private as possible. The Treasury wants to encourage innovation. Other, bigger blocs, such as the USA and the Eurozone also want their digital dollars and digital euros to be international means of exchange. That is less of an overt aim here. The eye here is on maintaining UK monetary sovereignty against upheaval from the likes of Big Tech. If given the go-ahead, there would then be significant investment to launch the currency. There are likely to be initial restrictions on how much of the currency any individual or business could hold. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said the digital pound would provide a new way to make payments, ""help businesses, maintain trust in money and better protect financial stability"". He stressed the importance of the consultation being the ""foundation"" for what would be a ""profound"" decision for the way we use money in the future.  What could a digital pound look like? Countries around the world, including the US, China and the Eurozone, are considering similar proposals. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64536593
Prisoners set to be held in police cells due to overcrowding,"Prisoners are set to be held in police cells within weeks, as plans to cut jail overcrowding were put into action. Last year the government announced it had asked to use 400 cells, following a surge in overcrowding in male prisons and youth jails. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has given the National Police Chiefs' Council) 14 days to make cells in the north of England and West Midlands available. Neither body would confirm how many had been requested. The Press Association said it understood it may be in the region of about 100. In November, justice minister Damian Hinds said there had been a ""highly unusual"" surge of more than 800 prisoners over two months.  The MoJ has described an ""unprecedented increase"" in the number of offenders coming into prisons in the north of England. On Monday, it gave the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) two weeks to make cells available to hold prisoners, after there had been another rise in the number of inmates since the start of the year. An MoJ spokesman said: ""We have given notice to the National Police Chiefs' Council to make available cells in police custody suites in the north of England and West Midlands as planned under Operation Safeguard. ""This will help ensure we have enough spaces to manage the short-term pressure on prison places."" An extra 20,000 prison places are being built, with the newest jail set to open in the spring, the spokesman added. Critics previously warned the problem could have been predicted, while others claimed the plan could put the public and police officers in danger. An initial £14m has been allocated for the scheme, based on estimations it will be needed for three months, and the funds will be taken from the MoJ's existing budget. But the total cost to the department will depend on the number of cells occupied and how long for. When he made the announcement, Mr Hinds described Operation Safeguard is an ""established protocol"", which has been used before in periods of ""high demand"" including between 2006 and 2008. He stressed the country had ""not run out of prison places"" and the emergency measures - which will provide the ""immediate additional capacity"" needed - ""do not reflect a failure to plan ahead"". As of Friday, the prison population stood at 83,188 with a ""useable operational capacity"" of 84,607, indicating close to 1,500 spaces are available. It was understood some spaces were always kept free so prisons had the capacity to operate safely and respond to any unforeseen circumstances, PA said.

Morriston cemetery: Mourners had to dodge speeding car at funeral,"Grieving families witnessed a mass brawl at a cemetery in Swansea which left two people seriously injured, a court has heard. Armed police were called to the fight, involving members of four families, at Morriston Cemetery on 5 August 2022. It involved baseball bats, cars being driven at high speed and men spitting on the floor of the remembrance room. Nine men were arrested and have appeared at Swansea Crown Court, having pleaded guilty to violent disorder.  Eight of them are due to be sentenced at a later date. They are: A separate hearing will take place in the case of one defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Two youths, who also cannot be named for legal reasons, are to appear in court later this week. Prosecutor Helen Randall described to the court how ""severe disruption"" was caused to mourners at the cemetery, including a man attending his wife's funeral with his five children.  The court heard the brawl was the result of a feud between two family factions: the O'Brian and Coffey faction, and the Murphy and Thomas faction.  Members of the Coffey and O'Brian families were at the cemetery for a blessing of Michael and Margaret O'Brian's gravestones, but ""what followed was an incident of violent disorder involving all 11 defendants"", Ms Randall said. Ms Randall said weapons were used to cause injury, vehicles driven at each other and gravestones damaged.  Two funerals were taking place at the time of the offence, added Ms Randall, including the funeral of one woman attended by her husband and their five children, one of whom was heavily pregnant.  CCTV footage from inside the cemetery's service room shows one defendant, Patrick Joseph Murphy, hiding a baseball bat within flowers, ""damaging floral arrangements"". The same footage depicts his sons, John Murphy and Paddy Murphy, spitting on the floor of the remembrance room, something Judge Paul Thomas described as ""an act of great disrespect, even desecration"".  Other footage from the day shows vehicles speeding through the cemetery, with other mourners jumping out of their paths.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64543932
Betsi Cadwaladr did not discuss resuscitation decision with family,"A health board has apologised to the family of a patient after medical staff failed to consult with them over a decision not to resuscitate her. While the decision was clinically justified, the public services ombudsman for Wales said Betsi Cadwaladr health board did not discuss it with the patient and her family. Ms Morris called on the health board to apologise for a ""serious injustice"". The north Wales health board said it had apologised for its ""failings"". The ombudsman, Michelle Morris, also upheld a complaint by the patient's daughter, identified only as Miss A, that her mother's discharge from Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor was ""inappropriate"" and that insufficient steps were taken to ensure her needs could be safely met at home. The final complaint, which was also upheld, was that medics failed to communicate with the family about the deteriorating condition of the patient, identified as Mrs B, which meant a family visit was not arranged before she died. Ms Morris did not accept, however, that the patient should not have been transferred to Ysbyty Penrhos Stanley in Holyhead, Anglesey. In her report she said the Covid pandemic had contributed to the failings, but added ""this was a serious injustice to the family"". As well as apologising to the family, she asked that all medical staff at Ysbyty Gwynedd and Ysbyty Penrhos Stanley be reminded of the importance of following the proper procedure when deciding when a patient should not be resuscitated. Angela Wood, executive director of nursing and midwifery at Betsi Cadwaladr health board, said: ""We have offered our sincere apologies to Mr B and the family for the failings identified and the distress these will have caused.

Coronation official playlist picks golden oldies,"The Beatles, David Bowie, Tom Jones and the Spice Girls are included on an official government Coronation playlist, published on Spotify.

The grime artist was convicted last year of assaulting his former partner.  ""A track featuring Dizzee Rascal was included in error - and as soon as this was identified, it was removed,"" a DCMS spokeswoman said. King Charles III will be crowned on Saturday, 6 May, alongside Camilla, the Queen Consort, who has been a longstanding campaigner against domestic violence. The playlist published on Monday seems to nod more towards the golden oldies or, as the DCMS suggests, ""classics"". The singalong choice begins with The Beatles and the message Come Together, followed by Boney M's Daddy Cool. The party playlist includes: A spokeswoman said the playlist had been selected to ""celebrate British and Commonwealth artists ahead of the upcoming Coronation"".

It includes recipe ideas for parties, including Ken Hom's Coronation lamb and Nadiya Hussain's Coronation aubergine. Coronation chicken was invented for Queen Elizabeth's coronation, in 1953.

This will include traditional sights such as the carriage procession and appearances on the Buckingham Palace balcony. But there will be no lighting of beacons, ending a tradition from previous jubilees and coronations. The Coronation service, at Westminster Abbey, is expected to be more diverse and shorter than the previous three-hour ceremony, in 1953.

Energy giant BP sees record profits of $28bn,"Energy giant BP has reported record annual profits after oil and gas prices surged last year following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The company's profits more than doubled to $27.7bn (£23bn) in 2022, compared with $12.8bn the year before. Other energy firms have seen similar rises, with Shell reporting record earnings of nearly $40bn last week. The profits have led to calls for energy firms to pay more tax as many households struggle with rising bills. BP boss Bernard Looney said the British company was ""helping provide the energy the world needs"" and investing the transition to green energy. Energy prices had begun to climb following the end of Covid lockdowns but rose sharply in March last year after Russia invaded Ukraine, sparking concerns about supplies. The price of Brent crude oil reached nearly $128 a barrel following the invasion, but has since fallen back to about $80. Gas prices also spiked but have come down from their highs.  It has led to bumper profits for energy companies, but also fuelled a rise in energy bills for households and businesses.  Last year, the UK government introduced a windfall tax - called the Energy Profits Levy - to help fund its scheme to lower gas and electricity bills. The windfall tax only applies to profits made from extracting UK oil and gas. The rate was originally set at 25%, but has now been increased to 35%. Oil and gas firms also pay 30% corporation tax on their profits as well as a supplementary 10% rate. Along with the new windfall tax, that takes their total tax rate to 75%, although companies are able to reduce the amount of tax they pay by factoring in losses or spending on things like decommissioning North Sea oil platforms.

One in five homes have not cashed energy vouchers,"One in five households with prepayment meters have not cashed in their energy vouchers issued to help pay bills. Data seen by the BBC showed about 380,000 vouchers, totalling up to 19% of homes, were not redeemed each month in October and in November. It means as much as £50m of government support for energy has gone unclaimed by some of the most vulnerable. The government urged energy firms to do more to make sure customers got the help they were entitled to. ""When a voucher is not redeemed, suppliers must make at least three attempts to reach the customer, by more than one means which can include post, email and text message. Customers with a traditional pre-payment meter can contact their energy supplier to have a voucher re-issued even if it has expired. The re-issued voucher will then be valid for three months beginning on the date it was re-issued.""   The Energy Support Scheme provides £400 to each household in Britain. Most of the homes in England, Scotland and Wales pay their energy bill by direct debit and have been getting about £66 a month knocked off their bills or credited to their account automatically. However, the system has been more cumbersome for the two million households that have a traditional pre-payment meter for their gas or electricity. They receive the support through vouchers in the post or via email.  The vouchers then need to be taken to a local PayPoint store or a Post Office to be credited onto a meter.  Many households with traditional pre-payment meters are considered among the most vulnerable. Customers pay for their energy in advance, either through an account or using a top-up card and in many cases these meters have often been fitted when people have a history of missing bill payments. Figures from both PayPoint and the Post Office showed that 81% of vouchers for October and November were cashed before they expired, meaning 19% - roughly 380,000 homes - did not cash those vouchers before the November expiry date on 5 February. Although the deadline has passed, it is still possible for the voucher money to be claimed. A person who has not received their voucher or has not cashed it in time needs to contact their energy supplier, check that their contact details are correct, and ask for the voucher to be re-issued to them.  With exactly the same proportion of vouchers not redeemed for both October and November, it could mean that some households have missed out both months, and therefore be £132 out-of-pocket. According to Citizens Advice, the main reason for people not cashing an energy voucher is because they haven not received it yet.  Dr Elizabeth Blakelock, an energy specialist at the charity, said some people had been told to check emails for vouchers, but did not have access to the internet. ""They don't use an email account regularly so they can't use that method,"" she added. ""And there seems to be many people where their address data is incorrect, so it just hasn't landed on their doorstep."" Energy suppliers have been criticised for their treatment of vulnerable customers, and especially over the issue of forcibly fitted prepayment meters.  Charities say vulnerable people who have been switched have not been able to afford to top-up their meter, leaving them in the cold and dark during the winter. The latest data comes during a series of developments on the issue during the last 24 hours including: Dr Blakelock said there was a ""core group"" of people who were ""just not getting the support that they need"". ""What we need to see is for the energy companies to make it really easy for people to get in contact with them so that they can re-issue those vouchers,"" she added. Steve O'Neill, corporate affairs and marketing director at PayPoint said of the people who cashed their vouchers in its stores, 23% waited less than a day before redeeming it.

"Boeing: Plane maker plans to cut 2,000 office jobs this year","Plane maker Boeing plans to cut about 2,000 jobs in finance and human resources this year, as it focuses on engineering and manufacturing. The move comes as the company puts more of its resources into ""products, services and technology development"". It will outsource some of the roles to Tata Consulting Services, a unit of one of India's largest conglomerates. Boeing has faced a number of issues in recent years, including the grounding of its 737 Max after two fatal crashes. ""We have and will continue to communicate transparently with our teams that we expect lower staffing within some corporate support functions,"" the company told the BBC. ""As always, we will support affected teammates and provide assistance and resources to support their transition,"" it added. Around a third of the jobs will be outsourced to Tata Consulting Services, which is based in Bangalore (also known as Bengaluru). However, Boeing also said that it will continue to increase its headcount ""with a focus on engineering and manufacturing"". On top of the 15,000 people it hired in 2022, the company said it aims to recruit another 10,000 this year. The aviation giant has been working to turn itself around after its 737 Max passenger jet was grounded worldwide after two fatal accidents. On 29 October 2018, Lion Air Flight 610 crashed into the Java Sea 13 minutes after taking off from Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, killing all 189 passengers and crew. Less than five months later, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, another Boeing 737 Max on its way to Kenya, crashed six minutes after leaving Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa. All 157 people on board were killed. It later emerged that both accidents were triggered by design flaws, in particular the use of flight control software known as the ""Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System"" (MCAS). The system was designed to assist pilots familiar with previous generations of the 737, and prevent them from needing costly extra training in order to fly the new model. But sensor failures caused it to malfunction, and in both cases it forced the aircraft into a catastrophic dive the pilots were unable to prevent. After modifications to the aircraft and pilot training, the 737 Max aircraft has now been cleared to fly again in most countries around the world. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64549761
Register of Overseas Entities: What three luxury homes reveal about who owns UK property,"Owners of around 50,000 UK properties held by foreign companies remain hidden from public view, despite new transparency laws. The Register of Overseas Entities, launched in August 2022, was meant to reveal who ultimately owns UK property. But analysis by BBC News and Transparency International found almost half of firms required to declare who is behind them failed to do so. Labour MP Margaret Hodge said the legislation was not ""fit for purpose"". A UK government spokesperson said the register has been an ""invaluable source of information for law enforcement, and tax and revenue services"". The UK government has long promised to crack down on ""corrupt elites"" from overseas, including ""Russian oligarchs and kleptocrats"", using UK property to launder illegal wealth. Ministers insisted they would crack down on foreign criminals using UK property to launder money by ensuring they ""can't hide behind secretive chains of shell companies"". As a result, under a law passed in February 2022 in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, ministers said anonymous foreign companies seeking to buy UK land or property would be required to reveal full details of the individuals who ultimately owned them. Overseas organisations that already owned land in the UK were given a six-month period to do the same. Now that six-month grace period is up - all the people, whatever their reputations,  behind companies that own thousands of British properties should have been uncovered for the first time.  The BBC and Transparency International matched thousands of filings from the new register with Land Registry records. This analysis suggests that some 18,000 offshore companies - which between them hold more than 50,000 properties in England and Wales - either ignored the law altogether or filed information in such a way that it remains impossible for the public to find out who the individuals are who ultimately own and benefit from them. ""While the register is starting to serve its intended purpose, our analysis reveals there are far too many companies that could be trying to skirt the rules, not knowing they exist, or ignoring them altogether,"" says Duncan Hames, Director of Policy at Transparency International UK. To understand how the law is and isn't working, it helps to look at three very expensive properties. The first is a pair of luxury apartments. Another is a sprawling £48m estate in north London, the third a £10m country mansion.  All have been linked in some way to figures connected with Vladimir Putin's regime. For instance, look at the two luxury flats in central London worth an estimated £11m. Their ownership by the former Russian deputy prime minister, Igor Shuvalov, was first reported by the Anti-Corruption Foundation, set up by jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. According to the UK government, who placed him under sanction in March 2022, Mr Shuvalov - who heads the management board of a Russian bank -  is ""a core part of Putin's inner circle"".  And now the register has confirmed that he and his wife are the ultimate owners of the flats, held through a Russian company, Sova Real Estate LLC. Mr Shuvalov's spokesperson told the BBC last year that these issues ""have been the subject of competent government audits"", and that ""no complaints were ever filed"". But while there are thousands of examples where the register is working, the ultimate ownership of thousands of properties remains shielded from public view.  Take Beechwood House, a north London estate bought for £48m in 2008 with a value around £85m.  After Russia's invasion of Ukraine 12 months ago, the UK government came down hard on wealthy businessmen close to Putin's regime. Assets were frozen, stopping rich Russians from taking their money out of the UK.  But it wasn't always clear exactly which assets belonged to these oligarchs.  For instance, Beechwood House was listed by the government as owned by oligarch and ex-Arsenal shareholder Alisher Usmanov when it announced sanctions against him. A spokesperson for the oligarch has now told the BBC that he transferred Beechwood House, as well as other assets, to family trusts ""long before sanctions were imposed"" and that while Mr Usmanov was a beneficiary for a period of time, he withdrew ""on an irrevocable basis"". The spokesperson added: ""Neither Mr Usmanov nor members of his family are the beneficial owners of these companies.""  You would think the register should shed light on who actually owns Beechwood House. But it does not. The owner is given as Hanley Limited, an Isle of Man company. And in turn the beneficial owner of Hanley Limited is Swiss company Pomerol Capital SA, which controls it as part of a trust structure.  However, nothing about the individuals who own Pomerol Capital is listed on the public register.  That is because companies owned through trusts - as opposed to other set-ups - are exempt from having their beneficial owner information made public on the register.  So from the filing, it is impossible to identify the people who own, control or stand to benefit from Beechwood House- a property that the government itself said was owned by Mr Usmanov, which would have made it subject to an asset freeze. While the names of individuals linked to trusts are not included in the register, companies do have to provide their details privately to the corporate registry Companies House.  And many other owners have found an even more straightforward means of keeping their names off the register - by simply not complying with the new legislation. Overseas companies with property in the UK - bought since January 1999 in England and Wales and since December 2014 in Scotland - were supposed to reveal the identity of their owners by 31 January.  But around half of offshore firms with property in England and Wales - approximately 15,000 - had no matching record in the property register before last week's government deadline. This includes the company that owns a £90m home in west London linked with former Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. The Cyprus-based firm does not yet appear to have submitted its details to the property register.  Mr Abramovich could not be reached for comment. As well as the firms that are yet to file, BBC analysis has found that one in four offshore companies that have submitted their details have actually included other foreign firms, not people, as their owners. Some of these are owned by trusts, as with Beechwood House.  But that is not the only way in which companies are avoiding publicly disclosing the individuals who are actually behind them. And there is a third category - companies that have filed their details to the property register, but have not complied with the rules.  The BBC's investigation has identified more than 1,800 companies whose filings do not appear to do so. Among these is Uart International, a Panamanian company that, according to Land Registry records, acquired a countryside mansion in 2008. As part of the Pandora Papers, a leak of almost 12 million files, the property was owned through an offshore corporate network controlled by Vladimir Chernukhin and his wife, Lubov. Mr Chernukhin is a former Russian deputy minister of finance and businessman who had financial links to oligarchs close to the Kremlin. He moved to the UK after being sacked by Putin in 2004 and insists he is not a supporter of the Russian president.  His wife Lubov, whom he married in London in 2007, is a major donor to the Conservative Party, having given the Tories more than £2.3m since 2012. Companies House records show that Uart International lists another foreign firm as its ""person of significant control"". This means that the individuals who ultimately own the property remain hidden from the public register, despite the change in the legislation. Under the new regulations, another anonymous offshore firm should not be named as the owner of a company with UK property. There is no indication in the filings that the company owner is a trustee, which would exempt the firm from having their person of significant control revealed on the register  - suggesting it could be a violation of the rules. Lawyers for the couple told the BBC that ""Mr and Mrs Chernukhin do not support, and have never supported, the policies of President Putin, nor are they allies of President Putin"" and that they are ""unaware of Uart ever having made corporate filings contrary to the applicable rules and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions"".  While the new rules include severe penalties for companies and individuals who do not comply, experts have questioned whether this will work.  ""Although the legislation contains some stringent penalties for non-compliance, the government has failed to equip Companies House with the teeth and resources to apply these in practice,"" says Helena Wood, head of the UK Economic Crime Programme at the Royal United Services Institute think tank. Margaret Hodge MP, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on anti-corruption and responsible tax, said the new register was ""turning into a joke"". She added: ""We need to know who owns these fantastically expensive properties, why they bought them and how they got the money to do so."" A government spokesperson said that Companies House was now ""assessing and preparing cases for enforcement action"" and further legislation would allow it to impose fines and pursue legal avenues against companies that are flouting the law.

Nissan warns costs must fall to make new electric cars in UK,"A senior boss at Nissan has warned the ""economics have to work"" for the company to make new electric models of its Juke and Qashqai cars in the UK. Ashwani Gupta, chief operating officer at the firm, told the BBC the UK faced a challenge to remain competitive with other car-making countries. He said manufacturing costs in the UK were higher than others due to higher energy bills and overall inflation. Nissan employs more than 6,000 people at its Sunderland manufacturing plant. Mr Gupta warned having lower production costs was key to keeping the UK competitive. He added other tools to keep the UK attractive to car-makers were ongoing government support in the transition to electric vehicles, as well as robust supply chains.   Nissan has already committed to producing the successor to its Leaf electric car at its factory in Sunderland, but Mr Gupta said that when it came to allocating production of new Juke and Qashqai models between its 44 global plants, the company ""needed to have the economics to justify it"".  The decision of where to build the new Juke and Qashqai does not have to made for a couple of years yet as the next models of those big Sunderland-made sellers are not due until 2027-28, and decisions are usually made two or three years in advance.   Car makers often press governments to provide more support. Nissan recently secured about £100m in public money towards a £1bn investment in expanding a Chinese-owned battery plant located right next to its Sunderland plant.   But the map of global car manufacturing is being reshaped and the US is offering tens of billions in subsidies to car makers who move production and supply chains there. The EU is also expected to respond with carrots of its own.  The comments from Mr Gupta come as Nissan and Renault unveiled the details of a major shake-up of their often strained 24-year-old alliance, after months of negotiations between the motor industry giants. In a joint statement, the two firms said they had ""rebalanced"" their relationship by agreeing that Renault would cut its stake in Nissan. Under the deal, Nissan will take a stake in Renault's flagship electric car unit Ampere. The companies also said that they will work together on electronics and battery technology, as well as making savings from joint projects in Europe, India and Latin America. The agreement will see Renault cutting its stake in Japan's Nissan from more than 43% to 15%, the same size as Nissan's stake in its French counterpart. The companies also said that Nissan will take a stake of up to 15% in Renault's new electric vehicle venture, Ampere. Christopher Richter from investment group CLSA said the changes were necessary to keep the two-decade partnership alive. ""It's a last ditch attempt to save an alliance where the two partners don't get along very well,"" he told the BBC. ""Hopefully, by equalising their status in the alliance, they can put some of the rancour behind them, and find a limited number of activities where they can cooperate and add value to each other,"" Mr Richter added. The move comes at a time of huge change for the motor industry as it transitions to electric vehicles and adopts new technology. ""We all know that auto firms will be amalgamated into five or six globally, especially due to the big changes occurring in AI technology,"" Seijiro Takeshita from the University of Shizuoka in Japan told the BBC. ""In that context, Nissan and Renault need to find a good partner, and that's what they are, at least nominally. They cannot and do not have the luxury of going alone in this battle,"" he added. The alliance was formed in 1999 when Renault rescued Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy. In 2016, they were joined by Mitsubishi, after Nissan took a major stake in the struggling Japanese firm. The alliance was rocked in November 2018 when Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn was arrested over allegations that he had understated his annual salary and misused company funds. Mr Ghosn denied the charges. At the time, Mr Ghosn was the chairman of the Japanese carmaker. He was also chairman of France's Renault and the boss of a three-way alliance between both carmakers and Mitsubishi.

Prepayment meters: Magistrates told to stop allowing forced installations,"Magistrates courts in England and Wales are to stop hearing and ruling on applications from energy firms to forcibly install prepayment meters with immediate effect. One of the country's most senior judges said the cases must be halted in light of the growing concern.  It comes days after the BBC revealed that courts have been waving through applications to install these meters. Regulator Ofgem has asked all companies to suspend forcible installations.  Monday's order from Lord Justice Edis, the judge who oversees the workings of all courts, now makes both a practical impossibility as it instructs each centre to stop listing the warrant applications until further notice.  Lord Justice Edis said all magistrates had to ""act proportionately and with regard to the human rights of the people affected, [in] particular any people with vulnerability"". A warrant officer, who has applied for prepayment meter warrants on behalf of energy companies for two decades, told BBC Newsnight he welcomes the decision but claims it has been a serious concern for years. ""Robert"", who is not being identified as he does not want his employer to know he has spoken to the media, says: ""In 2015, we would apply for a warrant in person at a local court with 20-30 applications. ""I would find cases where there were vulnerabilities and draw the magistrate's attention to that and they would then refuse the warrant. None of that exists anymore.""  Robert says bulk applications started being introduced followed by a new online and telephone system for magistrates from 2019. ""I have seen 200-300 applications submitted in one go, but I have colleagues who have emailed spreadsheets containing thousands of addresses which are then processed in around 15 minutes,"" he explains. Lord Justice Edis said that while energy firms could still make a case for a warrant to be heard, they would have to first satisfy a court ""in detail as to the integrity of their procedures, in particular relating to the vulnerability of occupiers"". He has not put a limit on how long the moratorium will last for, but said that its lifting would depend on investigations by Ofgem and the government.  Peter Smith, director of policy at the fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, said magistrates' courts had been ""far too quick to rubber stamp batches of warrants, with little or no scrutiny."" ""It provides some relief that magistrates are now aware of the significance of their actions and not blind to the terrible impacts to vulnerable people if they are forced onto prepayment meters against their will,"" he added. This weekend, the leaking of advice from England and Wales' top magistrate to the BBC showed that courts were being told that challenges to energy companies mass claims for such warrants were ""irrational"" and questions previously asked were ""now disproportionate"".  The crux of the issue is that energy suppliers assurances ""under oath"" especially that none of the customers listed were vulnerable, were taken in good faith. But charity campaigners contend that the energy companies' systems are not correctly identifying vulnerable customers, the elderly, those with very young children, and those with disabilities.  While today's move should create some relief for some customers, it does not solve the fundamental problem.  The deployment of prepayment meters was meant to be an alternative to rarely used sanction of disconnection. If that is not an option, there are concerns that bills simply will not be paid at all. This may all end up eventually, back at the door of government. Last week, the Times newspaper found that debt agents for British Gas had broken into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters. Chris O'Shea, chief executive of British Gas's parent company Centrica, said he was horrified at the findings, and the firm said it would suspend forcefully installing prepayment meters until at least after the winter. Business Secretary Grant Shapps said on Sunday that Ofgem had allowed itself to have ""the wool pulled over their eyes"" over prepayment meters being force-fitted, taking companies ""at face value"" instead of listening to customers. He has given energy firms until Tuesday to report back on what action they will take, potentially including compensation, in response to complaints from any customers who have had prepayment meters wrongfully installed. In the House of Commons, Energy Minister Graham Stuart said he had met with the boss of Ofgem and said the government expected ""strong and immediate action where suppliers fall short of their obligations"". But Ed Miliband, shadow secretary of state for climate change, said the response was ""simply not good enough"", and accused the government of ""sitting on their hands and being far too slow to act"". ""Ofgem did reviews in September and November and highlighted the problem - where was the government? In early January Citizens Advice reported that three million people had been disconnected by the back door,"" he said. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64542229
'I'm obsessed with my smart meter',"When Karen Alexander moved into her new house she found it had an energy smart meter. She quite liked how it told her much she was spending in real time. But as energy prices rocketed over the past year she found checking the meter was becoming an obsession. ""I realised it's the first thing I do in the morning, and when you see how much you've already spent it makes your tummy take a lurch,"" she told the BBC. Charities have said they are hearing rising reports of smart meter anxiety. Age UK and disability rights charity Scope have told the BBC that although smart meters can help with budgeting they can also have a negative impact on people's mental health. Common signs of smart meter anxiety include repeatedly checking your smart meter, worrying about what it means for your finances and feeling out of control, said BBC Morning Live's Dr Ranj. Karen's husband isn't well at the moment, so the couple are in the house a lot, which she thinks is part of the problem.  ""When you're in the house and you've not got work to take your mind off it, it can really prey on you. It's almost like a demon on your shoulder constantly reminding you how much you've spent,"" she said. Karen describes herself as having smart meter anxiety, and laughs while explaining that she's had to turn the display unit to face the wall.  She has limited herself to only checking the meter at the start and end of each day. ""I just don't want that financial worry to be in my face all the time,"" she said.  And she's not alone, one BBC Morning Live viewer, Catherine Lamb, contacted the programme to say that she had shut hers in a drawer, as she ""was becoming too obsessed by it and panicking"". More than half of all households in the UK now have a smart meter. The government has spent billions on their roll out, and for many households they are a useful tool.  The smart device that sends automatic meter readings is within gas and electricity boxes, but they also come with a small in-home display unit. It shows how much energy we're using in real-time so it can help identify the appliances and activities that cost the most.  It also shows how much we've been charged per day or week, so it can help you keep on top of rising energy bills.  But Age UK and Scope have told the BBC they are encountering people who find the in-home display a source of anxiety.  ""When older people are struggling with their bills, as considerable numbers are, the constant pressure of watching the display dipping into the red after only a few hours of putting the heating on is really distressing,"" says Age UK charity director Caroline Abrahams. The charity is calling for clearer instructions during installation and better phone support for those who are worried.  ""If the government, Ofgem, and suppliers want older people to maintain confidence in smart meters they need to deliver tailored support to those for whom smart meters are a frightening reminder of just how unaffordable their energy bills currently are,"" says Ms Abrahams. BBC Morning Live's Dr Ranj said: ""Anxiety can be situational or general. When it's related to devices like smart meters there are some simple steps that can help alleviate the stress"". These are: Energy watchdog Ofgem said under its rules energy suppliers must give smart meter customers information in plain and easy to understand language.  They must also meet the needs of vulnerable groups such as the elderly, disabled or chronically sick. Where these standards are not met, the regulator takes action ""to protect customers during these very challenging times,"" it added. Ofgem's website has energy advice for households. A spokesperson for the government said that energy suppliers are obliged to provide ""tailored"" advice at installation, to ensure people know how to benefit from the smart metering system. ""We understand people are concerned about energy prices which is why we have acted swiftly to provide support, including the Energy Price Guarantee, which is saving the typical household around £900 this winter"", the spokesperson added. While in-home displays show real-time costs, they don't show that spending in the context of the extra financial help from the government. All households are currently receiving a £67 discount every month until March, there are extra winter fuel payments to pensioners, and cost-of-living payments to those on certain disability benefits.  Michelle Dearden has complex post-traumatic stress disorder and autism. She fell behind with her energy bills when she became unwell and was switched to a pre-payment meter with a smart meter by her supplier. She said looking at the device makes her anxious and fearful, but she needs to be able to see how much credit she has left on her account. She's resorted to hiding it behind a plant pot. ""I don't think they even thought about the effect a smart meter could have on people who are neurodiverse,"" said the 53-year-old from Mid-Wales. ""If I so much as put on the kettle, the screen switches from green to orange. For me that's like an orange warning light coming on your car while you're driving along and it's very stressful."" She constantly worries that the money is not going to last. ""There is nothing else I can cut back on,"" she said. ""The gas heating only goes on if I need to use the bathroom or have a shower."" She said given the choice she would not have had a smart meter installed. ""It's not healthy, it is frustrating, embarrassing and degrading. I worry constantly and there is a shame attached about not being able to afford energy."" Dr Tom Hargreaves, an associate professor at the University of East Anglia, conducted a study more than 10 years ago with some of the first households to adopt smart meters. He said he found a link to stress even then, when energy prices were much lower. Dr Hargreaves said that worry became most pronounced when the householder felt they had already made all the energy efficiency savings they could, or when they had little choice but to use more energy such as when a child was ill. ""What we saw back then was a problem which could escalate. What's happened to energy prices since then has caused that escalation."" Although he believes smart meters are a very useful tool in reducing energy usage, he said they are a blunt instrument without other accompanying information.  ""Smart meters have a tendency to individualise the problem, make owners feel that rising energy bills are to be dealt with by each household alone, and that adds to anxiety,"" he said. Dr Ranj said if you find that your anxiety is really problematic seek help. ""Head over to the NHS website where you can access the Every Mind Matters resources including self-help cognitive behavioural therapy techniques, as well as referring yourself to talking therapies.""

Britishvolt: UK battery start-up set to be bought by Australian firm,"An Australian firm has been named as the preferred bidder for Britishvolt, the UK battery start-up which collapsed last month. Recharge Industries, which is owned by New York fund Scale Facilitation Partners, has entered an agreement to buy Britishvolt's business and assets. Britishvolt was put into administration after running out of money. It had planned to build a giant factory to make electric car batteries near Blyth, Northumberland. EY, the accountancy firm and administrator to Britishvolt which has been overseeing the sale, said: ""Completion of the acquisition is expected to occur within the next seven days.""  Recharge Industries is building a facility in Australia to produce batteries for electric vehicles. Little detail has emerged on its plans for the Britishvolt business, which had hoped to build a £3.8bn factory as part a long-term strategy to boost the UK's manufacturing of electric vehicle batteries. It had been hoped it would create 3,000 skilled jobs. Instead, more than 200 people lost their jobs when Britishvolt collapsed. It was forced to delay the start of production at the plant a number of times, most recently blaming ""difficult external economic headwinds including rampant inflation and rising interest rates"". Building this battery plant is seen as absolutely vital to securing the future of UK car manufacturing. But the last time an ambitious start-up, with unproven technology led by people unheard of in the battery and car world, attempted this it ended up in the spectacular failure of Britishvolt, which collapsed into administration last month.  Winning the bid to buy Britishvolt out of administration, Recharge Industries conceded they had paid a premium over the other bidders, but said that was indicative of their confidence in a project that would bring together Australian minerals, US battery know-how and a promising UK site.  But the people who decided who won are not required to care about any of that. The administrators EY have just one job - getting the most cash for the people owed money by the defunct Britishvolt. The government insists that while it is ""monitoring the situation"", this is a matter between private businesses. But industry figures remain frustrated and disappointed that ministers don't feel the need to take a more muscular and strategic role in such a key development.  Today's announcement begs more questions than it answers and should be seen as a beginning rather than the end of this process.  David Collard, chief executive of Scale Facilitation and founder of Recharge Industries, said it ""can't wait to get started making a reality of our plans to build the UK's first gigafactory"". Recharge is building a battery-making factory in Geelong, Melbourne which, according to its website, will begin operating in 2024. Recharge reportedly beat a number of others to become the preferred bidder for Britishvolt. EY said it followed a process ""that involved the consideration of multiple approaches from interested parties and numerous offers received"".  Indriatti van Hien, deputy fund manager at Janus Henderson Investments, told the BBC: ""The acquisition of Britishvolt will really give them a toe-hold in Europe. ""It is interesting really because there are a lot of British companies bidding for this asset too.""  Britishvolt's collapse was a blow to the government's ""levelling up"" agenda started by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson. It was hoped it would boost the economy in Blyth which was one of the main so-called ""red wall"" seats to change hands from Labour to the Conservatives in the 2019 General Election. The government had committed £100m in funding for the project. That had helped the company to secure a further £1.7bn in funding from private investors.  The then Business Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said Britishvolt's factory and the jobs it would create was ""exactly what levelling up looks like"". ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64535346
Cost of living: Call for better pension saving deal for under-22s and low-paid,"Younger and lower-paid workers should be included in a scheme which sees people automatically enrolled into pension saving, a think tank says. Current rules require workers aged 22 and above to be enrolled, and receive a contribution from their employer, when they earn more than £10,000 a year. The Social Market Foundation (SMF) says those from minority ethnic backgrounds disproportionately miss out. The government says it is planning to make these changes, when affordable. Aveek Bhattacharya, research director at the SMF, a centrist think tank, said: ""Sensible changes to pensions auto-enrolment rules would bring more ethnic minorities into pension saving, increasing their chances of enjoying the comfortable retirement that everyone deserves."" In a wide-ranging study, supported by the consumer group Which?, the SMF also called on the government to accelerate its plans to allow workers to be included from the age of 18. That will reignite the debate over whether teenage workers would want some of their wages diverted into a workplace pension scheme, when their budget is squeezed by cost-of-living pressures. All employers must offer a workplace pension scheme to their staff, and automatically enrol those who fit certain criteria. They include people who are not already signed up to a workplace pension, earn at least £10,000 a year per job, and are aged between 22 and state pension age. Workers can opt out if they do not want to save. Otherwise, 5% of their earnings above £6,240 a year, including tax relief, and a contribution from their employer worth 3% of earnings, is automatically saved into a pension pot which is invested. The idea is to encourage saving for retirement from an earlier age, to top up the state pension in later life. It has been widely regarded a success since its introduction in 2012, with relatively few people opting out. The SMF said that people from ethnic minorities were much less likely than white Britons to save into a workplace pension, suggesting that 25% did so, compared with a national average of 38%. They were disproportionately likely to be younger and poorer, meaning they were missing out. The think tank also suggested there was heightened scepticism about financial services within these groups, with lower levels of awareness and trust, even among those earning bigger salaries. ""Part of the responsibility for addressing this situation should lie with government, but it is also incumbent on financial firms to do their bit as well,"" it said. Among its recommendations were: Workers can opt in to the pension saving scheme when they earn more than £6,240, but the SMF suggestion to cancel the earnings threshold follows similar calls from pension providers. Andrew Tully, technical director at Canada Life, said: ""The best ideas are often the simple ones and these recommendations are not only easy to deliver, but will reward many more people effectively saving for their retirements, increasing pension coverage irrespective of social or economic background.  ""This will help many people who are multiple jobbers but where each individual job falls below the current £10,000 threshold, so won't enjoy the benefits of auto-enrolment. This includes many women."" The government said that it was planning to abolish the lower earnings limit, and cut the age for automatic enrolment from 22 to 18 by the mid-2020s. ""It is important that we make sure that these changes are made in a way and at a time that is affordable, balancing the needs of savers, employers and taxpayers,"" said Laura Trott, the Pensions Minister. She said that automatic enrolment had ""transformed pension saving"", with more than 10.8 million workers enrolled into a workplace pension and an additional £33bn saved in real terms in 2021 compared with 2012. Separately, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has called on the government to overhaul the tax treatment of pensions. The leading economic research group argues that the current system gives overgenerous tax breaks to those with the biggest pensions and the biggest contributions from employers.

Scottish courts to review warrants for force-fitting meters,"Scotland's court service has said it will review the process for utility warrants following outcry over forced installation of pay-as-you-go meters. It is thought at least 32,000 such warrants were applied for by energy companies in Scotland in 2022. The Times recently found debt agents for British Gas had broken into vulnerable people's homes to fit the meters. On Thursday industry regulator Ofgem asked firms to suspend the practice. It requested that all suppliers reviewed the use of court warrants to enter the homes of customers in arrears and said firms must get their ""house in order"". In Scotland there is no overall record of how many utility warrants have been granted, with only some individual courts choosing to record the information. The Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service (SCTS) told BBC Scotland it does maintain the number of submissions for warrants by utility firms for ""processing the relevant court fee"". But it added: ""A working group has now been established to review the process for dealing with utility warrants, including the data recorded, with a view to improving the information currently available."" Although Ofgem has ordered a review into pre-payment meters to ""uncover poor practice"", it does not have the power to enforce a total ban. However, British Gas and EDF announced they would stop forced installation while they conducted reviews. Energy firm OVO said it had stopped in November last year. After a long period of non-payment by a customer, an energy company may seek to place them on to a pre-payment meter. The firm will apply for a warrant under the Right of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954 - a piece of legislation drafted when utilities were under state control. The warrants are dealt with by Scotland's Justice of the Peace court - the lowest level of the court system that normally deals with minor criminal matters. It is presided over by a justice of the peace, a lay magistrate appointed from the local community. The act itself states the companies have to satisfy a justice of the peace that they have met their obligations to the customer. This would include a letter to the customer seven days before the firm applies for the warrant. Unless the customer objects, the warrant will be granted without a hearing.  Campaigners such as the Poverty Alliance and Energy Action Scotland have said the system is ""opaque"" and that the notification process is not adequate.  Alan McIntosh, debt advisor and campaigner, told BBC Scotland he had been contacting authorities for months to gather information about the process. He said: ""People are in the dark. It's been a worrying time for people who are maybe themselves getting in more and more debt because of the fuel bills. ""The problem is that it seems to be completely untransparent for people. How this process works, what the companies can command and what they do. ""For some, the first time you know anything, you may have a warrant granted against you."" In an example guidance form shared by Mr McIntosh with the BBC and used in Tayside, there are no questions about whether the debt is disputed or the customer's vulnerability. The Herald newspaper originally reported there were more than 32,000 utility warrant submissions in the first 10 months of 2022. Campaigners shared information with the paper last month that showed more than 4,500 were granted because some courts chose to record the outcome. This week, the Scottish Parliament's social justice committee agreed to write to the Scottish government, the court service and energy firms to call for more transparency in how warrants were being dealt with. Its convener, SNP MSP Natalie Don, said she found the practice of forced entry to install pre-payment meters ""appalling"". She told the BBC: ""We are currently in the process of approaching a range of different stakeholders to try to find out what action can be taken, because I do think there could be more transparency around these warrants.  ""There is guidance, but I don't believe it's compulsory, and there could be improvements in the way that the system is carried out, in terms of notifying people when an application is made, a minimum period of notice, and checks on whether adequate efforts have been made to try and work with the people."" The Scottish government said legislative powers around utility warrants were reserved to Westminster, but it was aware of the ""dreadful impacts"" forced installation of pre-payment meters had on those in vulnerable circumstances. It said: ""How independent courts in Scotland consider applications for warrants made under the reserved law is a matter for the courts. ""It is vital that the UK government takes urgent steps to ensure that proper protections and safeguards are put in place to prevent a repeat of the disgraceful practices that have been reported this week. ""Meanwhile, we encourage all affected customers in need of help to contact Advice Direct Scotland."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-64518436
FTSE 100 closes at record high,"The FTSE 100 stock index has closed at a record high, lifted by investors betting that a weak pound will help UK firms abroad and that the worst of the cost of living crisis has passed. The index of the UK's biggest publicly listed companies gained more than 1%, to end the day at 7,901.8 points. That was the highest level in almost five years, passing the previous closing record set in May 2018. The milestone follows years of the UK lagging other big financial markets.  But the shares have benefited from a weaker pound.  That is because the index on the London Stock Exchange has many firms with big footprints overseas. A weak pound makes goods they export cheaper for foreign buyers and helps inflate the value of business done elsewhere.  The FTSE 250, which includes more domestically focused firms, has yet to return to its 2021 highs.   Such an emphatic bounceback in the value of our leading shares may seem surprising in the midst of an economic downturn. But it is what these companies do - and where they make their money - that counts.  The FTSE 100 is dominated by banking and energy companies, which have performed relatively well, the latter sharply boosted by higher oil and gas prices. And overall, the bulk of the money earned by companies on the index comes from overseas: earnings which rise in value when the pound falls against the dollar.  In fact, look at the value of the companies on the index in dollars, and it looks a relative bargain to some investors compared with many other stock markets. Adding to the optimism too are signs that price rises around the globe have peaked, so could be slowing soon - and so interest rates may soon do so as well, making borrowing cheaper and helping money flow more freely through the economy.  The renewed momentum in markets may be welcomed by investors - including holders of pension funds. But we're only five weeks into what could be another eventful year. A pound is worth about $1.21, 11% lower than a year ago, despite recent weakening in the dollar. Sterling is also down 6% against the Euro compared with a year ago. Analysts said shares were also buoyed by signs that the economic picture is brightening as inflation - the rate at which prices rise - shows signs of slowing across key global economies. AJ Bell markets analyst Russ Mould said: ""A lot of the [economic] news seems bad, but markets are saying that was priced in during 2022's heavy mid-year falls, and the bad news is known."" On Thursday, the Bank of England's Andrew Bailey said the recession in the UK was likely to be shorter and less severe than previously thought. He also hinted that UK interest rates could be nearing a peak. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it would only raise rates further if it sees evidence of more persistent pressure on the economy from rising prices. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said that after years of underperformance, the FTSE closing high was a significant moment for UK investors. He added that the market could reach new peaks in the coming weeks. ""Putting the current economic concerns aside, there's every reason to suppose if interest rates remain at current levels, that the FTSE 100 can push on further,"" he said.

Energy bills: Magistrate quits over force-fitting meter warrants,"A magistrate has said he quit after being left unable to check vulnerable people were being protected when energy firms sought warrants to force-fit prepayment meters. Robin Cantrill-Fenwick said changes to the court system meant magistrates ""were doing nothing more than rubber stamping"" warrants. He said the lack of scrutiny is putting vulnerable households at risk. Ofgem has told suppliers to suspend force-fitting pay-as-you-go meters.   The energy regulator made the announcement after The Times exposed how debt agents for British Gas had broken into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters. Ofgem has also opened an investigation into British Gas. Energy suppliers can apply to a court for a warrant to force-fit a prepayment meter for customers in arrears. However, they are required to have exhausted all other options first and should not do so for vulnerable customers such as the elderly and those with young children.  Mr Cantrill-Fenwick, a former Justice of the Peace, told BBC Newsnight: ""When I started, the energy companies would come to court and we would be able to question the applicant.  ""We could establish whether there might be young children in the premises or people who were clinically vulnerable. We could, and would sometimes, decline a warrant."" But in 2019, a new online and telephone application system for magistrates came into force. And while the number of warrant applications jumped the number of refusals plunged.  In 2019, warrant applications reached 278,966 and 1,824 refusals were granted, according to the Ministry of Justice. In 2022, applications for warrants hit 367,140 and there were just 56 refusals. ""Over time the process changed. Rather than looking at individual applications, we would just get a list of addresses,"" said Mr Cantrill-Fenwick. ""The person applying on behalf of the energy company would read out a template statement saying 'we've done our job' and there was nothing we could do."" Household energy bills have soared in recent months, firstly as economies reopened following Covid shutdowns and then as Russia's war in Ukraine caused disruption to global supplies. Higher energy prices have pushed up inflation which in the UK stood at 10.5% in December, close to a 40-year high. Mr Cantrill-Fenwick said: ""Energy companies are making far too many warrant applications when they should only be used very exceptionally."" Caroline Flint, former shadow energy secretary who now chairs the Committee on Fuel Poverty, said that while she would welcome a change in the law allowing forced installations: ""I think the courts need to look to themselves on this as well."" She said: ""From the reports that I've read, it does suggest that the information that is being given by the energy [firms] to the courts - which is to assure them that they have gone through the processes of trying to work with these families and showing due diligence - that due diligence hasn't been followed. ""I think there is a question about just how these warrants seem to be being waved through."" A spokesperson for the Judicial Office said: ""Magistrates deal with cases based on the evidence and the relevant legislation. The only applications that are dealt with in bulk are ones that are uncontested.  ""Individuals who wish to contest or challenge an application still have the opportunity to have their case considered by magistrates.  ""If an application is contested, the warrant will not be granted by the magistrate and the magistrate will list the case for a contested hearing to determine whether or not it should be granted."" Mr Cantrill-Fenwick, who is a member of the Liberal Democrats, had been a magistrate for six years before stepping down in August. ""If you are a person who is in acute financial distress and a court is going to consider granting power to enter your home, you want to know that the court has given it serious consideration, and none of that is true anymore,"" he said. ""I simply got to a point, I just couldn't imagine going into a court and putting my signature to one of those warrants. We were doing nothing more than rubber stamping."" A few months ago, Sarah (not her real name), who has long-term health problems and mobility issues, woke up in bed to the sound of men's voices. ""It was just terrible, I was so scared,"" she told Newsnight. ""I thought someone had broken in to take something. I went downstairs and there were two men in my living room and more outside."" The men were installing a prepayment meter on behalf of her energy company after she had fallen behind on her bills. ""Now even when the doors are locked, I don't feel like I'm safe,"" she said. ""I just think someone else is going to come into my house. It feels like it was invaded."" Sarah wanted to be anonymous because she doesn't want her energy company to know who she is so Newsnight has not been able to put her claims to them. She is also ashamed about how much she is struggling financially. ""I can't work because of my health problems and it's getting harder and harder to pay bills,"" she said. ""A lot of people may be in a good position income wise, but life doesn't always come that way for some. We don't deserve to have strangers come into our homes.""

Jobs growth surges in US despite slowdown fears,"Jobs growth surged in the US in January, defying fears that the economy is heading for a downturn.  Employers added 517,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said.  That was far more than expected, pushing the unemployment rate down to 3.4% - the lowest rate since 1969.  Analysts are struggling to figure out what is happening in the world's largest economy, which is being buffeted by a mix of higher borrowing costs and rising prices. Many forecasters have warned that the odds of a recession this year are unusually high, pointing to data which has indicated a recent pullback in consumer spending, declines in manufacturing and a sharp slowdown in home sales. A recent survey by research company Morning Consult suggested nearly half of the public thinks the economy has already fallen into recession, or a period of decline. Despite this, the labour market has remained strong - though the gains in January shocked even those economists who have argued against the gloomy predictions.  ""This is a breathtaking number,"" economist Justin Wolfers, a professor at the University of Michigan, wrote on Twitter following the report.  Dante DeAntonio, director at Moody's Analytics, cautioned against reading too much into a single month of data.   His firm still expects employment growth to slow ""dramatically"" in the months ahead, and warned that the probability of a recession remained ""uncomfortably high"". But US President Joe Biden, whose approval ratings dropped last year as prices surged - with Republicans blaming his spending plans - said the report showed his critics were wrong in their grim interpretations of the economy.  ""For the past two years we've heard a chorus of critics write off my economic plan,"" he said. ""Today's data makes crystal clear what I've always known in my gut - these critics and cynics are wrong."" The hiring in January was widespread, led by bars and restaurants, which are continuing to recover from job losses sparked by the pandemic.  The car manufacturing and tech industries were among the few parts of the economy to report job losses. Those sectors are sensitive to borrowing costs, which shot up last year, as the US central bank took steps to stabilise consumer prices. By raising interest rates, the Federal Reserve is aiming to cool demand, easing the pressures pushing up prices.  However, the increase in rates, coming at a time when price increases have started to ease, has raised fears that officials will tip the economy into a painful contraction, bringing economic activity to an abrupt slowdown that leads to firms to cutting jobs. The head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, said this week he was hopeful the US central bank can avoid that scenario. But he warned that the Fed was focused on curbing inflation and remained worried that the job market was too strong to allow price growth to stabilise around the bank's 2% target. Friday's report showed wages rose 4.4% over the 12 months to January. Pay increases did not keep pace with price inflation last year and have shown signs of cooling in recent months.  ""It's difficult to see how wage pressures can possibly soften sufficiently when jobs growth is as strong as this and it's even more difficult to see the Fed stop raising rates and entertain ideas of rate cuts when there is such explosive economic news coming in,"" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.  ""The market is going to go through a rollercoaster ride as it tries to decide if this is good or bad news. For now, though, looks like the US economy is doing absolutely fine.""

Great Yarmouth Marina Centre rebuild has boosted town - council,"The £26m rebuilding of a sports and leisure centre has helped increase footfall in a seaside town, a council's chief executive said. The Marina Centre, owned by Great Yarmouth Borough Council, reopened in August after closing down in October 2019. Since its opening it has attracted 150,000 visitors, Sheila Oxtoby, from the council, said. ""We have seen almost a 15% increase [in footfall] compared to 2019,"" she added. The old Marina Centre was demolished and a new facility was built on the seafront site, featuring a six-lane swimming pool as well as climbing walls, a gym, a sports hall, water slides, a learner pool and cafe. Ms Oxtoby said: ""The figures for last year compared to 2019, we can definitely see an increase [in footfall] once the Marina Centre opened in August as we moved into the 'shoulder season' - October, November, December, when footfall would normally fall away.  ""We have seen almost a 15% increase compared to 2019, and the fact we know almost 150,000 have used the centre and an additional 20,000 who've used the cafe, we absolutely believe it's driving the footfall."" Ms Oxtoby said the council-owned centre, run by Freedom Leisure, had been designed to be fun for adults and children, as well as be a serious sports centre. ""There's nothing else equivalent in Norfolk and I think people will travel [to it] because it's a great offer,"" she said. ""We believe it's doing exactly what we hoped it would do, as well as financially meeting our business case."" Asa Morrison, chief executive of Visit Great Yarmouth, said: ""Anytime you put something on the seafront that is weather tolerant, it helps the footfall on the seafront."" He said the centre was a ""positive development"" and the redevelopment of the empty Winter Gardens would only help further.  Sandie Menezes has been the owner of the Beach Hut cafe for eight years and said opening each winter had been a ""struggle sometimes"".  ""But now we are noticing more footfall, getting busier through the winter time as there's more cafes opening up and there's more choice for people,"" she said. ""I think out of the seven cafes [north of the Britannia pier], six are now open all winter, which is great because it brings people down.""  Jamie Jones, owner of Magic City amusement arcade and Merlin's Sports Bar, said: ""We've seen larger footfall, especially in our sports bar, with snooker players and people watching live sports, and hopefully it's a sign of things to come for 2023.  ""The level of investment that's gone on the Marina Centre can only be good for the seafront and hopefully it benefits all the other businesses along it as well."" Mark Allen, owner of Munchies cafe on North Drive, said: ""We've stayed open for the winter for the first time this year because we've taken on somebody as a manager to give me a little bit more spare time, and of course we've got to employ year-round.  ""However, it's been quite successful.  ""It's great to hear more people are coming into town and using it [the Marina Centre] and anything like that is going to be good for the town.""

Energy bills: What can I do if I can't afford to pay?,"Energy prices have soared, leaving many people worried about how to pay their bills.  Some of those struggling have been forced onto more expensive prepayment meters. If you don't agree a payment plan with your supplier, they might try to force you to have prepayment meter installed, or they may switch your existing smart meter to prepayment mode. This has proved controversial. The energy regulator, Ofgem, is reviewing the way prepayment meters operate. In very rare cases, if you haven't paid a bill after 28 days, you might be threatened with disconnection, but you'll normally be offered a meter first. Your supplier must give you a chance to clear your debt through a payment plan before activating a prepayment meter.  If you've reached state pension age, your supplier can't disconnect you between 1 October and 31 March if you either: Suppliers can pass your details to a debt collection agency - and you might be charged more to cover the cost of this. Many suppliers also charge extra fees for late payments. Paying by direct debit is normally the cheapest way to pay for electricity and gas. Cancelling a direct debit means your future bills are likely to be higher. Finally, not paying bills could damage your credit rating, and make it harder to borrow money in the future. There are more than four million UK households on prepayment meters.  Under the rules: However, an investigation by the Times newspaper found debt agents acting for British Gas had wrongly broken into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters.  Ofgem has asked all suppliers to review the use of court warrants to enter the homes of customers in arrears. Check your direct debit Your monthly payment is based on your estimated energy use for the year, and your supplier may reduce your bill if its estimate is higher than the amount you actually use, so check. You can also request a flexible monthly direct debit where you pay for what you actually use each month. This requires a smart meter or regular readings. But two-thirds of gas usage is during the winter months, and prices have risen sharply, so in the short term this could mean your bill is higher. Pay what you can If the direct debit is fair, but you can't meet it, ask your supplier for an ""able to pay plan"" based on what you can afford.  By paying something every month - even if it's less than the amount due - your arrears will grow more slowly, meaning your supplier may be less worried about your debt.  You may also wish to get your name added to the Priority Services Register (PSR), a list of households which should get extra support.  Those eligible include pensioners, those who are pregnant or who have young children, or people who are disabled.  Your supplier can also get your name added to the network operator register if necessary. Ofgem recommends doing this if you rely on your energy supply for medical reasons.  If you have a different supplier for your gas and electricity, you need to contact them both. Being on the PSR doesn't cancel your arrears. But it does show that you are vulnerable, which your supplier should take into account.  Claim what you are entitled to Check you are claiming all the benefits you can. The independent MoneyHelper website has a useful guide, while Policy in Practice and the charities Entitledto and Turn2us run benefits calculators. You may also be able to repay your debt directly from your benefits through the government's Fuel Direct scheme. A number of suppliers and charities also offer grants to help with bills.  Check you're getting extra government help The government has announced a range of support to help people with energy bills, including a £400 grant for all UK households, paid in instalments between October 2022 and March 2023. Norther Ireland households are getting a single payment of £600 from January. It is more because so many homes use heating oil. Adjust your boiler If you have a combi boiler at home - you don't have a hot water cylinder and there is a (usually white) plastic pipe under the boiler - you may wish to consider turning down the heating flow temperature.  On the front - sometimes behind a flap - look for a dial or set of buttons with a radiator icon. Turn the dial to the number three, or the 12 o'clock position. If it has a digital display, select 60C.  You may also want to turn off the hot water pre-heat. Many boilers come on every few hours - night and day - to ensure there's always some hot water available.  Most homes don't need this, and turning it off saves money.

A wave of tool theft spurs hi-tech security systems,"It was his van alarm that woke him up. At 2:30 in the morning.  As carpenter Derek (not his real name), who lives in the Midlands, raced downstairs and out to his front garden, he heard the thieves making their getaway into the night. Derek has had his tools stolen more than a dozen times in his career, he says. Once, criminals struck in broad daylight while he was unloading his van at a job. ""They actually told me that if I was to call the police on them, they would come back and kill my family,"" he recalls. ""You don't sleep then for the next couple of days, you're panicking about them coming back again."" The burglary in the middle of the night, last autumn, felt like the last straw. As Derek totted up the value of the stolen tools - £7,000's worth, he estimates - despair hit. Was it even worth carrying on with carpentry, the job he'd done since he left school? ""I was ready to jack it in,"" he says. Tool theft is a shockingly common crime. According to insurer Direct Line, a tool is stolen from a tradesperson every 17 minutes in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Those affected say it is much more than an inconvenience. Insurance claims can be complicated and don't always cover the cost. You might lose days or even weeks of trade while sourcing replacement kit. And it can affect your mental health.  But there is technology out there designed to help prevent tool theft, or at least reduce the hassle should it happen. When Devin Chawda and Stephen Holland showed off a security camera they had developed at a trade show a few years ago, builders and electricians kept asking them if it was something they could put inside their van.  That's why they founded ARMD, a firm that specialises in anti-tool theft tech and insurance. ""In the event someone breaks in, you instantly get alerted, you can take action, you can record, you can alert the police,"" says Mr Chawda on Zoom as his fellow co-founder Mr Holland holds up the small motion sensor and location tracker designed for commercial vehicles. There's a separate hub containing a SIM card that can be hidden in the front of the van. It connects the system to a mobile network. If someone unplugs the hub, that triggers an automated phone call alerting the owner. Still, the tech isn't necessarily enough, suggests Mr Holland.  ""To get them back to work became our mission,"" he says, as he explains how in late 2021 ARMD launched an insurance product designed specifically for tradespeople. The coverage is linked to a special smartphone app. It is a digital inventory of every valuable bit of equipment a plumber or builder might have and displays the insurance claim value of each tool. For a new tool, this figure starts at 100% of its retail value and reduces each year by 10%, down to a minimum of 50%, says Mr Chawda. Crucially, ARMD aims to pay out genuine claims as quickly as possible. The firm has about 80 customers signed up so far and has settled 7 claims in total. The longest of those took just three days. There are alternative technologies designed to help combat the effects of tool theft.  A tool inventory app called The Tool Register, available for smartphones, was listed in a research briefing on tool theft published by the House of Commons Library last year, for example.  A spokesman for uWatch, which makes the app, says it has about 500 users. uWatch also offers a security device called The Cube, fitted with a camera as well as motion and location sensors among others. ""There are members who are literally putting cages inside their vehicles,"" says Darren Crannis, technical manager at the Electrical Contractors' Assocation (ECA), which represents 3,000 member companies covering a total of 27,000 individual tradespeople. Some even choose to put fake logos on their vans, obscuring that they are in a building trade, hiding the fact there could be tools in the vehicle, he says. Tradespeople may also install covert cameras in vans, apply forensic marking products such as microdots to their tools, and label them as protected, for example. And there's a range of heavy duty locks, vaults and alarm systems to secure equipment whether it is kept in a van or a shed, for instance. ""Have you seen the most recent James Bond where only he can hold his gun and it works?"" says Mr Crannis. ""That really would be brilliant."" Some real-world tech does, actually, come close. Tool brand Milwaukee, for instance, launched a system called One-key in 2016. It uses sensors clipped onto, or built inside, tools that link to a tradesperson's smartphone via Bluetooth. You can choose to set up a geofence, a specific area on a map, so that if a tool is taken outside that area, an alert pops up. From there, you can track the tools, but only if they come into the range of a phone with the app installed. Milwaukee says it has around 400,000 users across Europe, whose smartphones provide a kind of patchwork of detectors dotted around the continent. It is also possible to disable some Milwaukee tools remotely, meaning they won't work until recovered and reactivated. The firm is developing versions of its tracking devices for removable tool batteries as well, since large batteries can sometimes cost hundreds of pounds. ""If the technology's there, we need to start using it,"" says Andy Hartley, key account manager for building firm GCL, and south east regional chairman at the ECA. He recalls working on one job site in London where he estimates tools were repeatedly stolen - on between 10 and 15 occasions. But how far will any of this help if demand for stolen tools remains high? ""It's indicative of a market within the building industry that is rife. Where are these tools going?"" says Brian Berry, chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders. He suggests that licensing or tighter regulation of building companies could help. More technology of business: Tradespeople who spoke to the BBC suggested that tool theft was commonly reported to the police, but that prosecutions or successful recoveries of stolen tools were extremely rare. A spokesman for the National Police Chiefs Council said: ""There are complexities in tool theft cases as there are limited forensic opportunities. We will continue to work hard to prevent tool theft and encourage victims to report these instances to police."" In Derek's case, he reported last year's burglary immediately. He hasn't heard anything since, however. The incident was nearly enough to end his carpentry business, but friends encouraged him to keep going. However, he still hasn't been able to cover the cost of replacing all the tools taken in the last burglary. ""It's like starting from scratch,"" he says.

Google launches ChatGPT rival called Bard,"Google is launching an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered chatbot called Bard to rival ChatGPT.  Bard will be used by a group of testers before being rolled out to the public in the coming weeks, the firm said. Bard is built on Google's existing large language model Lamda, which one engineer described as being so human-like in its responses that he believed it was sentient. The tech giant also announced new AI tools for its current search engine.  AI chatbots are designed to answer questions and find information. ChatGPT is the best-known example. They use what's on the internet as an enormous database of knowledge although there are concerns that this can also include offensive material and disinformation.  ""Bard seeks to combine the breadth of the world's knowledge with the power, intelligence, and creativity of our large language models,"" wrote Google boss Sundar Pichai in a blog. Mr Pichai stressed that he wanted Google's AI services to be ""bold and responsible"" but did not elaborate on how Bard would be prevented from sharing harmful or abusive content. The platform will initially operate on a ""lightweight"" version of Lamda, requiring less power so that more people can use it at once, he said. Google's announcement follows wide speculation that Microsoft is about to bring the AI chatbot ChatGPT to its search engine Bing, following a multi-billion dollar investment in the firm behind it, OpenAI.  ChatGPT can answer questions and carry out requests in text form, based on information from the internet as it was in 2021. It can generate speeches, songs, marketing copy, news articles and student essays. It is currently free for people to use, although it costs the firm a few pennies each time somebody does. OpenAI recently announced a subscription tier to complement free access. But the ultimate aim of chatbots lies in internet search, experts believe - replacing pages of web links with one definitive answer.  Sundar Pichai said that people are using Google search to ask more nuanced questions than previously.  Whereas, for example, a common question about the piano in the past may have been how many keys it has, now it is more likely to be whether it is more difficult to learn than the guitar - which does not have an immediate factual answer. ""AI can be helpful in these moments, synthesizing insights for questions where there's no one right answer,"" he wrote.  ""Soon, you'll see AI-powered features in Search that distil complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats, so you can quickly understand the big picture and learn more from the web.""

"Facebook's parent firm Meta can be sued by ex-moderator, judge rules","A worker who alleges reviewing graphic social media posts harmed his mental health can sue Facebook owner Meta, a Kenyan labour court says. Daniel Motaung claims he was paid about $2.20 (£1.80) per hour to review posts including beheadings and child abuse. He is also suing his then employer Sama, which Meta had contracted to review posts. Meta argued that the court had no jurisdiction because the company is not based in Kenya, Reuters reported. But the court disagreed and found that Meta and Sama were ""proper parties"" to the case. Meta declined to comment, but legal campaign group Foxglove expected it to appeal. In 2020, Meta paid $52m to settle a case brought by US content moderators over mental health issues which they said they developed on the job. The Kenyan case is supported by Foxglove, whose director Cori Crider said that a key point had been established: ""Daniel's win today should send a message to Facebook, and by proxy, all of big tech in Africa.  ""Kenyan justice is equal to any tech giant, and the giants would do well to wake up and respect Kenyan people - and their law."" Facebook employs thousands of moderators to review content flagged by users or artificial intelligence systems to see if it violates the platform's community standards, and to remove it if necessary. Mr Motaung said the first graphic video he saw was ""a live video of someone being beheaded"". He told the BBC in May 2022 that he suffers flashbacks where he imagines he is the victim. Mr Motaung, who says he has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, believes that his co-workers also struggled with the content they had to view. ""I would see people walking off the production floor to cry, you know, that type of thing,"" he said. Mr Motaung was recruited from South Africa to work for Sama in Nairobi, where much of the moderation for East and South Africa was handled.  He claims the support given to moderators was inadequate. Sama has called his accusations ""both disappointing and inaccurate"", arguing that it provided all members of its workforce with a competitive wage, benefits, upward mobility, and a robust mental health and wellness programme. The firm has since ended its moderation work for Meta.  Meta has previously declined to comment directly on the legal action, but has said it requires partners ""to provide industry-leading pay, benefits and support"". Campaigners say Monday's court ruling could have significance for other cases they are attempting to bring. In December, a case, also backed by Foxglove, was launched in Kenya, alleging Facebook's algorithm helped fuel the viral spread of hate and violence during Ethiopia's civil war. The case asks the court to require the creation of a $2bn fund for victims of hate on Facebook and changes to the platform's algorithm. Meta said that hate speech and incitement to violence were against the platform's rules, and says it invests heavily in moderation and tech to remove such content. It told the BBC: ""We employ staff with local knowledge and expertise and continue to develop our capabilities to catch violating content in the most widely spoken languages in the country, including Amharic, Oromo, Somali and Tigrinya.""

'Google killer' ChatGPT sparks AI chatbot race,"It has been two months since the public launch of AI chatbot ChatGPT by the firm OpenAI - and it did not take long for people to start noticing what a game-changer this really is. Whether you have asked it to write you a song in the style of your favourite musician, sneaked in a homework question (500 words on the end of World War Two? no problem), tasked it to write copy for your company website, write a speech or even churn out specific program code, ChatGPT has proved that it can deliver - and in a convincing way.  There has been acres of reporting about its potential threat to a wide range of jobs, and indeed to our entire model of education if students can get their coursework done and university applications written instantly via ChatGPT or its rivals. That said - this tech is still, comparatively, in its infancy. It is text only, restricted to content from the internet as it was in 2021, and does not update. It presents its answers as fact, when as we know the net is full of misinformation, some of it more dangerous than others. We tried to get it to write an article for the BBC website, and the journalist who worked on it said it needed lots of prompting and revisions before there was something even close to being of a quality we might publish. In the end it still was not good enough, so we didn't.  Our journalist said although it churned out copy quickly, the process itself became very time-consuming because he had to keep going back to it and specifically asking it to explain more about one thing, or focus less on another.  But the creators of ChatGPT have a far more lucrative goal in mind than simply taking my job. The bigger picture is the multi-billion dollar sector that is internet search. And that is why it has been dubbed the Google killer. Google's parent company Alphabet made $104bn (£86bn) in revenue in 2020 alone, just from search. Taking even a tiny fraction of that market would be a huge prize - and it is no coincidence that Microsoft, which owns the search engine Bing, has announced a multi-billion dollar partnership with OpenAI. The internet is full of supposedly leaked pictures of a ChatGPT-powered Bing. Imagine going to a search engine, typing in your query and back comes one definitive answer, rather than pages and pages of links (and ads) to wade through?  My contacts at Microsoft are staying tight-lipped, but we do know it is due to announce some news this week.  Google has just announced the launch of its own rival - an AI chatbot called Bard. It is understood to have brought the announcement forward following all the speculation about Microsoft and ChatGPT. Bard is based on Google's language learning model Lamda, which is said to be so human-like in its responses that one engineer who worked on it said he believed it was sentient (he was fired, and Google has always denied the claim). The tech giant has also just announced a $300m investment in a firm called Anthropic, which is developing a rival to ChatGPT.  Meta, which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, launched its own AI chatbot Blenderbot in the US last summer. Are we about to see a battle of the chatbots? ChatGPT itself said, rather diplomatically, that ""it is not a matter of one being 'better' than the other"" when I asked it which was best. ""I do not have the capability or intention to harm any company, including Google,"" it added. But with investment dollars pouring into AI chat, it may well be that ChatGPT has to toughen up on that particular viewpoint. Not that it has one, of course. Yet.

Commissioner warns rape victims 'forced to choose between healthcare and justice',"Rape victims are being forced to choose between healthcare and justice, Northern Ireland's victims of crime commissioner has said.  Geraldine Hanna said victims were asked to consent to ""excessive"" personal data being handed over during trials, including counselling notes. The victims of crime commissioner focusses on victims' needs. Ms Hanna, the first person to hold the role, was appointed by then-Justice Minister Naomi Long in June. In Northern Ireland, victims of serious sexual assault may be referred to counselling.  However, the police, prosecution, or defence may request access to their counselling records and the victim may be questioned about them in court.  Ms Hanna said she was concerned that this was putting some victims off accessing crucial support or causing them to censor their words in counselling, ""for fear of how it may be used against them"".  Speaking at the beginning of Sexual Violence Week, she said it was crucial victims of rape and sexual violence felt safe to report crimes and to work confidentially to process trauma. ""One of my key priorities is to strengthen the protection afforded to victims' personal data including the disclosure of counselling notes,"" she said. ""I am deeply concerned that the disclosure of third-party counselling notes in rape and sexual assault trials is forcing victims to choose between accessing healthcare and accessing justice.""   A recent report by the Information Commissioner (ICO) outlined recommendations for police and prosecuting authorities to tighten the safeguards governing access to a victim's personal data.   Ms Hanna is engaging with the legal profession, victim support organisations, the public prosecution service, the PSNI, and counselling organisations to explore proposals to restrict or wholly exclude counselling notes from criminal trials.  Joanne Barnes, chief executive of Nexus NI, which supports people affected by sexual trauma told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster that the charity receives requests for clients' counselling notes on a daily basis. ""In the last year, Nexus has taken the decision that only in two circumstances do we issue case notes for clients, that's to the client directly... or under court order,"" she said. ""We've had to take this action to try and strengthen the confidentiality, respect and dignity that our clients deserve. No-one should have to make a choice between justice or their health."" Marie Brown, Foyle Women's Aid, told BBC Radio Foyle that she had seen ""time and time again"" people being let down by the process or watching others' experiences and thinking, ""this is not worth it"".  ""If someone goes to counselling, it should be a confidential service in which they give their inner-most thoughts,"" she said. The Public Prosecution Service (PPS) said all victims of a sexual offence should feel confident that they can receive therapeutic care without surrendering their right to privacy. ""We in the PPS appreciate the deep and complex sensitivities around victims having their personal information accessed for the purpose of a criminal trial,"" Ciaran McQuillan, head of the PPS Serious Crime Unit, said. ""As prosecutors, we have a duty to apply the law and to ensure the overarching obligation of a fair trial. Part of ensuring that fair trial is complying with our duty of disclosure."" Mr McQuillan said the PPS would only ask police to seek material from third parties when it was a reasonable line of enquiry. PSNI Superintendent Lindsay Fisher said police welcomed the opportunity to work collaboratively ""to ensure that we are best supporting victims of sexual offences and delivering effectively"".  UK Information Commissioner John Edwards said: ""The important work by Commissioner Designate Geraldine Hanna for victims of crime in Northern Ireland, alongside broader work across the UK, is vital to making progress to prevent victims feeling as though they are being treated as suspects.""

Tech lay-offs: Dell to cut workforce,"Dell is to lay off about 6,650 workers because of the decline in demand for personal computers. The job cuts are expected to affect about 5% of its global workforce.  The company faced tough market conditions with an uncertain future and its previous cost-cutting measures were no longer enough, co-chief operating officer Jeff Clarke wrote in a memo. Dell, based in Round Rock, Texas, announced similar lay-offs in 2020, after the pandemic hit. The latest department reorganisations and job cuts were an opportunity to drive efficiency, a company representative said. ""We continuously evaluate operations to ensure the right structure is in place to provide the best value and support to partners and customers.  ""This is part of our regular course of business,"" a Dell spokesperson told the BBC. Lay-offs in the US hit a more than two-year high in January, as the technology industry, once a reliable source of employment, cut jobs at the second-highest pace on record - to brace for a possible recession, a report showed on Thursday. Companies including Google, Amazon and Meta are now grappling with how to balance cost-cutting measures with the need to remain competitive, as consumer and corporate spending shrinks amid high inflation and rising interest rates, after the pandemic.   Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said recent job cuts had been ""the most difficult changes we've made in Meta's history"", while Twitter cut about half its staff after multi-billionaire Elon Musk took control, in October.

'Investing in the artist makes me feel more involved in the song',"You might not have heard of an electronic music artist called Alan Walker, but he has a significant fanbase. On YouTube the video of one of his songs, Faded, has been played 3.5 billon times, and he has 42.9 million subscribers on the platform. It is a similar picture on Spotify, where the Anglo-Norwegian music producer and DJ has numerous songs that have been listened to hundreds of millions of times. While bands and other musical artists have long argued that the streaming services do not pay them enough, Walker, who also earns money from live performances, has amassed a net worth estimated to be as high as $20m (£16m).  For the music industry the fans are normally just the consumers - they pay to listen to the songs and albums, attend the concerts, and buy the merchandise. But last year Walker decided that he would start to allow his fanbase to share in his financial success. He has done this by giving around 8,000 fans the opportunity to invest in four of his singles, sharing with them his streaming revenues. To facilitate this, Walker has used a new Swedish website and app called Corite, which handles all the financial details, including the collection and exchanges of funds. New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. ""I wanted to involve my fans beyond just connecting with them on the stage and through my music,"" Walker tells the BBC. ""We have raised just above $100,000 [from fans] in our projects so far, but this number is not what makes me tick. ""It's the thousands of backers that have participated in my projects that will now share the success with me."" Stockholm-based Corite is the brainchild of music industry veteran Mattias Tengblad, who was previously commercial director for industry giant Universal Music Group. The idea behind Corite is that up and coming artists can skip signing with record labels - which typically make more money from a successful artist, than the artist make themselves. Under Corite's model, artists secure financial backing from their, hopefully, growing fanbase. In return, fans can hope to earn more money than the sum they have invested. Although it is important to stress that they can lose money. The way it works is that an artist announces a ""campaign"" via Corite, typically the forthcoming release of a single. They then detail how much money they are seeking to raise, from just $500 up to tens of thousands, and how much profit they will give to each investor if the song is streamed a certain number of times over the first year of its release. Typically the rates of return are between 1.4 and 1.7 times the amount a person invests. So if you put in $10 at 1.7, and the song reaches its one-year listening target you'd get back a minimum of $17. And if the song greatly exceeds its streaming target, the investors will get even more earnings. However, it is a gamble, as if the song flops, and doesn't hit its goal, then the investors won't recoup as much money as they put in. Instead they may only get a few pounds or even just pennies back. To help people decide whether a song is worth investing in, they can listen to a 30-second snippet via the Corite site.  When the song is ready to release in full, Corite uploads it to all the streaming services, and collects and distributes the revenues to the artists and the fan investors. ""We are challenging the status quo in the music industry,"" says Mr Tengblad.  ""Corite lets music lovers invest in the music that they love, and artists that they love, and get a piece of the success when songs are streaming on the likes of Spotify and Apple. ""For the artists it can be a cheaper way of funding your career than signing an expensive deal with a record label, that is going to take a much higher slice of their earnings. And even when a record company has all the best intentions in the world, nowadays the social media world has made promotion much more complicated. ""Record labels don't know how to make things happen anymore, and instead artists can use Corite to unleash the power of their fans, who with money invested will become even more vocal cheerleaders. Yet at the end of the day you still need good songs to be successful."" But can artists really succeed without the support of a record label?  Jeremy Lascelles has been a music industry executive for more than 50 years. Today he is the co-founder and chief executive of Blue Raincoat Music, which combines a record label, with artist management, and music publishing arm. He says that record companies still have a very important role to play. ""The digital age has certainly shifted the power away from record labels, but they are still a very attractive proposition for artists. They still have access to quite considerable capital and funding, they have marketing muscle, and they have access to media, to radio, TV and the like. ""So when an artist releases a single or album, you have an army of people at the record label there to help it be successful. Doing all that on your own is far more difficult."" One Alan Walker fan who has invested in one of his 2022 singles is student Effie Sampson, who is doing a degree in games design at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston.  She invested $35, and has so far got back $19.13. However, Ms Sampson says it isn't about the money. ""I did it to support an artist that I love,"" she says. ""And you feel more involved in the song when you listen to it."" It is this sense of closer involvement that business psychologist Stuart Duff, a partner at UK practice Pearn Kandola, thinks might be key to Corite's future success. ""While the financial transaction may be important, of much greater value is the way that the investment will strengthen the relationship between the artist and fans,"" he says. ""Without even realising it, the artist is creating a stronger psychological bond with the fans."" Alan Walker says that for him, using Corite, and allowing fans to join in his financial success, ""offers me a way of giving back to the community of 'Walkers', and showing my appreciation of what we've built together"".

"Andrew Tate was violent and coercive, says ex-girlfriend","A British woman who says she was in a relationship with controversial social media influencer Andrew Tate has told the BBC how he encouraged her to work for his webcam company, before becoming controlling and violent. ""It's very difficult because I don't feel like a victim - all of the choices I made were of my [own] free will. He didn't bundle me up into a bag, throw me in the back of a lorry and drive me there,"" says Sophie.  ""But he knew what he was doing. At what point does the emotional or psychological manipulation turn into being forced to do something?"" Andrew Tate - and his brother Tristan - are in custody in Romania while police investigate allegations of rape and trafficking.  Prosecutors allege the pair recruited victims by seducing them and falsely claiming they wanted to have a relationship - which police have dubbed ""the lover-boy method"". Victims were then forced or manipulated into working in their adult entertainment chat rooms. Sophie, not her real name, says this is exactly what happened to her. She is now helping prosecutors with their investigation. She told BBC Radio 4 programme File on 4 that Tate approached her ""completely out of the blue"" on Facebook and was very charming. ""He was sort of luring me into believing that he was somebody that I could trust and someone that genuinely wanted to build a connection with me,"" she explains.  She says their exchanges were typical of people getting to know each other with no red flags. After talking to him online she agreed to travel to his home in the Romanian capital, Bucharest. ""I was at a stage of my life where everything felt a bit boring and a bit dull and this idea of an adventure just seemed attractive,"" she explains.  As their relationship developed, Sophie regularly visited Tate in Romania. He told her he wanted her to be his girlfriend, but soon began asking her to work for him. ""A couple of times he'd said to me, 'You should do it, you'd make a fortune, but you don't have to if you don't want to do it. I make enough money,'"" Sophie says. ""But he was always reminding me that the option was there and that progressed into, 'If you love me, you would do it. If you care about me, you would do it… we can make all this money'. And over time, just chipping away at me, eventually he led me to think, 'Maybe he's right, maybe I should be doing it'."" Sophie had worked in the adult entertainment industry before, so she was open to the suggestion. But she says she felt coerced and worried that if she refused, she might lose him. In a now-deleted page on his website, Tate describes how he operated his webcam business - his account chimes with Sophie's in many ways.  He describes his job as, ""To meet a girl, go on a few dates, sleep with her… get her to fall in love with me, to where she'd do anything I say."" The video continues, ""And then get her on web-cam so we could become rich together."" In the decade he says he has been running his studio, he claims more than half of his employees were his girlfriends and none were in the adult entertainment industry before they met him. Sophie's account contradicts this. Sophie says she earned around £800 for six hours' work, from which Tate would take 50%. Representatives of the industry in Romania told the BBC this was not unusual for webcam studios. Over time, Sophie says Tate's behaviour towards her worsened. She claims he became increasingly controlling, imposing cash fines if she went out without his permission, and that he became violent. ""There was some disagreement… he held me up against the wall and he slapped me really hard and followed it with 'you whore,'"" she says. She added that rough sex turned into something she had not consented to. ""Most of the violence was sexual, that's obviously something that he's into. He likes to feel completely in control of the woman and feel like he could take their life away at any second. That is a big sexual turn on for him,"" she explains. ""I was so intent on just wanting to please him and just wanting him to be happy. But looking back on it, he used to strangle me, to the point where I passed out once and I think he panicked then because he knew he'd gone too far."" The BBC has seen messages and listened to voice recordings sent to Sophie from Tate that appear to support her claims of controlling behaviour. Sophie says she eventually left the relationship after having a moment of clarity that ""constantly feeling inferior to him"" was not right. ""I realised I couldn't live like that anymore and that it wasn't normal. I just had to get away from it,"" she explains. ""I remember being at work and I was just so overwhelmed and I'd never felt a darkness like it."" She describes Tate as a ""very complex man"" who was quite different to the character he presented online - where he is known for his high-volume rants, often filmed while smoking a cigar or surrounded by his supercars. ""He's very manipulative, he totally lacks any kind of empathy. He is a narcissist, he's like that 100%,"" she says. ""I don't think he's emotionally capable of feeling love, for anyone or anything, even his family, even his brother - there's just nothing. In the space in our brains where we feel love and compassion and empathy… [in his] it's just a hole, there's nothing there."" The BBC put these allegations to Tate through his lawyer, but Mateea Petrescu, who handles media requests for the Tate brothers, said they would not comment on the claims.  Investigators in Romania have confirmed that six women have been identified as potential victims of trafficking. But last month, two of the women publicly denied any mistreatment by the Tate brothers, while other women have spoken positively to the BBC about their time spent with Tate. But Sophie says some of these are women who Tate genuinely treated well,  while others are still under his control. ""He's always one step ahead,"" she says. ""He will be mindful of the fact he needs as many glowing reviews as he does negative ones in order to defend himself.  ""Equally, there are going to be girls that will be so infatuated and brainwashed by him that they are never going to say a bad word. There will also be some that are speaking out of fear because he's threatening."" Police have not yet filed any charges against the brothers, who have been in detention, along with two Romanian women, since 29 December. They have denied the allegations against them.

Gwynedd: Robot sailboat invention to get sea weather data,"A self-sailing robot boat that can predict the weather has been built by a pair of 23-year-old inventors.  Anahita Laverack and her business partner Ciaran Dowds, who live together on a boat in Caernarfon, Gwynedd, raised £100,000 to fund the project. They hope it will change the game in our understanding of the relationship between the sea and weather. The money raised means they can build a total of 10 craft to capture data from the waves. Ms Laverack said: ""The ocean has a huge impact on our weather systems, yet we don't have enough information about what's happening."" The vessel, called Oshen, is 1.2m (3.9ft) long, weighs 50kg (110lb) and can collect data without human help. London-born Ms Laverack moved to Wales to pursue her ambition of putting her invention to use, and said she believes she is in the best location to make it a success.  ""It's a nicer place to be a small start-up company,"" she said. ""People are more likely to help you here, because it's a small community,"" she said. ""And as a small business, you need a bit of help."" Even if the firm expands she plans to stay in Wales. ""We have everything we need here,"" she said.  ""I'm not sure what we'll need in the future that Caernarfon can't provide."" She hoped her work would transform industries like shipping and defence that need information about the sea.  The current reliance on plastic buoys for data, she said, had to change.  ""There are currently over 1,000 drifting buoys out there, but they're unsustainable,"" she said.  Ms Laverack has won a young innovator award for her work, £5,000 to develop the project and an allowance to cover living costs. Cash has also come from the European Space Agency. The pair have tested Oshen in waters including Cardigan Bay, near Aberystwyth, in Ceredigion, and Llyn Padarn, Gwynedd. The plan is to do testing further out in the Atlantic Ocean by the end of 2023. She has her fingers crossed for success. ""It'll be a world technological first if we do it,"" she said. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64513207
Farewell radiators? Testing out electric infrared wallpaper,"Look carefully and you will notice there is something slightly different about Kris Bilski's house in Hull. It has no radiators. Yet even on a -2C winter's day, it's nice and warm inside. This is because Kris is an early adopter of electric infrared wallpaper. Thin, metallic sheets are hidden behind the plaster of his walls, which are connected to the mains electricity of his house. These sheets emit heat by infrared waves.  Radiators in a central heating system heat rooms by what is known as convection heating, warming up the air in rooms, which then circulates.  This infrared technique warms up solid objects in the room directly, including us humans. It also means you can easily choose to heat only one room at a time, using an app. Why also heat the bedroom, for example, when you are going to be watching Happy Valley in the sitting room for the next few hours? Kris, 31, runs a video production company and lives at the property with his wife. He heard about the technology through a colleague, and as a tech enthusiast he decided to become an early adopter.  He ripped out his gas-powered radiators before fitting the wallpaper. At the moment the new method of heating his home isn't any cheaper, but he plans to install solar panels on his roof to power the wallpaper, which he thinks will make his home greener, and save him money, in the long term. ""It makes me happy that I don't rely on gas,"" says Kris. ""It's a new technology that should help us as a country."" The wallpaper system that he is using was made by a local firm called iHelios. As well as being available for private installation, the company is currently trialling the technology with landlords that provide social housing in Hull, and also housing groups in Wales. These organisations want to save money and meet green targets.  Around 23 million homes are currently connected to the gas grid in the UK. But the government wants all homes in the UK to have phased out gas-fired boilers by 2035. Homes currently account for about 17% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions, and this fossil fuel-based way of heating our homes is responsible for much of it. As well as not requiring gas, electric wallpaper is also thought to produce better air quality in properties. It doesn't dry out the air so much and generates less mould, for instance around windows. Poor air quality has been linked to health problems in some social housing properties.  Philip Steele is future technologies evangelist at Octopus Energy. Part of his job is to test out new gadgets, and he has been looking at another version of the wallpaper, made by British company Nexgen Heating . ""Electric wallpaper is a really good way of heating your home,"" he says.  ""It has two copper strips down each side of it and then a graphene layer, and when it's powered [with electricity] the graphene emits infrared, which is like the heat you get from the sun."" The graphene material he refers to is a thin layer of carbon atoms that can conduct electricity, first discovered by researchers at Manchester University. The version in Hull, which has also been used in other parts of Europe, like Scandinavia, uses a carbon paste layer to similar effect. With the aid of a thermal-imaging camera you can see the hidden wallpaper, warming up and in turn heating up other objects in the room. It can heat objects within a range of about 2 to 3 metres. Of course homes also need hot water for washing up and showers. In homes that use exclusively electric wallpaper, this can be provided by an electric immersion heater. So is this potentially a greener and cheaper way to heat our homes? Dr Tina Fawcett of the University of Oxford's Environmental Change Institute is not so sure. ""It could certainly be greener, especially as we use more renewables [like solar and wind power] to generate electricity,"" she says. Currently gas is used to generate a significant proportion of our electricity supply. ""But I think the running costs could be quite high, as electricity costs three to four times as much as gas,"" she says. She points out that air source heat pumps are a more efficient way to use electricity to heat the home. However, these pumps come with higher upfront costs than electric wallpaper and are not always straightforward to install - there can be issues with planning permission, for instance.  Some versions of the electric wallpaper, on the other hand, can be fitted while a tenant is still living in the property, making refurbishment easier. An electric wallpaper system would cost around £4,000 to install in a typical three-bedroom home, according to Nexgen Heating, a British manufacturer of the paper. However, you also need to factor in the costs of removing the existing central heating system and investing in an electric immersion heater for hot water. In comparison, an air source heat pump would cost on average around £8,000 to install in a typical three-bedroom home, according to Octopus Energy, though depending on your type of property and the area where you live, it could be significantly more. However, you may be entitled to a £5,000 grant towards that from the government. In some cases you may also need to invest in bigger radiators to make the system work. New-builds, of course, can be purpose-built for these systems. The housebuilder Redrow recently announced it will switch to air source heat pumps in its new developments, while Barratt has trialled electric wallpaper in its show homes. Individual homeowners as well as councils, providers of social housing and developers will have to take all these factors into account. This infrared, electric wallpaper technology may not be particularly glamorous or visible - but it could potentially have a big impact on the UK's carbon footprint and ability to meet climate targets.

Andrew Tate: Inside the Romanian town where brothers' empire began,"The villa at the end of Strada Narciselor sits at the end of a perilous road, surrounded by the fir-covered peaks of the Carpathian Mountains. Andrew Tate's first Romanian address is a far cry from the glitzy lifestyle he paraded in Bucharest before his detention - it's a squat, three-storey building with yellow walls, a short drive from the village of Sacele.   The long drive there from Bucharest winds through mile after mile of snow-muffled forest, branches iced thickly to their tips, mountains sloping towards the horizon - it's like driving through a Christmas card.  Outside Sacele, the icy track narrows to the width of a car as it climbs towards the villa, a sheer drop on one side. No Ferraris here. A Dacia and a Skoda sit parked between slushy snowdrifts outside the building. Inside it's divided into small functional apartments. This is where, in apartments 9 and 17, the Tate brothers began building their Romanian business empire. Vasile Mezdrea, a local developer, sold them the properties ""in 2015, or early 2016"" for less than €35,000 ($37,900; £31,425) each. ""They paid in instalments because they didn't have the money to buy the flats outright,"" he told me. ""They had no car in those days - they used to take their girlfriends out shopping in taxis."" He says that Andrew moved here with a British girlfriend, Melissa, who bought a third apartment in the same block.  But, according to locals, she wasn't the only woman living here with the brothers. Several people told us that other women were either living in their apartments or visiting regularly. One, who didn't want to be named, said he had received complaints that naked women were clearly visible in the Tates' ground floor apartment. Inside the block, there are few people who remember the Tates. And those who do are keen not to speak on the record. ""They were contemptuous, arrogant,"" one said. But ""very discreet - there was no music, no fights"". She said their dog, a German Shepherd, was left loose to wander the building, at one point attacking one of the residents there, and leaving her with bruises.  Complaints to the brothers reportedly went unanswered.  Seven years on, the brothers are reportedly worth millions, with a Bucharest lifestyle of designer watches, private jets and an extensive property portfolio. In Sacele itself, with its post office, pizza restaurant and slot machines, the Tates are remembered most vividly for their recent return visits - their new flashy cars were unmissable. Vasile Mezdrea says they moved to Romania because it ""has beautiful women and it's cheaper to live"".  But he says the brothers had ambitions beyond Sacele. ""They always wanted more,"" he told me. Sacele might seem like an unlikely place for the two young British kickboxers to start out, but it reveals a connection with two people who would go on to play key roles in their lives. One is a businessman called Sebastian Vieru, who first brought the Tate brothers to Romania in 2014. Originally from the Brasov region around Sacele, Mr Vieru flew them out several times to act as coaches and commentators for his cage-fighting shows. It was Mr Vieru who told the Tates about Vasile Mezdrea's new apartment block outside Sarcele, advising them that the developer urgently needed funds to finish the building, and that they would get the apartments at a discount.  He says Andrew and Tristan Tate brought some money with them from the UK, but that their wealth grew quickly once in Romania. Tracing that wealth - how it was made and where it came from - is believed to form part of the investigation into rape and human trafficking allegations currently being carried out by Romania's organised crime unit. The properties in Sacele seem to have made them very little. They sold them a couple of years later, when they moved to Bucharest, for just a few thousand euros' profit. But they left this mountain hideaway with a new business: Talisman Enterprises makes its money from web portals, according to official Romanian records. It hasn't posted a profit since 2017. Sebastien Vieru says he acts as a financial executor for the company, which is registered to an address 15 kilometres from Sacele, owned until recently by Mr Vieru's parents. He also has a 10% stake in a real-estate company called War Room Vegas, also registered to the same address, and part-owned by Andrew Tate. The other is Andrew's girlfriend, Georgiana Naghel, a former employee in Mr Vieru's cage-fighting business. In August last year, according to official Romanian records, both Andrew and Tristan transferred all their shares in Talisman Enterprises, as well as its administration, to her. The transfer of the company to Ms Naghel, a Romanian national, came four months after police began investigating the brothers. There is no evidence the two actions are linked. Talisman Enterprises is also associated with another company that lists Ms Naghel as the sole shareholder, administrator and beneficiary; a management consultancy called New Era Learning, that was established in August 2022. There are no financial records listed for the company. A third company, a consulting firm called Groundbreaking Developments, was also transferred to Ms Naghel in August. In October, it was sold on to another company owned by Abigail Tyson, believed to be a close associate of the Tate brothers. Ms Naghel is now being held in preventative custody along with the Tate brothers and another Romanian national, Luana Radu. No charges have yet been brought against any of them. In the past few weeks, investigators have seized a wide range of assets belonging to the four suspects, including Talisman Enterprises. They have also raided a long list of properties belonging to the brothers, including a swathe of land in Brasov county, and houses in and around Bucharest. Designer watches have been seized, and the brothers' fleet of luxury cars removed from their warehouse-style compound on the outskirts of the capital. Observers believe that much of the Tates' wealth may come from their investments in a major chain of Romanian casinos, and their online training courses in Andrew Tate's rigid model of masculinity.   The investigation could well answer questions about how the pair moved from their cheap flat in the mountains to the world of Bugattis, cigars and private planes posted their on social media accounts.

Luxury rehab centres now offer therapy for 'crypto addiction',"There was a time when Don was pouring up to $200,000 (£164,700) every week into cryptocurrency trades.   He slept fitfully and would be up in the wee hours to monitor prices and his portfolio balance. ""I'd break into a sweat before going on long-haul flights, as I would not be able to access the internet,"" he said.  Don works in a company that processes central bank digital currency (CBDC) transactions. He did not want to use his real name and wishes to remain anonymous because he fears his comments could spark a backlash from investors. He says he went on a ""downward spiral"" in the middle of 2022 - and that's when he decided to seek help.  The solution came in the form of a four-week stay at The Balance, a sprawling rehabilitation centre with dozens of staff on the Spanish island of Majorca.  Don lived in a private villa and was attended to by his own butler and chef. His treatment comprised therapy but also massages, yoga and bike rides, all for a hefty bill: upwards of $75,000. Founded in Zurich, with properties in London and Majorca, The Balance describes itself as a ""safe space enabling health and fulfilment"". The landing page has pictures of a beachfront villa, spa and glowing testimonials from past clients. The centre lists treatment programmes for anxiety, burnout, depression, post-traumatic stress disorders and eating disorders.  Don says it helped him ""wean off crypto"".  The pandemic and a volatile crypto market have spurred a trading frenzy in digital currencies. And now, luxury rehab centres are cropping up around the world, promising to treat ""crypto addiction"".  Most of the rehab centres the BBC has found appear to be of the luxe variety, and also offer treatment for other addictions: narcotics, alcohol and eating disorders. Three rehab centres and two addiction clinics the BBC contacted said they have received hundreds of related queries in the past two years.  But addiction experts are sceptical whether crypto trading warrants such an exorbitant intervention.  ""The treatment for crypto addiction is similar to other addictions,"" says Anna Lembke, a psychiatry professor at Stanford University and chief of the Stanford Addiction Medicine Dual Diagnosis Clinic.  ""It's a biopsychosocial disease so it requires a biopsychosocial intervention: medications in some cases, individual and group psychotherapy, changing habits and environment, (or) implementing healthier replacement activities.""  But, she adds, the cost is not always justified. Experts like her argue that it's akin to gambling and should be treated as such.  ""They are making money off desperate people,"" says Lia Nower, director at the Centre for Gambling Studies in Rutgers School of Social Work. ""Whether you're 'addicted' to trading crypto, betting on sports, or playing the lottery, your symptoms and treatment will be largely the same.""  Like other addictions, treatment for crypto addiction should begin with abstinence and managing withdrawal symptoms - which could include anxiety, irritability and insomnia, Ms Lembke said. ""No crypto trading or viewing for at least four weeks, which gives the brain a chance to reset reward pathways. The [withdrawal] symptoms are usually time-limited and can be managed with emotional support and reassurance that they will eventually go away."" In the long run, treatment would also include healthier options for financial investment, she added.  Treating crypto addiction is a nascent business, so it doesn't yet require specific certifications. Most of the therapists and rehab centre executives the BBC spoke to describe themselves as certified counsellors for mental health and a variety of addictions, from alcohol to substance abuse, gaming and gambling. The centres argue that while crypto addiction has strong parallels with gambling, it's also more addictive - for one, it's more exciting because it's so unstable, and the trades can happen round the clock.   ""Crypto trading has an air of being legitimate, whilst gambling is more talked about as being potentially problematic,"" said Jan Gerber, chief executive at Zurich-based rehab centre Paracelsus Recovery.  Seeking help is also less common, he adds, because crypto trading is largely unregulated. In contrast, some countries require gambling platforms and casinos to proactively identify and exclude problem gamblers, or provide information and tools on how they should manage signs of addiction. The signs of a crypto addiction are not too different either.  Those who are addicted to crypto trading start to increasingly turn to it as a source of ""excitement and pleasure in their lives"", said Aaron Sternlicht, who runs New York-based Family Addiction Specialist with his wife, Lin. He says tell-tale signs include lying, stealing, debt; facing difficulties relaxing or sleeping; monitoring crypto prices at all hours; and trading at the expense of relationships, career and education opportunities.  Don, for example, sought options for treatment when his girlfriend broke up with him after she realised the extensive losses he had racked up during the crypto downturn in 2022.  Jane, a 32-year-old Londoner whose name has been changed on request, said she would go on ""trading benders"" that lasted three to four days, which convinced her partner that she was having an affair. ""The fact that I couldn't tell him what I was actually doing made it worse. Even though the truth is out now, our relationship never fully healed."" Jane started buying crypto in 2014. ""In the beginning, I was only investing a couple of thousands, but by the end, I could put hundreds of thousands down on just one trade,"" she says. She eventually sought help from Paracelsus Recovery, where programmes for crypto addiction range from four to six weeks, at a weekly cost of $104,000 (£85,000). Online therapy sessions cost $650 an hour. Treatment involves blood tests, customised diet plans, yoga, acupuncture, and medication where necessary, she added, describing it as a ""360-degree approach"" to mental health.  Crypto addicts often need help setting boundaries, such as time limits for trading and stop-loss limits, orders with instructions to close out a position when it reaches a certain price, to guard investors against excessive losses.  Therapists at the centre help them to set such boundaries, said Abdullah Boulad, chief executive officer and founder of The Balance. But he added that they do not mandate that clients go cold turkey, or require them to completely disconnect from their devices. Crypto addiction, experts say, is also often diagnosed because of other conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Keith, who also did not wish to use his real name, said he went to Paracelsus Recovery because of dependency on sleep medication, but later found crypto addiction to be the root cause.  The 51-year-old says he got hooked on crypto trading during the Covid-19 lockdown.  ""We were all isolated. This made it easy to trade in secret,"" he says.  ""It was only when my children came to stay with me over Christmas that I realised how erratic I had become. I was hostile towards them, and they were worried that I was sleeping for days at a time. Yet, all the while, none of us thought my trading was part of the problem.""  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64245669
Elon Musk found not guilty of fraud over Tesla tweet,"Tesla's Elon Musk has been cleared of wrongdoing for a tweet in which he said he had ""funding secured"" to take the electric carmaker back into private ownership. Shareholders argued he misled them with his posts in August 2018, and they had lost billions of dollars because of them. The proposed $72bn (£60bn) buyout never materialised. If found liable, Musk could have been ordered to pay out billions in damages. It took the nine jurors less than two hours to reach their verdict on the class-action lawsuit on Friday afternoon.  Mr Musk - who had wanted the trial moved to Texas, where Tesla is based, arguing he could not get a fair trial in San Francisco - welcomed the outcome. Taking to Twitter, the social media platform he bought for $44bn last October, he posted: ""Thank goodness, the wisdom of the people has prevailed! ""I am deeply appreciative of the jury's unanimous finding of innocence in the Tesla 420 take-private case."" Central to the lawsuit was Mr Musk's tweet on 7 August 2018: ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured."" The plaintiffs also argued Mr Musk had lied when he tweeted later in the day that ""investor support is confirmed"". The stock price surged after the tweets, but fell back again within days as it became clear the deal would not go through. According to an economist hired by the shareholders, investor losses were calculated as high as $12bn, after many made decisions about buying and selling their shares based on the tweet.   The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Mr Musk over his tweets, accusing him of lying to investors. Mr Musk agreed to step aside as Tesla board chairman and settled for $20m. During the three-week trial, Mr Musk - who also leads SpaceX and Twitter - had argued he thought he had a verbal commitment from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund for the deal. During his nearly nine hours on the witness stand, the world's second-richest man said: ""Just because I tweet something does not mean people believe it or will act accordingly."" Shareholders had argued that ""funding secured"" suggested more than a verbal agreement.  Although Tesla's share price shot up after the tweet was posted, Mr Musk also questioned whether his tweets had any effect on Tesla's share price.  ""At one point I tweeted that I thought that, in my opinion, the stock price was too high... and it went higher, which is counterintuitive,"" he said - arguing the effect his tweets have on the stock price can be unpredictable.  Mr Musk said he eventually scrapped the plan to take Tesla private after his discussions with smaller investors led him to believe they would prefer that the firm remain publicly traded. He was not in court when the verdict was read, but he was present during closing arguments earlier on Friday as duelling portraits were drawn of him by the rival legal teams. Nicholas Porritt, a lawyer for the Tesla shareholders, said: ""Our society is based on rules. We need rules to save us from anarchy. Rules should apply to Elon Musk like everyone else."" Mr Musk's attorney, Alex Spiro, said: ""Just because it's a bad tweet doesn't make it a fraud."" After the verdict, Mr Porritt said: ""We are disappointed with the verdict and are considering next steps."" Mr Musk was generally calm during his testimony - though at times he appeared annoyed at the line of questioning.  There were also times of levity. After a lawyer representing shareholders accidentally called Elon Musk ""Mr Tweet"", Elon Musk promptly changed his name on Twitter to the same moniker.  Several Tesla directors also testified, including James Murdoch, son of Rupert Murdoch. They testified that Mr Musk did not need the Tesla board to review buyout tweets.  Securities fraud lawyer Reed Kathrein called the tweet about taking Tesla private ""as concrete a statement of taking a company private as there can be"", and said the not guilty verdict was ""a travesty to investors and the securities laws"".

Cold water swims helped Bristol woman beat eating disorder,"A woman who said she overcome an eating disorder thanks in part to cold water swimming is now aiming for a place at the Ironman World Championships.  Megan Hamill, 23, spent seven years restricting her food but found cold water swimming ""shifted her mindset"". The University of Bristol student wants to get on the podium at Ironman Austria, to eventually get a spot at the world championships.  Miss Hamill said cold water swimming stopped her ""negative thoughts"".  Growing up in Portadown in Northern Ireland, Miss Hamill said her life changed when, aged 11, her father had an accident which left him with lifelong injuries and her mum was later diagnosed with cancer. She said: ""At that age you're really influenced by what's happening around you but you don't really have control over your thoughts. ""My way of dealing with the trauma was by shrinking myself and putting that negative focus on my body.  ""I had a victim mindset and didn't share what was happening with anyone."" The 23-year-old said she often focused on her appearance and struggled to relax, even with friends.  ""I was basically starving myself, because of the energy imbalance I would get brain fog and I didn't have a healthy menstrual cycle until I was 20.  ""It was lonely at times."" But in 2017, she began to recover after cold water swimming, discovering self-help books and doing Wim Hof breathing. Some reports suggest cold water swimming can relieve depression, others claim it can help overcome grief. There is even early research investigating whether it can help slow down dementia as well as a documented case of cold water swimming helping with chronic pain. ""I didn't have a healthy relationship with myself before,"" Ms Hamill said. ""I'm definitely a completely different person now, full of ideas and innovation."" ""Food is just fuel now,"" she added. ""I used to feel like the photos before nights out were a prettiness competition but now I think the least interesting thing about you is how you look. ""When I fuelled myself correctly I was able to think clearly, communicate better, articulate ideas better and perform optimally.  ""I felt stronger and didn't want to sacrifice all of this to fit a certain size of clothing."" Now in her final year, she is determined to get a podium place at Ironman Austria on 18 June, which will require her to swim 2.4 miles, cycle 112 miles and run 26.2miles. Miss Hamill is now training six days a week, sometimes twice a day, while studying geography with innovation at Bristol University.  Alongside studying, she now helps others develop healthy habits through her social channels, organises cold water swims, hosts a podcast and is about to launch her own wellbeing product. During the Covid-19 lockdowns Miss Hamill started a wellbeing podcast and now has 30,000 followers on Instagram and TikTok, where she teaches people how to ""detach their self-worth from their dress size"".  ""I was so lucky to find friends at university who really influenced me in a positive way. We've been on a self-development journey together,"" she said. After university Miss Hamill plans to become a female coach holding wellbeing retreats and workshops.

Interpol working out how to police the metaverse,"Interpol secretary general Jurgen Stock says the global police agency is investigating how the organisation could police crime in the metaverse. The metaverse is the widely-discussed, but not yet realised, concept that in the future people will be represented by 3D avatars in their online lives. Interpol has built its own virtual reality (VR) space, where users can do training and attend virtual meetings. Mr Stock said it is important for the agency to not get left behind. ""Criminals are sophisticated and professional in very quickly adapting to any new technological tool that is available to commit crime,"" he said.  ""We need to sufficiently respond to that. Sometimes lawmakers, police, and our societies are running a little bit behind. ""We have seen if we are doing it too late, it already impacts trust in the tools we are using, and therefore the metaverse. In similar platforms that already exist, criminals are using it."" The environment, which can only be accessed through secure servers, enables police officers to experience what the metaverse could be, giving them a sense of the crimes that could occur, and how they could be policed. Some people think the metaverse could be the future of the internet.  The belief is that it could be to VR what the modern smartphone is to the first clunky mobile phones of the 1980s. Instead of being on a computer, in the metaverse you might use a headset to enter a virtual world connecting all sorts of digital environments. But because it's still just an idea, there's no single agreed definition of the metaverse.  In as many words, calling a VR world the metaverse is a bit like calling Google the internet.  So how can Interpol, an organisation that facilitates global police co-operation, investigate the metaverse if it does not yet exist? This is where virtual worlds would come into play. But within these virtual worlds there have been real-life problems. In 2022, a BBC investigation identified issues surrounding verbal and sexual harassment within VR games, which a journalist called ""disturbing"". And later that year, campaigners said the avatar of a 21-year-old researcher was sexually assaulted in Meta's VR platform Horizon Worlds. Dr Madan Oberoi, Interpol's executive director of technology and innovation, said there are issues with defining a metaverse crime. ""There are crimes where I don't know whether it can still be called a crime or not,"" he said.  ""For example, there have been reported cases of sexual harassment.   ""If you look at the definitions of these crimes in physical space, and you try to apply it in the metaverse, there is a difficulty.  ""We don't know whether we can call them a crime or not, but those threats are definitely there, so those issues are yet to be resolved."" He said one of the big challenges facing Interpol was raising awareness of these problems. ""My typically used example is that if you have to save a drowning person, you need to know swimming,"" he said.  ""Similarly, if law enforcement is interested to help people who have been hurt in the metaverse, they need to know about the metaverse.  ""And that is one of our objectives - to make sure law enforcement personnel start using the metaverse and they become aware.  ""In that sense, it is very important."" In terms of regulation, Nina Jane Patel, co-founder and head of metaverse research organisation Kabuni, said: ""That which is illegal and harmful in the physical world should be illegal in the virtual synthetic world as well.  ""In this realm of convergence, we will be in a very difficult position if we can treat each other in a certain way in the virtual world, but not in the physical world.  ""And we'll be causing a lot of disconnection and miscommunication between what's acceptable human behaviour in our digital world and our physical world."" And Mr Stock said Interpol will be critical in investigating future metaverse crimes. ""With a click of a mouse, evidence is on another continent,"" he said. ""Cyber-crime is international by nature.  ""This is why Interpol is so important, because only national cyber-crime does not exist - almost all of the cases have an international dimension.  ""That makes the role of Interpol, almost 100 years after its creation, so critical in today's world, because no country can fight these types of crime in isolation. ""That is what Interpol is about with 195 member countries, they all are needed to tackle that type of crime.""    Watch the full report on Click ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64501726
"Andrew Tate: Influencer threatened workers with violence, victim claims","An alleged victim in the case against online influencer Andrew Tate appears to have told prosecutors that she was forced to earn a minimum of €10,000 (£9,000) a month on social media platforms, under the threat of physical violence. The testimony, which appears in a leaked court document seen by the BBC, says ""the alleged victim continued working to a strict schedule… staying live on TikTok for 12 hours with only a five-minute break"", with the defendants ""forcing her to earn a minimum of €10,000 a month and threatening to beat her if she didn't perform her job"". The document also outlines the witness's fear that the group would publish intimate videos and photos of her if she tried to quit, as she says they did in the case of another woman. Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan are being held in preventive custody in Romania while police investigate allegations of human trafficking and rape, which both men deny.   Two Romanian women and close associates of theirs, Georgiana Naghel and Luana Radu, are also being held alongside them. The leaked document from the Romanian court, which contains more detailed allegations than publicly available court statements, also describes debts being used as ""a form of psychological coercion"" by the group.   ""So-called 'fines' were imposed by the defendants if the girls did not post on OnlyFans,"" the document claims, with one witness owing ""at that time, the sum of €4,000."" In a separate piece of testimony, another witness describes working on the TikTok and OnlyFans platforms for several months in 2021 without a contract, on a schedule set by one of the defendants, saying that she was allowed to keep 50% of her earnings, with the remaining 50% divided between the Tate brothers and their alleged manager. She also alleges she was not allowed to leave the location unless accompanied. Some of the alleged victims ""den[y] any form of exploitation by the four defendants"", the court says, but ""these statements do not reflect reality, as... the victims of human trafficking do not always recognise the fact that they have been enslaved and exploited"". 29 December 2022 - Tate brothers arrested at their Bucharest home 30 December 2022 - Court rules Tate brothers will stay in detention for 30 days 10 January 2023 - Tate brothers unsuccessfully appeal against their detention 15 January 2023 - Police seize Tate's luxury cars 20 January 2023 - Judge extends Tate brothers' detention until 27 February 1 February 2023 - Appeal against extension is rejected by judges Prosecutors believe that Andrew Tate used ""the lover-boy method"" of recruiting women, appearing to offer them the chance of a serious and committed relationship, before coercing them to produce pornographic material for online sites.

"Turkey earthquake: Death toll could increase eight-fold, WHO says","The death toll from a strong earthquake in south-eastern Turkey, near Syria's border, could rise eight-fold, the World Health Organisation has warned. The toll, which currently stands at more than 3,400 people, has increased rapidly since the first earthquake struck early on Monday morning. About 12 hours later, a second powerful tremor hit further north. Rescuers have been combing through mountains of rubble in freezing and snowy conditions to find survivors. Countries around the world are sending support to help the rescue efforts, including specialist teams, sniffer dogs and equipment. The US Geological Survey said the 7.8 magnitude tremor struck at 04:17 local time (01:17 GMT) at a depth of 17.9km (11 miles) near the city of Gaziantep.  Seismologists said the first quake was one of the largest ever recorded in Turkey. Survivors said it took two minutes for the shaking to stop. The second quake - triggered by the first - had a magnitude of 7.5, and its epicentre was in the Elbistan district of Kahramanmaras province.  Many aftershocks are still being felt across the region. The number of dead and injured from both Turkey and Syria has increased rapidly throughout Monday.  The WHO has warned that those numbers are likely to increase as much as eight times, as rescuers find more victims in the rubble. ""We always see the same thing with earthquakes, unfortunately, which is that the initial reports of the numbers of people who have died or who have been injured will increase quite significantly in the week that follows,"" the WHO's senior emergency officer for Europe, Catherine Smallwood, told AFP. Ms Smallwood added that the snowy conditions will leave many people without shelter, adding to the dangers. Many of the victims are in war-torn northern Syria, where millions of refugees live in camps on both sides of the border with Turkey. There have been dozens of fatalities reported in rebel-held areas. Thousands of buildings across both the countries have collapsed, and several videos show the moment they fell, as onlookers ran for cover. Many buildings that were as large as 12 storeys high are now flattened, roads have been destroyed and there are huge mountains of rubble as far as the eye can see. Among the buildings destroyed was Gaziantep Castle, an historic landmark that has stood for more than 2,000 years. The BBC's Middle East correspondent Anna Foster, reporting from the Turkish city of Osmaniye, near the epicentre, described a devastating scene. ""It's absolutely pouring with rain which is hampering the rescue efforts. There is no power at all in the city tonight.  ""We're still feeling regular after-shocks... and there are still concerns that there may be still more buildings to collapse,"" our correspondent said. Turkey's energy infrastructure has also been damaged, and videos have emerged showing large fires in southern Turkey. Social media users claimed they were caused by damage to gas pipelines.  Turkey's energy minister Fatih Donmez confirmed there had been serious damage to the infrastructure, but did not mention the explosions. Turkey lies in one of the world's most active earthquake zones.  In 1999 a deadly quake killed more than 17,000 in the north-west. The country's worst earthquake disaster was in 1939 when 33,000 people died in Turkey's eastern Erzincan province. One Kahramanmaras resident, Melisa Salman, said living in an earthquake zone meant she was used to ""being shaken"", but Monday's tremor was ""the first time we have ever experienced anything like that"". ""We thought it was the apocalypse,"" she said. The Turkish Red Crescent has called for citizens to make blood donations, and the organisation's president, Kerem Kınık, said on Twitter that additional blood and medical products were being sent to the affected region. Following an international appeal for help, Turkey's President Erdogan said 45 countries had offered support. UN Secretary General António Guterres has called for an international response to the crisis, saying that many of the families hit by the disaster were ""already in dire need of humanitarian aid in areas where access is a challenge"".  The European Union is sending search and rescue teams to Turkey, while rescuers from the Netherlands and Romania are already on their way. The UK has said it will send 76 specialists, equipment and rescue dogs. France, Germany, Israel, and the US have also pledged to help. Russian President Vladimir Putin has offered help to both Turkey and Syria, as has Iran. Turkey's interior minister, Suleymon Soylu, said 10 cities were affected by the initial quake including Hatay, Osmaniye, Adiyaman, Malatya, Sanliurfa, Adana, Diyarbakir and Kilis.  School has been suspended in those cities for at least a week. A volunteer with the White Helmets rescue group, which operates in rebel-controlled areas of north-western Syria, fought back tears as he described the devastation in Sarmada, near the border with Turkey. ""Many buildings in different cities and villages in north-western Syria collapsed,"" he told the BBC. ""Still now, many families are under the rubble. We are trying to save them but it's a very hard task for us. ""We need help. We need the international community to do something, to help us, to support us. North-western Syria is now a disaster area,"" he added. The earthquake was powerful enough to be felt as far away as Cyprus, Lebanon and Israel. Are you in the affected region?

Turkey earthquake: Roman-era castle destroyed by quake,"The devastation wrought by Monday's deadly earthquake in south-eastern Turkey included the almost total destruction of a 2,000-year-old castle built during the Roman Empire.  Footage obtained by the BBC showed severe damage at the hilltop Gaziantep Castle, in the centre of the city.  It was built in the 2nd and 3rd Centuries, before becoming a museum. Two plus-7 magnitude quakes hit the region on Monday, killing more than 2,000 people in Turkey and Syria. A video obtained and verified by the BBC showed Gaziantep Castle in ruins, with many of its walls collapsed and broken into pieces on the streets below.  Some of the fortifications in the ""east, south and south-east"" of the castle had been destroyed by the earthquake, Turkish state-run news agency Anadolu has been reported as saying, adding that ""debris was scattered on the road"".  Parts of the nearby Sirvani Mosque were also destroyed, reports said.  The castle was built by the Romans during the 2nd and 3rd centuries, then strengthened and expanded by the Byzantine emperor Justinian I in the 6th Century.  It also saw changes made during the reign of the Ayyubids in the 12th and 13th Centuries, as well as the Ottoman Empire, and played an important role during Turkey's war of independence of the early 20th Century.  Until recently it served as the Gaziantep Defence and Heroism Panoramic Museum.  Hours after the first earthquake, a second quake, with a magnitude of 7.5, hit the Elbistan district of Kahramanmaras province. Seismologists have said the first earthquake was one of the largest ever recorded in Turkey.  Hundreds of buildings have collapsed in both Turkey and Syria, with rescuers working to save people trapped beneath the rubble.  Shocking images show buildings that were four or five storeys high flattened, roads destroyed and mountains of rubble.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64541894

Turkey earthquake: Where did it hit and why was it so deadly?,"More than 2,000 people have been killed and thousands injured by a huge earthquake which struck south-eastern Turkey, near the Syrian border, in the early hours of Monday morning. The earthquake, which hit near the town of Gaziantep, was closely followed by numerous aftershocks - including one quake which was almost as large as the first. It was a big earthquake - registered as 7.8, classified as ""major"" on the official magnitude scale. It broke along about 100km (62 miles) of fault line, causing serious damage to buildings near the fault.  Prof Joanna Faure Walker, head of the Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction at University College London, said: ""Of the deadliest earthquakes in any given year, only two in the last 10 years have been of equivalent magnitude, and four in the previous 10 years."" But it is not only the power of the tremor that causes devastation.  This incident occurred in the early hours of the morning, when people were inside and sleeping.  The sturdiness of the buildings is also a factor. Dr Carmen Solana, reader in volcanology and risk communication at the University of Portsmouth, says: ""The resistant infrastructure is unfortunately patchy in South Turkey and especially Syria, so saving lives now mostly relies on response. The next 24 hours are crucial to find survivors. After 48 hours the number of survivors decreases enormously."" This was a region where there had not been a major earthquake for more than 200 years or any warning signs, so the level of preparedness would be less than for a region which was more used to dealing with tremors. The Earth's crust is made up of separate bits, called plates, that nestle alongside each other.  These plates often try to move but are prevented by the friction of rubbing up against an adjoining one. But sometimes the pressure builds until one plate suddenly jerks across, causing the surface to move. In this case it was the Arabian plate moving northwards and grinding against the Anatolian plate. Friction from the plates has been responsible for very damaging earthquakes in the past.  On 13 August 1822 it caused an earthquake registering 7.4 in magnitude, significantly less than the 7.8 magnitude recorded on Monday. Even so, the 19th Century earthquake resulted in immense damage to towns in the area, with 7,000 deaths recorded in the city of Aleppo alone. Damaging aftershocks continued for nearly a year. There have already been several aftershocks following the current earthquake and scientists are expecting it to follow the same trend as the previous big one in the region. They are measured on a scale called the Moment Magnitude Scale (Mw). This has replaced the better known Richter scale, now considered outdated and less accurate. The number attributed to an earthquake represents a combination of the distance the fault line has moved and the force that moved it . A tremor of 2.5 or less usually cannot be felt, but can be detected by instruments. Quakes of up to five are felt and cause minor damage. The Turkish earthquake at 7.8 is classified as major and usually causes serious damage, as it has in this instance.  Anything above 8 causes catastrophic damage and can totally destroy communities at its centre. The earthquake off the coast of Japan in 2011 was registered as magnitude 9 and caused widespread damage on the land, and caused a tsunami - which led to a major accident at nuclear plant along the coast. The largest ever earthquake was 9.5 recorded in Chile in 1960. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-64540696
"Turkey earthquake: Screaming, shaking... how it felt when the quake hit","It was 04:17 local time when Erdem, asleep at his home in Gaziantep, southern Turkey, was shaken from his sleep by one of Turkey's biggest-ever earthquakes. ""I have never felt anything like it in the 40 years I've lived,"" he said. ""We were shaken at least three times very strongly, like a baby in a crib."" People went to their cars to escape the damaged buildings. ""I imagine not a single person in Gaziantep is in their homes now,"" Erdem said. In the city's hospital, Gökce Bay was supposed to be recovering from a kidney transplant on Sunday.  Instead, she was pulling a drip from her arm and helping fellow patients out of the building.  She said: ""I had a kidney operation only yesterday and now I am out in my flip-flops in the rain and my feet are soaking wet. Not only me, some very old patients are out without any jackets or shoes."" More than 130 miles (209km) west, in Adana, Nilüfer Aslan was convinced her and her family would die when the quake shook their fifth-floor apartment. ""I have never seen anything like this in my life. We swayed for close to one minute,"" she said. ""[I said to my family] 'There is an earthquake, at least let's die together in the same place'... It was the only thing that crossed my mind."" When the quake paused, Aslan fled outside - ""I couldn't take anything with me, I'm standing outside in slippers"" - to find that four buildings surrounding her own had collapsed. In Diyarbakir, 300 miles (482km) east, people rushed into the streets to help rescuers. ""There was screaming everywhere,"" one 30-year-old man told the Reuters news agency. ""I started pulling rocks away with my hands. We pulled out the injured with friends, but the screaming didn't stop. Then the [rescue] teams came."" Elsewhere in the city, Muhittin Orakci said seven members of their family were buried in the rubble. ""My sister and her three children are there,"" he told the AFP news agency. ""And also her husband, her father-in-law and her mother-in-law."" In Syria, a large number of buildings collapsed in Aleppo, around a two-hour drive from the epicentre. Health director Ziad Hage Taha said wounded people were ""arriving in waves"" following the disaster.  Özgül Konakçı, a 25-year-old who lives in Malatya, Turkey, said the aftershocks - and freezing weather - made things worse. ""It's very cold and it's snowing right now,"" she told BBC Turkish. ""Everyone is on the streets, people are confused about what to do. Just before our eyes, the windows of a building exploded due to aftershocks."" As a second earthquake occurred at 10:24 GMT, a camera operator for Turkish news channel A Haber could be seen running from a collapsing building in Malatya as screaming was heard in the background.  ""As we were heading to the rubble to [film] search and rescue efforts, there were two consecutive aftershocks with a loud noise,"" reporter Yuksel Akalan said on air. ""The building you are seeing on my left was brought down to earth. There is a lot of dust. A local resident is coming and he is covered in dust. A mother is taking her children [away]."" Ozgul Konacki, 25 and from Malatya, spoke while waiting outside with her family, having seen buildings around them collapse. ""Some people wanted to go back to their houses because it was too cold,"" she said. ""But then we felt strong aftershocks and they were out again."" Ismail Al Abdullah - a rescuer from Syrian humanitarian group White Helmets - has been working in Sarmada, near the border with Turkey, rescuing survivors. ""Many buildings in different cities and villages in north-western Syria collapsed, destroyed by this earthquake,"" he said. ""We need help.

Cows arrive as new Wandlebury Country Park lawnmowers,"A country park has taken delivery of new ""lawnmowers"" in the form of eight Belted Galloway cows. They have travelled from Scotland to maintain the wild flower meadows at Wandlebury Country Park near Cambridge. Ed Wombwell, estate manager for Cambridge Past Present and Future, which runs the park, said the cows' small size made them perfect for roaming the park's meadows. He also stressed they were ""not picky"" about what they ate. ""They're small cows so they're perfect for our conservation,"" Mr Wombwell said. ""Here on the meadow we've got chalk grassland which is a fantastic biodiversity-rich habitat - both nationally and internationally important - and the best way of managing that is by the use of grazing animals. ""The small size means they can get around easily and they're not picky, so they can eat all the rough stuff that other cows won't eat."" He said the way the cattle eat, grabbing grass with their tongues and selecting dominant species, helped ""create the perfect habitat for hundreds of different wildflowers"". The park also uses Highland cattle to manage its land, but there are now only three at the park. ""Unfortunately they weren't able to keep up - as they get older they get more efficient - they know what they want and they don't want to be moved around too much, so we called in reinforcements and got their country cousins in,"" said Mr Wombwell. He added the new arrivals were ""doing a fantastic job, coming in and hoovering up this lovely grassland"".  After about two weeks in their new home he said the cattle were settling in well.

Greater horseshoe bat: Derelict building restored for rare breeding colony,"A building is being restored in West Sussex for what is thought to be the first breeding colony of a species of rare bat in the county.    Britain's population of greater horseshoe bats was, until recently, restricted to south and west Wales and south-west England.  The Vincent Wildlife Trust (VWT) bought the derelict farm buildings last year where five pups were born last summer.  The former Victorian stable block is now being repaired for the bats.  Tom Kitching, bat conservation officer for the VWT, said the site was the home of the first population of the greater horseshoe bat in Sussex, and was the only breeding roost.  The animals spend the winter hibernating in nearby disused railway tunnels and cellars, he said.  They will then return to the breeding roost in the South Downs National Park in April and give birth in June and July.  ""Mothers will be flying out every evening to feed. It will be noisy during the day with all the pups squeaking around.  ""In summer it's really bustling with activity."" Source: Vincent Wildlife Trust The former stable block in Sussex was in danger of falling down, before the VWT bought the site, as part of its programme of restoring buildings as habitats for the bats.  ""These bats almost exclusively use man-made buildings in the UK to breed in,"" Mr Kitching said.  Mr Kitching said: ""Unless there's someone restoring them and looking after them and protecting them, then they've got nowhere to breed. ""It's because of this work that these populations elsewhere in the UK are increasing."" The range of the bats used to extend as far east as Kent, but the population declined to between 2,000 and 3,000 animals in the mid-20th Century.  There are now about 13,000 of the flying mammals in the UK, the VMT says.  Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram. Send your story ideas to southeasttoday@bbc.co.uk.

"New wetland in Wilton to be planted with 20,000 native plants","Volunteers are preparing to plant 20,000 native species on newly created wetland. The Wilton Wetlands project is helping to cut flood risk to nearby Wiltshire communities and boost biodiversity.  Rewetting just five acres of former farmland is already having a big impact, according to conservationists. It is cutting the amount of sediment and agricultural pollution washing into the River Kennet and is expected to become a haven for wildlife.  Rupert Kelton, from Action for the River Kennet, said: ""A lot of (the UK's) wetlands were lost a long time ago with land drainage, particularly for industry and for development. ""So reversing that trend and creating new wetlands is incredibly important."" He continued: ""The wetland here in Wilton is helping reduce flood risk down in the village of Wilton and further down in the river catchment. ""It helps to reduce pollution from sediment and nutrients from water that is draining through the ditch network."" Mr Kelton said come summer visitors can expect to see flowers such as flag irises and purple loosestrife, as well as rushes and sedges. The land for the project belongs to farmer David Lemon, one of the founding members of conservation organisation Southern Streams.  It is made up of a consortium of farmers managing about 25,000 acres in total. They are working to manage the landscape to improve the health of rivers and streams, biodiversity and soil quality.   Mr Lemon said the site had previously been a grass meadow.  ""We didn't do an awful lot with it so it's quite nice to be able to do something that's really meaningful and is going to make a difference to the landscape,"" he said.  The surrounding area is already seeing the benefits of the wetlands, particularly following the heavy rain seen after December's cold snap.   The wetland slowed the passage of the water through the landscape giving it time to drain, meaning not a single property flooded.  Mr Lemon said a huge variety of wildlife would be attracted to the site, adding: ""It will be a really fantastic spot for people to come and enjoy.""

Lynemouth industrial beach rubbish clean-up to start this year,"Clean-up work costing £5m to rid a beach of ""historical pollution"" - including mining pipes, cables and machinery - will start later this year. The items have been exposed as waves wash away parts of cliffs at Lynemouth at an ex-colliery landfill site. Northumberland County Council has allocated the money to stop waste deposits from washing into the sea.    In 2020 the authority said tests on beach samples had revealed some waste could be harmful to humans. Planning and regulatory consents have also been received to allow the project to go ahead. It had been hoped the clean-up work would be carried out sooner but the authority said weather and environmental constraints had affected the start date. The council said preparatory work would start on the beach in autumn, with the main work starting next year. It will see contaminated areas of the beach excavated and removed before the dunes are reformed with a mix of earth and sand.  Northumberland Council cabinet member John Riddle said: ""While we would like to have started earlier, many factors were outside our control.  ""The new timeline also enables us to finalise details and funding arrangements with the Coal Authority over the works needed on their land to the north of the Lyneburn so we can do this as a single 'integrated' scheme, securing best value and delivering the best outcomes for the local environment and the communities in this part of Northumberland.""  Before the work starts, council teams will continue to remove material from the beach found in weekly inspections. Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Australia shark attack victim identified as schoolgirl Stella Berry,"A 16-year-old killed by a shark while swimming in a Western Australia (WA) river has been identified as Stella Berry. The schoolgirl was pronounced dead after being pulled from the Swan River in Perth on Saturday. Stella was riding jet skis with friends when she jumped into the water to swim with dolphins and was attacked, police say. In a statement, her parents said they were ""devastated and deeply shocked"". Matt and Sophie Berry said their daughter was a ""vibrant and happy girl"" who loved the water and art. ""She was a caring person and was a dear friend to many... a beautiful and loving big sister and the best daughter we could have hoped for."" One of her friends, Lara Connolly, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Stella was the ""sweetest and smartest girl that I knew"". ""She was so kind,"" Lara said. Authorities are investigating what type of shark was involved, but the WA Fisheries Minister has said it was ""likely"" a bull shark. The government will consider what could be done to prevent any similar incidents, Don Punch said. ""Shark barriers is something we're always open to talking to local government about."" Fisheries experts say it is unusual to find sharks in that part of the Swan River, and the attack is the first fatal one along the river in 100 years. Historically, dying from a shark bite is not common. In more than a century of records, Australia's shark attack mortality rate is 0.9 - less than one person per year. There were two fatal shark attacks in 2021, and seven in 2020. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-64533760
The Antarctic and Arctic sounds rarely heard before,"What do you hear when you think of the Arctic and Antarctic?  ""Singing"" ice, a seal that sounds like it is in space, and a seismic airgun thundering like a bomb are some of the noises released by two marine acoustic labs. The project introduces the public to 50 rarely heard sounds recorded underwater in the polar regions. It highlights how noisy oceans are becoming due to increased human activity that also disrupts sea life. ""These sounds are fairly alien to most people,"" explains artist and researcher Dr Geraint Rhys Whittaker. ""We probably think we know what the poles sound like but often that is imagined,"" adds Dr Whittaker, who works at the Helmholtz Institute for Functional Marine Biodiversity and the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany. The underwater microphones were attached to floats with scientific instruments left in the Arctic and Antarctic for about two years.  One sound captured was calls from the least-researched Antarctic seal. Ross seals live in the open seas and on pack ice that is difficult to reach. The scientists recorded five calls from the creature of different frequencies. Crabeater seals, minke whales, narwhals and humpback whales were also recorded. It can be hard to capture these sounds due to the inhospitable environment and the vast distances that animals travel in the regions. ""The difficulty is knowing where the mammals will be because they move and you can't rely on where they will be,"" explains Dr Whittaker. The roaring collapse of ice shelves was also recorded, a process that is being accelerated in parts of the polar regions by rising temperatures linked to climate change. The delicate sound of ice ""singing"" is included in the collection. It is caused by ice moving in water, or contracting as temperatures rise and fall, or when ice melts and refreezes. Few people read scientific research published by universities, Dr Whittaker suggests, and he hopes that listening to the sounds will make people stop and think about the polar oceans. Oceans occupy 71% of our planet's surface and are hugely important for preserving life on Earth but are severely impacted by climate change.  Temperatures in the Arctic are rising four times faster than other parts of the world. The microphones also picked up human-made noise in the oceans, caused by shipping and oil and gas exploration.  Noise pollution from seismic blasting, used to explore the seabed, travels huge distances and scientists have found it negatively affects animal life. The project reveals just how noisy the oceans are, suggests Dr Whittaker, who says he hopes it highlights the need for laws to reduce noise from shipping and dredging damaging marine life. Working with the sound-art project Cities and Memory, the noises have also been turned into more than 100 compositions put together by musicians highlighting climate change.  ""With Earth's poles warming faster than the global average, this collection of sounds aims to draw attention to a fascinating but rapidly changing environment, and encourages us to think about ways to preserve it for future generations,"" explains Stuart Fowkes, founder of Cities and Memory. Dr Ilse van Opzeeland, from the Ocean Acoustics Group at Alfred Wegener Institute, hopes combining art and science will help raise awareness. ""A 'translation' through art breathes new life into our scientific data that goes beyond a traditional publication or policy paper by making it accessible to non-scientists,"" she said. ""We must make the greatest efforts to protect, conserve and restore our planet's endangered habitats. The interaction of art and science can help by creating awareness and brings attention to this."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-64514258
Beyoncé: Renaissance hat designer flooded with orders,"An Etsy seller who designed the hat Beyoncé wore to advertise her new tour says she has been flooded with orders. Abby Misbin, 24, has been selling the glitter ball-inspired cowboy hats on the online marketplace since graduating in 2021. What originally started as a ""side-hustle"" went stratospheric after Queen Bey wore the sparkly accessory on her Renaissance tour poster. Abby, from Philadelphia, in the USA, says she was contacted in early June. One of the singer's stylists sent her a message that said: ""Hi, Abby, need to have for Beyoncé needed by June 9. Where are you located?"" ""Honestly, it read like a scam message,"" she says. ""I shouldn't have believed it as quickly as I did."" So Abby replied, the stylist made a few requests for the design, and she got to work. ""I was so worried that the shipping would be delayed or something would happen that I just stayed up all night to finish it,"" Abby says.  Abby painstakingly creates each of her designs by hand, using tiny squares of mirrored glass - one usually takes about five to six hours to complete, she says. She says she charged Beyoncé's team $215 for the item, with an extra $60 or so on top for express shipping. And that was the last she heard, until the hat she'd created made a low-key appearance. ""It was just like kind of sneaked into a music video and I figured that was it,"" says Abby. ""And even that that was good enough for me."" Abby took screenshots and posted them on her Instagram story - but her friends weren't convinced. ""Guys, look at the hat I made for Beyoncé,"" Abby says.  ""They all thought it was a big joke."" That was until Beyoncé's own Instagram post announcing her Renaissance tour. ""Oh my God, it was literally so insane. I thought she was done with it. I had no clue that she included it in the photo shoot. Just knowing it was in her presence is really cool."" And her friends? ""Obviously now they all believe me,"" says Abby. Abby's group chats have been blowing up with loved ones sending her screenshots of articles about her hats. And her order list has also exploded. She's roped in her mum and dad to help, but says she's going to keep her output to about two pieces a day. But there's one thing that's in even bigger demand right now - tickets to the tour Abby's hat helped to promote.  So far, Abby's not got her hands on one.  ""I'm a big Beyoncé fan, obviously. ""But the tickets are so hard to get. And if worse comes to worse, I'll stand outside the stadiums with my friends, selling hats.""

"Wet Leg deserve Grammy wins, says Isle of Wight music teacher","A former music teacher of Grammy-winning band Wet Leg has said the indie stars deserve their success.  The Isle of Wight-based musicians won two Grammys at the awards in Los Angeles on Sunday, less than two years after their first live gig.  Peter Pontin, co-director of Platform One music college in Newport, said Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers met during their BTech in 2010.  ""It's great to see them get the recognition,"" he added. Aged 16, the pair joined the island's only independent music college to study for a two-year course which focussed on performance, composition, song-writing, sound recording and music theory. Recalling the early days of their musical career, Mr Pontin said: ""Hester was on guitar - she was very creative, very artistic, into her fashion and jewellery making.  ""Rhian was quite quirky, a bit Bjork-like - there was something very different about her."" The course helped build the women's confidence so they came out as ""creative all-rounders"", Mr Pontin said.  It was during this time they met two other musicians there, Ellis Durand and Josh Omead Mobaraki, who would become members of the band when it formed in 2019. ""They worked together, they were quite a small cohort and quite close,"" Mr Pontin said.  As time progressed they got on to the gigging circuit and performed twice weekly. ""There was lots going on, lots of opportunity,"" the music teacher added.  Although going to the mainland was difficult because of transport: ""Rushing to get the last ferry back over made it hard, but we used to do as much as we could."" They were ""strong academically and motivated, no doubt about that"", he added. ""They all had a talent, they were a nice bunch of students, a good combination of personalities,"" he continued. ""They deserve the success they've had. Chance does come into it, but so does having the right sound in the right place, at the right time."" Wet Leg might still be adjusting to the adulation.  Speaking after the awards, where they won best alternative music performance and alternative music album, Rhian Teasdale said: ""This is so funny, thank you so much, what are we doing here? I don't know. But here we are. ""We cannot compute. It's very bizarre, very magical."" Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Brit Awards: All Saints' Shaznay Lewis questions all-male best artist category,"Singer Shaznay Lewis has said it ""does not feel right that female artists have suffered"" as a result of category changes at the Brit Awards. Best male and best female have been merged into one best artist category to allow non-binary acts to compete. However, the shortlist for this year's best artist prize is all-male. Lewis, who won two Brits as a member of All Saints, welcomed the awards body's intentions, but said: ""Progressive ideas should benefit everyone."" Writing in the Radio Times, she said: ""How can that be the case if we do not acknowledge female artists, who are symbols of empowerment to millions of young aspiring women?""  The singer and songwriter described the category change as a ""welcome and wonderful step"" for recognising talent regardless of an artist's gender. However, she continued: ""If the Brits are meant to be accolades for all, how can we persist with a category that this year has excluded half of the population, women? I'm hoping it won't be the case in 2024."" Adele was the first winner of the newly-titled artist of the year category in 2022, following the release of her fourth album 30. She said in her acceptance speech: ""I understand why the name of this award has changed but I really love being a woman and being a female artist. I'm really proud of us."" This year, the best artist nominees are Fred Again, Central Cee, George Ezra, Stormzy and Harry Styles.  Female artists such as Charli XCX and Florence + The Machine missed out, although acts like Wet Leg, Nova Twins and Cat Burns are recognised in other categories. Lewis said: ""Women, predictably, have suffered as a result [of merging the categories]. It does not feel right."" She questioned why women faced being ""disregarded and excluded"", and asked whether it was because female artists were not seen as ""equally bankable"" by the music industry. Brits organisers said the changes were made because ""it was time to progress to judging artists solely on the quality and popularity of their work, rather than on who they are, or how they choose to identify"". They said 42% of nominations this year featured women, but that a key factor behind the best artist shortlist was ""unfortunately, there were relatively few commercially successful releases by women in 2022 compared to those by men"". A statement on Monday added: ""We recognise this points to wider issues around the representation of women in music that must also be addressed."" Organisers carry out an annual review of the awards, they said, adding that they would examine the artist of the year question after this year's ceremony on Saturday. ""We are wholeheartedly committed to a considered review of the categories over the immediate months following this year's event, and this will include industry consultation and discussion, in line with what we instigated over the past five years, with any conclusions and actions made ahead of the 2024 event."" However, they suggested more time may be needed to assess whether women are at a disadvantage. The statement said: ""We believe that any changes made to award categories should be carefully evaluated over time. Last year Adele was voted the inaugural AOTY, and women triumphed in 10 out of the 15 categories."" All Saints won best single and best video for their hit Never Ever at the Brit Awards in 1998.  Both categories were gender neutral and saw the girl group compete against male acts such as Elton John, Blur, Radiohead, Oasis and David Bowie.  However, the existence of gendered categories that year meant there were other guaranteed female winners, with Shola Ama winning best British female solo artist and Bjork winning best international female. Lewis said the group were hugely proud of their accomplishment, writing: ""We played a major part in ensuring that the Brits was a space for women to thrive. Is that still the case?"" The two awards won by All Saints were voted for by the public - but most of the winners and nominees at the ceremony are chosen by the Brits Voting Academy, which is made up of about 1,200 members.

Beyoncé North America pre-sale begins with Ticketmaster under scrutiny,"The first batch of tickets for the North American dates of Beyoncé's world tour went on sale on Monday, with huge demand as expected. The star, who won a record-breaking 32nd Grammy Award on Sunday, has not held a solo tour since 2016. It is seen as the first major test for Ticketmaster since the company's system was overwhelmed by demand for Taylor Swift tickets late last year. Ticketmaster apologised to Swift and her fans last month. The company tweeted an update ahead of the initial sales in which they said they had increased their defences since ""scalpers will likely unleash a record level of bot attacks"".  William Robertson, a cyber-security professor at Northeastern University, said touts have likely been ""overwhelming Ticketmaster with network traffic"". He explained that defending against bots is an active area of security research, but there is no silver bullet yet. ""It's probably unreasonable to expect that Ticketmaster can stop all bot attacks,"" he said. The ticket giant has been live tweeting when new pre-sale access codes are sent out to eager fans. Some expressed their joy at securing tickets, while others were waiting anxiously. One fan wrote: ""I got my Beyoncé tickets... after being stressed for days waiting to get an email or message for the [access] code, I got the code 2 minutes into the sale & was able to secure a ticket!"" The company earlier said it had changed its process for the North American legs of Beyoncé's 43-date Renaissance tour following the Taylor Swift issues in November. Fans were asked to register for Ticketmaster's Verified Fan process - which the company says will filter out touts - before the first pre-sale opened on Monday. The deadline to register was Sunday, and those that managed to do so ahead of time were entered into a ""lottery-style process"" after demand outstripped the number of available tickets. Some who registered were placed on a waiting list, the company said.  If there are remaining tickets after those on the waiting list have been offered a chance to buy, then they will go on general sale. But the possibility of that seems increasingly rare - Ticketmaster noted that demand was 800% higher than supply, based off registration.   Beyoncé will kick-off her North American dates in Toronto on 8 July, playing regular shows until her final date in New Orleans on 27 September. A UK general sale will begin on Tuesday. The star is set to play five UK stadium shows in Cardiff, Edinburgh, Sunderland and London. Politicians in the US, who are already investigating Ticketmaster over the fumbled sale of Taylor Swift's Eras tour, will be closely watching how the systems cope with Beyoncé's concerts. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing last month to investigate a ""lack of competition"" in the ticketing industry following the Taylor Swift problems. The committee earlier tweeted ""we're watching"" at Ticketmaster in response to a post announcing the Beyoncé tour. The company apologised during the congressional hearing. ""We need to do better and we will,"" Joe Berchtold, president of Live Nation, Ticketmaster's parent company, said. Ticketmaster, which merged with Live Nation in 2010, has repeatedly faced criticism from fans and politicians, who say it has too much control over the live music market and artificially inflates the cost of tickets with fees and service charges.

Fleetwood Mac: Mick Fleetwood thinks band is 'done' after Christine McVie's death,"Mick Fleetwood has said it is currently ""unthinkable"" for Fleetwood Mac to continue as a band following the death of Christine McVie. The drummer told reporters on the Grammy Awards red carpet that he thinks the legendary band is probably ""done"". ""I think right now, I truly think the line in the sand has been drawn with the loss of Chris,"" Fleetwood said. ""I'd say we're done, but then we've all said that before. It's sort of unthinkable right now."" Keyboardist, singer and songwriter McVie died in November aged 79 following a short illness. Fleetwood said the remaining band members were currently focusing on other musical projects, adding: ""They all get out and play, so I'm gonna be doing the same thing, finding people to play with."" During the In Memoriam segment of Sunday's Grammys, Fleetwood performed the McVie-written Fleetwood Mac single Songbird with Sheryl Crow and Bonnie Raitt. Fleetwood said he plans to still perform in the future, but ""not as Fleetwood Mac"". The band did continue after McVie left in 1998, before she returned in 2014. Her last show with the band was at a tribute concert for founding member Peter Green at the London Palladium in 2020. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-64545097
Dunard Centre: Work begins on site of new concert hall in Edinburgh,"Work has begun to clear the site for Edinburgh's first purpose-built music venue in more than 100 years. The £75m Dunard Centre will be located behind Dundas House off St Andrew Square and host classical, pop, rock, jazz and electronica concerts. The 1,000-seat venue, set to open by 2026, will be the biggest built in the capital since the Usher Hall in 1914. It will be home to the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and play a key role in the Edinburgh International Festival. Gavin Reid, head of the SCO, told BBC Scotland the city has ""needed a modern, acoustically brilliant, mid-sized concert hall for a long time, and that is what we are getting"". ""Great acoustics brings great musicians and great experiences to life,"" he said. ""You experience music in technicolour glory. ""It is not simply classical music though. There will all genres to suit all styles and tastes; it is going to be somewhere for everyone."" Amended plans - with the height of the new building reduced after objections from the neighbouring St James Quarter - were given the green light in November 2021.  The Royal Bank of Scotland, which is helping to fund the project, formally handed over the land on the New Town site in late January. It is expected all clearance work on the 1960s annexe of the RBS headquarters at 36 St Andrew Square, levelling the site, will be completed later this year. Construction of the new concert hall will start soon afterwards. SCO cellist Su-a Lee delivered a performance on the site of the new venue, in front of a small group of construction workers, to mark work getting under way. ""Performing in a brilliantly created acoustic is a wonderful experience for a musician,"" she said.  ""When Dunard Centre opens, it will give musicians a very special place to perform music of all genres."" Nagata Acoustics, whose previous projects include concert halls in Los Angeles, Paris and Hamburg, have been working with David Chipperfield Architects on the auditorium design.  The building will be open both day and night and will have a café. The project is being funded through substantial private donations, and Royal Bank of Scotland, which is providing a long-term lease for the land. The UK and Scottish governments are each providing £10m, with the City of Edinburgh Council contributing £5m. A campaign has been launched to secure the remaining funds required before construction begins later this year. Council leader Cammy Day told BBC Scotland he ""couldn't see"" the council providing any more resources to cover any over-running costs. But he said he was confident that those already on board would ensure the project is ""properly funded and a success"". ""It is important to celebrate a new addition to the cultural estate in the capital city which is long overdue,"" he added. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-64535986
Sir Salman Rushdie speaks for the first time about 'colossal attack',"Sir Salman Rushdie has spoken for the first time about being stabbed last year at an event in New York. In an interview with The New Yorker, Sir Salman said he was ""lucky... my main overwhelming feeling is gratitude"". The award-winning novelist was attacked on stage ahead of a speech in August and spent six weeks in hospital. He subsequently lost vision in one eye. Sir Salman has long faced death threats for his 1988 novel The Satanic Verses. In a wide-ranging interview with David Remnick, the novelist said: ""I've been better. But, considering what happened, I'm not so bad.  ""The big injuries are healed, essentially. I have feeling in my thumb and index finger and in the bottom half of the palm. I'm doing a lot of hand therapy, and I'm told that I'm doing very well."" But he said it was difficult to type and to write due to a lack of feeling in some of his fingertips.   ""I'm able to get up and walk around. When I say I'm fine, I mean, there are bits of my body that need constant check ups. It was a colossal attack."" He said he also has mental scars from the attack and that he is having to rethink his approach to security, having lived without it for more than two decades. ""There is such a thing as PTSD, you know,"" he said. ""I've found it very, very difficult to write. I sit down to write, and nothing happens. I write, but it's a combination of blankness and junk, stuff that I write and that I delete the next day. I'm not out of that forest yet, really.""  The man suspected of stabbing Sir Salman, Hadi Matar, has been charged with attempted murder.  Sir Salman was forced into hiding for nearly 10 years after The Satanic Verses was published in 1988.  Many Muslims reacted with fury to it, arguing that the portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad insulted their faith. He faced death threats and the then-Iranian leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, issued a fatwa - or decree - calling for Sir Salman's assassination, placing a $3m (£2.5m) bounty on the author's head. The fatwa remains active, and although Iran's government has distanced itself from Mr Khomeini's decree, a quasi-official Iranian religious foundation added a further $500,000 (£416,000) to the reward in 2012. Remnick asked Sir Salman if he thinks he should have been more on guard after moving to New York in 2000, having previously lived underground for several years. ""Well, I'm asking myself that question, and I don't know the answer to it,"" he said. ""I did have more than 20 years of life. So, is that a mistake? Also, I wrote a lot of books."" Rushdie's latest novel, Victory City was finished just before the attack and is being published later this week. ""I've always tried very hard not to adopt the role of a victim,"" he said. ""Then you're just sitting there saying, 'somebody stuck a knife in me! Poor me'... Which I do sometimes think!"" ""But what I don't think is: That's what I want people reading the book to think. I want them to be captured by the tale, to be carried away."" Analysis by Katie Razzall, BBC culture and media editor For all of us who have marvelled at his work since his Booker prize winning Midnight's Children revolutionised the British novel, it's good to hear Rushdie's voice, sounding as it ever did - witty, fiercely eloquent, thoughtful, and, crucially, uncowed. This magnificent novelist has always wanted to be judged for his writing. The events of his life though have made that impossible. But, as he publishes his 21st novel, Victory City, he clearly has no intention of allowing what's happened to destroy him as an artist, to silence him. ""I could write scared books"" in reaction, he muses, ""a book that shies away from things because you worry about how people will react to them"".  Rushdie claims there are a lot of books like that at the moment. But not his. And in Victory City, a magical realist epic about a goddess who creates a city from seeds and lives to the age of 247, the writer has his eyes on the country of his birth - with a swipe at the current Indian government.  This book was finished before the attack.   Now the attack may end up as a future novel from this master storyteller who believes the purpose of art is to bring joy. Perhaps it will be cathartic. ""Writing about the event gives me an artistic reason to think about it,"" he says. Rushdie will make sense of it on his own terms - and bring us joy out of the barbarity. Rushdie is aware Victory City will have to compete with his recent real-life drama. ""I'm hoping that to some degree it might change the subject. I've always thought that my books are more interesting than my life,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, the world appears to disagree."" He talks about how the book, set in 14th Century southern India, can be read as an allegory about the abuse of power and the curse of sectarianism. Sir Salman is critical of the country's current prime minister, Narendra Modi. ""The Modi government is very popular. It has huge support. And that makes it possible for them to get away with everything… to create this very autocratic state, which is unkind of minorities. Which is fantastically oppressive of journalists. Where people are very afraid. ""It's getting difficult to call it a democracy."" You can read the full interview in the New Yorker and listen to the accompanying podcast.

City transformed for Netflix World War Two film,"Parts of Bradford are going back in time as they are transformed into war-torn Birmingham for a major new film.Six Triple Eight will tell the story of 6888th battalion, the only all-black, all-female American battalion of World War TwoThe film, for Netflix, stars Oprah Winfrey, Susan Sarandon and Kerry Washington and is being directed by Tyler Perry.Filming in Bradford's Little Germany area is expected to take place next week. The 6888th Postal Directory Battalion was formed in 1945 as there was a significant shortage of soldiers able to manage the postal service for the US Army.The unit, consisting of more than 800 women, sailed to the UK in February 1945, arriving first in Glasgow before travelling on to Birmingham, where they would be based. In Birmingham, they found piles of undelivered mail from US forces to loved-ones back home.""Facing discrimination, unfamiliar land, and a war-torn country, they persevered and sorted over 17 million pieces of mail, reconnecting American soldiers with their families and loved ones back home,"" Netflix said in publicity for the film.The women created their own motto ""No Mail, Low Morale"" to show how important they believed getting those letters delivered was. After sorting mail in the UK the battalion was moved to France to begin tackling a second backlog.The unit was disbanded after the war in 1946 and received little recognition for their work.However, in 2022 President Jo Biden signed a bill for the women to receive Congress' highest honour, the Congressional Gold Medal.

Tems wins Grammy: Nigerians celebrate rap award,"Top Nigerian artists have joined music fans from across the world to congratulate singer Tems on winning a Grammy award.  She won the Best Melodic Rap Performance category for her contribution to the hit song Wait for U with Future and Drake. They beat a strong field which included Kendrick Lamar and DJ Khaled.  Artists including Tiwa Savage, Waje and Omowunmi have posted messages congratulating Tems.  ""It's Tems' time. Nobody can stop her shine. Superstar,"" posted Afrobeats singer Olamide.  Some fans on Twitter have been hailing her as the first Nigerian female artist to win a Grammy.  However, others argue that historic first was achieved by British-Nigerian singer Sade, whose real name is Helen Folasade Adu. She has won the award four times. Tems, 27, whose real name is Temilade Openiyi, has experienced a remarkable rise. She self-produced her debut single, Mr Rebel, in 2018, which led to an almost instant fan base called Rebel Gang, who appreciated its unique sound and faster pace compared to other female Nigerian singers. Just over four years later, she's a Grammy winner with a list of collaborations with notable international artists.  Featuring on WizKid's 2020 single Essence helped propel her to global prominence when the song reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Dubbed the song of the summer, it saw her fan base expand beyond Africa. She is reportedly working on collaborations with several mega starts including Beyoncé and Rihanna. Her vocal talent has been praised by fellow artists. DJ Edu, host of BBC's music show This Is Africa, said Tems has a ""unique"" style.  ""It's great to see Tems getting this recognition. She's always stood out from the crowd, being true to her own unique sound and style, and I'm really happy she's achieved such heights without having to conform,"" he told BBC News. ""I nominated her as one to watch in 2020 so obviously I'm basking in her success,"" he added. Meanwhile, South Africans Wouter Kellerman, Zakes Bantwini and Nomcebo Zikode also won a Grammy Award - for Best Global Music Performance for their collaboration Bayethe.

Shetland pianist becomes Young Traditional Musician 2023,"A pianist who started playing traditional music as a way to feel connected to her home, has won one of the biggest prizes in the music genre. Amy Laurenson was named BBC Radio Scotland Young Traditional Musician 2023 after a hard-fought final. The 23-year-old's skills saw off five other finalists at the City Halls in Glasgow. She won a recording session and performance opportunity which will boost her music career. Amy, who is originally from Shetland, moved to Glasgow in 2017 to study classical piano at The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. Two years into her studies, she became hooked on traditional music, switching departments and working to earn a first-class honours degree in traditional music.  She told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme the win was beginning to sink in. ""Being part of the competition was such a great experience, just spending time with such amazing musicians and folk I met along the way - it was really special."" The competition journey started last year when Amy submitted a 10-minute performance. She was selected for the semi-finals in November and has been preparing for the final ever since. Six finalists performed for the live broadcast on BBC Radio Scotland and BBC Alba as part of Celtic Connections. Amy paid tribute to the outstanding talent of her fellow finalists. ""Such outstanding playing from everybody,"" she said. ""There are some really amazing people that were part of the competition. I think we are faced with a really good situation at the moment. there is so much innovation going in within the scene, and that's really great to see."" Amy started playing the piano when she was seven. It was moving to Glasgow from Shetland that inspired her love for traditional music. ""It was the connection it gave to me with my home"" she said. ""Shetland is something I admire and I am so drawn to, so being able to explore that connection through music is what got me to traditional music in the first place."" Amy has played for a number of Shetland festivals as well as occasional ceilidhs and sessions in and around Glasgow.  As part of the 2023 award, Amy wins a recording session with BBC Scotland, an opportunity to perform at the Scots Trad Music Awards later in the year, plus a one-year membership of the Musicians Union. She said: ""It feels like the next chapter is opening up. I am hoping to record some solo music this year and continue gigging with my band."" Only last week, Amy gave up her part-time job to pursue music full-time. The other five finalists were guitarist Aidan Moodie from Orkney, piper Ailis Sutherland from Kirriemuir, Angus, Islay singer Mairi McGillivray, Glasgow-based accordion player Sam Mabbett and American fiddler Madeleine Stewart who lives in Glasgow. All finalists get a one-year membership to the Traditional Music and Song Association of Scotland (TMSA) plus the opportunity to take part in the TMSA's annual Young Trad Tour. Organised by BBC Radio Scotland, the Young Traditional Musician competition has been increasing the profile of Scottish traditional music and recognising rising talent in the genre since 2001. The contest is renowned as one of the biggest platforms for emerging talent in traditional music and has been a springboard for numerous Scottish traditional music exponents to international acclaim. Amy Laurenson joins a list which recently has included amongst others the 2022 winner fiddler Eryn Rae, pianist Michael Biggins, piper Ali Levack, fiddler Benedict Morris and singer Hannah Rarity.

Happy Valley: TV critics and viewers praise 'sensational' finale,"The climax of Happy Valley after three series has been described by TV critics as ""a sensational end to a truly great drama"" and ""a heart-stopping triumph"". The final episode was watched by an average audience of 7.5 million, according to overnight ratings. Reviewers and viewers alike praised the BBC drama as it reached its conclusion. The Guardian's Lucy Mangan called the final episode ""brutal, tender, funny, compelling and heartbreaking to the last"" in her five-star write-up. It was ""a finale of understated, heartbreaking brilliance"", agreed the Telegraph's Anita Singh. ""Not since Line of Duty has a drama finale been so eagerly awaited. Thankfully it didn't end like Line of Duty,"" Singh added, referring to the divisive conclusion of the other police drama's latest series. ""Instead, show creator Sally Wainwright delivered an ending that satisfied."" The scriptwriter did ""challenge our perspective"", Singh added, although she ultimately decided the finale ""was not the most gripping episode of this series"". ""For heart-stopping drama, Royce's escape from court was the high point,"" she continued. ""But it showed everything we loved about Catherine Cawood: Her toughness, her vulnerability, her sense of humour."" Sarah Lancashire has received acclaim for playing the no-nonsense Sgt Cawood, as has James Norton for his role as her nemesis, the criminal Tommy Lee Royce. The pairing of Wainwright and Lancashire helped make the show great, Mangan wrote. ""Separately, they are brilliant. Together, they are invincible."" For the West Yorkshire-set show's swansong, Wainwright delivered ""neat but truthful resolutions to every part of the story,"" the critic added. ""It had redemption, justice, bitter laughs and fire in its blood."" ""Neil could be Tommy's dad."" ""Alison will die."" ""Tommy escapes by riding in the Tour De France as it comes through Hebden Bridge."" Those were three of the entries in a predict-the-ending competition at the Shoulder of Mutton. The pub, which is in the centre of Hebden Bridge and featured in briefly in the show (over Catherine Cawood's shoulder in series two, episode three), hosted a final night viewing party. No popcorn, but a huge plate of Yorkshire puddings arrived in time for Jake Bugg's theme. ""This is the most dramatic TV since JR was shot,"" said landlady Lesley Wood, harking back to the famous 1980 Dallas storyline. Throughout the episode there were gasps aplenty, I spied someone literally hiding behind a cushion, and the end credits were greeted with a round of applause.  And crucially, no-one won the predict-the-ending competition. Or even came close.  In The Times, Carol Midgley declared that the last instalment was ""immaculately written and beautifully performed"" as well as ""exquisitely bleak and, surely, Bafta-winning"". Although she, too, gave it five stars, Midgley did say: ""It wasn't a perfect episode. Not enough time was given to tying up the loose ends of Faisal the dodgy pharmacist and Rob the violent PE teacher."" But she concluded: ""Thank you, Happy Valley. I doubt we'll see your unique brand of sorrow again."" The i newspaper's Rachael Sigee also handed out the full five stars for what she said was ""an utterly gut-wrenching episode"". She added: ""Sally Wainwright's exceptional dialogue didn't let up for a second as she concluded a story that has spanned almost a decade."" The finale is expected to have attracted big ratings. The first episode of the third series has now been watched by more than 10.5 million people, including on live TV on New Year's Day and on iPlayer since. Sunday's nail-biting ending also earned widespread praise from viewers on social media. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-64533515
Grammys 2023: Kim Petras and Sam Smith break record and other takeaways,"The 65th Grammy Awards took place in Los Angeles overnight, with awards going to everyone from Ozzy Osbourne and Adele to Willie Nelson and Beyoncé. Harry Styles picked up the coveted best album prize, Viola Davis completed an EGOT, and Beyoncé became the most decorated artist in Grammy history.  Here are five of the high and low points of a ceremony that had more twists and turns than a helter skelter in a hall of mirrors. Every time Beyoncé releases a new album, she rewrites the rule book for everybody else. From her self-titled visual album in 2013, and the confessional masterpiece that was 2016's Lemonade, to last year's disco fantasia Renaissance, she has changed the way that pop music is written, produced, released, presented and promoted. She does so with awe-struck admiration from her peers. ""You clearly are the artist of our lives!"" declared Lizzo at tonight's ceremony, echoing words Adele said in 2017. During the ceremony, Beyoncé picked up a record-breaking 32nd trophy. She was already tied with her husband Jay-Z as the most-nominated artist of all time (they have 88 each). But for all that love, the big prizes have eluded her. Of the 16 times she's been nominated in the major, all-genre categories, she has won just once: Song of the year in 2010, for Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It). This year, Renaissance was the presumed front-runner for album of the year. A deep and affectionate dive into black and gay dance culture, it was the most critically-acclaimed release of 2022.  But, for the fourth time in her career, Beyoncé was beaten to the top honour. This time Harry Styles took the crown. Previously, it was Beck, Adele and Taylor Swift. What's the message the Grammys are trying to deliver here? Because it seems to be: ""Stop being so impressive and write music we feel comfortable with"". It's a sentiment that's not entirely out of character. The industry created the awards in 1958 to promote ""good"" music amid the terrifying onslaught of rock and roll and, ever since, the Grammys have lagged behind every major movement in music.  Famously, The Beatles won more awards after they split up than they did together; and there were no rap categories until 1989. So maybe, one day, when she's in her 60s, Beyoncé will get her dues. Warning: Lizzo's speech contains strong language It wasn't a great night for speechmaking.  Ozzy Osbourne made me laugh with a brusque, ""Thank you and [expletive] off"", but otherwise, there was a lot of thanking your mum and being ""so inspired"" by all the other nominees. Luckily, Lizzo was on hand to give everyone a big old pep talk. ""Let me tell you something,"" she began, as she picked up Record Of The Year.  ""Me and Adele are just having a good time, enjoying ourselves and rooting for our friends. ""But now that I'm up here... I want to dedicate this award to Prince. ""When we lost Prince I decided to dedicate my life to making positive music. This was at a time when positive music and feel-good music wasn't mainstream and I felt very misunderstood. I felt on the outside looking in. But I stayed true to myself because I wanted to make the world a better place. ""And now I look around and there's all these songs that are about loving our bodies and feeling comfortable in our skin and I'm just so proud to be a part of it.  ""Because in a world that is a lot of darkness and a lot of scary [stuff], I'd like to believe that not only can people do good, but we just are good, we are good inherently."" Special mention to Wet Leg's drummer Henry Holmes, who gave the night's most honest speech.  ""This is just a magical evening. My mind has gone blank, and I feel like I might wet myself."" Don't be confused by the look that he's got / He's just Benny from the block. The newly-married Mr J. Lo attended the Grammys to support his wife and looked thoroughly, unequivocally bored with the whole thing. Shots of him staring, unmoved at Stevie Wonder (Stevie Wonder!) while Jennifer Lopez danced in her seat quickly trended on social media.  ""However bad of a day you're having, I promise you're not as miserable as Ben Affleck at the Grammys right now,"" wrote one observer. ""You can see his batteries draining in real time,"" added another. This August marks 50 years since DJ Kool Herc and his sister Cindy threw a party in the Bronx that's considered the birthing ground of hip-hop. To mark the occasion, the Grammys threw a special performance that crammed the stage with legend after legend after legend. Kicking off with Grandmaster Flash's Flash to the Beat and The Message, the 12-minute medley made room for Run-DMC, Salt-N-Pepa, Public Enemy, De La Soul, DJ Jazzy Jeff (scratching his way through Rock The Bells) Rakim, Ice-T, Method Man, an exquisitely-choreographed Missy Elliot, Queen Latifah and The Lox. Busta Rhymes stole the show with a rapid-fire, syllable-spewing verse of Look At Me Now, while Nelly upped the fun factor with the goofy Hot In Herrre. Everything was brought up to date with Lil Baby's Freestyle and GloRilla's F.N.F. (Let's Go) before Lil Uzi Vert closed the set with a snippet of Just Wanna Rock. ""We started in the Bronx,"" declared LL Cool J over the closing bars. ""And ever since, we've gone everywhere."" It was the undoubted highlight of the night... but there was a glaring absence from Drake and Eminem, both of whom are boycotting the Grammys, saying it sidelines hip-hop from the major categories. To date, Childish Gambino's This Is America is the only hip-hop song to win song of the year; while Outkast's Speakerboxxx / The Love Below was the last rap album to scoop album of the year, back in 2004. A tribute is one thing, but the Grammys still have a long road to travel. Sam Smith and Kim Petras won best pop duo/group collaboration for their campy sex melodrama Unholy - which they also performed, with Smith dressed as the devil for good measure. But the British singer ceded the microphone to Petras at the winner's podium, watching with pride as she delivered her speech. ""Sam graciously wanted me to accept this award because I'm the first transgender woman to win this award,"" Petras said, her face covered in a red satin veil.  She went on to thank the pioneers and activists who ""kicked the doors open"" - a list that would include Wendy Carlos, the first transgender woman to win a competitive Grammy back in 1970, for her pioneering synth album Switched-On Bach. Backstage, she still couldn't get over the sense of occasion. ""All these years are going through my head of people saying I'd be a niche artist because I'm transgender, and my music would only ever play in gay clubs - and what's wrong with that, because I love gay clubs - but now I got a Grammy for making gay club music with my friend,"" she said.  ""It's the best feeling in the world."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-64535376
Record-breaking Beyoncé gets emotional at Grammys,,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-64535136
Grammys 2023: The ceremony in pictures,"The 65th annual Grammy Awards took place in downtown Los Angeles on Sunday evening. Here's how the action unfolded. The awards kicked off with an explosive performance from Puerto Rican singer and rapper Bad Bunny (pictured above), which - set against a tropical background - featured pyrotechnics and scores of Latino dancers. It got the star-studded audience, including Taylor Swift, up on their feet. ""Thank you so much. This album, from start to finish, has been the greatest experience of my life,"" said the star on stage.  His album, Un Verano Sin Ti, went on to win the award for best Música Urbana album; and Bad Bunny went on to pose with fellow Grammy-winner Taylor Swift.  Referring to Bad Bunny's opening number, host and comedian Trevor Noah joked: ""That album is so fire it makes [Donald] Trump want to learn Spanish."" He also poked fun at Harry Styles' fashion sense, joking: ""Women throw their panties at this man, then he puts them on and looks better in them."" Noah went on to formally introduce another pop superstar, Adele, to one of her biggest fans (quite literally in this instance) in the form of actor Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. ""Adele meet The Rock, The Rock meet Adele,"" said Noah, drawing laughter from the audience, as the two shared a rather cute if not slightly embarrassing impromptu embrace. Harry Styles scooped the first major gong of night - best pop vocal album for his latest LP Harry's House. ""This album from start to finish has been the greatest experience of my life. Thank you so much,"" said the British star, accepting the award from Jennifer Lopez. Styles later took to the stage for an energetic performance of his double-Grammy nominated track As It Was. Wearing a long tasselled silver shirt and matching trousers, he shimmered as he charged around the stage, joined by a troupe of dancers on a rotating platform. His night was capped by being handed the coveted album of the year award by a septugenarian super-fan. Beyoncé then tied with conductor Georg Solti as the most decorated artist in Grammys history, after winning best R&B song for Cuff It. She was not on hand to collect the award in person, after getting stuck in traffic. But she did arrive in time to collect her next award for best best dance/electronic music album. The win made her the most decorated Grammys artist of all time, with 32. Another British star, Sam Smith,  shifted the spotlight onto their collaborator Kim Petras after she became the first transgender woman to win a Grammy. The pair took home best pop duo/group performance, for their erotically-charged track Unholy - which they later performed on a devilishly flame-filled stage. ""Sam, I love you so much and this song has been such an incredible journey for me,"" said the German singer. She went on to thank the ""transgender legends"" who had ""kicked open the doors"", as well as Madonna - who introduced them on stage - and her own mother. Kendrick Lamar thanked his family too after winning the Grammy for best rap album, for Mr Morale & The Big Steppers."" First and foremost I want to thank my family for giving me the courage and vulnerability to share my truth with this album,"" he said, accepting the award. He went on to thank his fans too for ""trusting me with these stories"", describing it as ""one of the toughest records"" he had made. After Shania Twain accepted the award for best country album on behalf of 89-year-old absentee Willie Nelson, the Grammys remembered some of the famous faces we lost over the past 12 months - including Fleetwood Mac star Christine McVie, guitarist Jeff Beck and Migos rapper Takeoff. The soundtrack to the emotional on-screen tribute was provided by Kacey Musgraves, Mick Fleetwood and Sheryl Crow, as well as Takeoff's uncle Quavo. Adele got emotional as she won the award for best pop solo performance, honouring her hit song Easy On Me. ""Well thank you. I really was just looking forward to coming tonight,"" said the singer, after accepting the award from her new ""best friend"" Dwayne Johnson. The biggest live performance of the night came courtesy of Missy Elliot, Busta Rhymes, Grandmaster Flash and dozens of other figures from the rap world, who combined on stage to herald the 50-year history of hip-hop. The special segment, which charted the evolution of the genre from its roots in New York City to the most popular genre in the world, was clearly appreciated by the likes of Adele, Jay-Z and Lizzo, who rapped along from the front rows. After winning the award for record of the year, for About Damn Time, US singer Lizzo singled out Beyoncé for having ""changed my life"". Addressing the star directly, Lizzo said she had once skipped school to watch her perform. ""The way you made me feel,"" she said, ""I wanted to make people feel the same way with my music."" Country, blues and folk singer Bonnie Raitt won the song of the year award, for her track, Just Like That. ""I'm so surprised,"" said the 73-year-old. ""I don't know what to say. This is just an unreal moment."" Earlier in the evening, at the ""premiere"" show before the main event, folk rocker Brandi Carlile scored three awards. ""Oh my God, this is amazing. Oh, I'll never be the same,"" she said on stage. ""I cut my hair and I learned how to scream and I just won a Grammy for a rock and roll song!"" She went on to rock out at the main show. Also during the premiere ceremony, actress Viola Davis became the 18th person to achieve the EGOT - winning an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Award. Davis completed her collection by winning best audio book for her autobiography Finding Me. ""I wrote this book to honour the six-year-old Viola,"" said the star. ""To honour her life, her joy, her trauma, everything."" Isle of Wight indie duo Wet Leg, meanwhile, swept the board with the alternative music categories, but ultimately lost out to Samara Joy for the best new artist prize. ""This is so funny, thank you so much. What are we doing here? I don't know,"" shrugged singer and guitarist Rhian Teasdale, while accepting their first award. ""But here we are.""

Bristol refugees share stories through theatre project,"A theatre project is giving a platform to refugees and helping them gain confidence in telling their stories. The Phosphoros theatre wants to amplify the voices of refugees and has come to Bristol to work with local charity Borderlands. The groups put together a performance that will be seen at the Old Vic in Bristol on 3 and 4 February. Talal, who is 22 and from Sudan, said the project helped him ""learn about how to feel confident"". ""When I came to this country, I wanted to integrate and I wanted to learn about how to communicate my story to others,"" Talal said. ""I'm proud of myself. I see myself as a representative of refugees like me who are similar and have had similar experiences to me.""  ""This is something that is rarely seen on stage at the theatre, on-screen and in the media so I think the project is really important,"" he added. Imy Franklin at Borderlands said: ""The participants enjoyed having a way of sharing stories."" Ms Franklin said the participants liked working with people from different backgrounds and ""finding some common ground"". ""I think it is a productive and enjoyable way to improve their confidence,"" she said. ""Access to institutions like the theatre is really important."" Ms Franklin added: ""It is great that they have the chance to have fun and learn in a different environment from their usual English classes."" Speaking about the upcoming performance, Talal said: ""I am a bit nervous, but I'm really looking forward to the performances this weekend. I'm ready to perform.""

Grammys 2023: Beyoncé makes history and Harry Styles wins album of the year,"Beyoncé won a record-breaking 32nd Grammy Award, while Harry Styles won album of the year, at this year's ceremony in Los Angeles. Beyoncé made history as she won best dance/electronic album for her euphoric dance opus, Renaissance. In doing so, she overtook Hungarian-British conductor George Solti, whose record of 31 Grammys had stood for more than 20 years. ""I'm trying not to be too emotional,"" said the star, accepting her prize.   ""I'm trying to just receive this night."" She went on to thank her family, including her late uncle Jonny, who helped make her stage outfits before she became famous. Beyoncé has previously said his battle with HIV influenced her interest in dance music, and its historical ties to the LGBTQ community, on Renaissance. Overall, Beyoncé won four prizes at the ceremony - but missed some of the early presentations after getting stuck in gridlocked downtown Los Angeles. ""I'm surprised traffic could stop you,"" joked host Trevor Noah. ""I thought you travelled through space and time."" Despite her success, Beyoncé was once again locked out of the coveted album of the year award. She has now lost the prize four times, most notably in 2017 when her confessional masterpiece Lemonade was beaten by Adele's 25.  At the time, Adele used her acceptance speech to say Beyoncé was the more deserving winner (although she held on to the trophy). This year, Harry Styles took the crown, with Grammy voters recognising the slick, radio-friendly pop of his third record Harry's House.  In his speech, the British star downplayed the importance of the prize.  ""On nights like tonight, it's obviously so important for us to remember that there is no such thing as best in music,"" said the singer. ""I don't think any of us sit in the studio, making decisions based on what is going to get us one of these."" However, he was visibly moved by the honour, adding: ""This doesn't happen to people like me very often, and this is so, so nice."" Earlier in the night, the star also won best pop album - receiving his award with a kiss from Jennifer Lopez.  ""This album from start to finish has been the greatest experience of my life,"" he said. ""From making it with two of my best friends to playing for people has been the greatest joy I could have asked for."" Billed as ""music's biggest night"", the Grammys are the industry's most prestigious awards. Sunday's show was attended by Adele, Taylor Swift, Jay-Z, Shania Twain and Stevie Wonder, with performances from Lizzo, Steve Lacy and Brandi Carlile. British artists had a good night, with indie duo Wet Leg winning two prizes, including best alternative album; and Sam Smith receiving best pop duo/group performance for Unholy, a duet with Kim Petras. Smith's prize was their first Grammy since 2015, when they won four trophies, including best new artist. However, the singer let Petras take the microphone to mark another historical achievement. ""Sam graciously wanted me to accept this award because I'm the first transgender woman to win this award,"" said the German-born singer. She went on to thank the late, transgender pop artist Sophie for ""kicking these doors open"", and Madonna ""for fighting for LGBTQ rights"", before dedicating the award to her mother. ""I grew up next to nowhere in Germany and my mother believed me, that I was a girl,"" she said, as Smith looked on with pride. ""I wouldn't be here without her and her support."" The duo later gave a sultry, BDSM-inspired performance of their ode to infidelity, introduced by Madonna. ""If they call you shocking, scandalous, troublesome, problematic, provocative, or dangerous you're definitely onto something,"" said the star. Adele also won best pop vocal performance for Easy On Me, dedicating the prize to her son Angelo. The singer told the audience she had written the first verse ""in the shower when I was choosing to change my son's life"", by divorcing her then-husband, Simon Konecki. She added: ""I love a piano ballad winning any kind of award because it's very old school and very brave."" Singer-songwriter Bonnie Raitt was the surprise winner of song of the year - beating favourites Taylor Swift and Beyoncé with her sorrowful ballad Just Like That. Voters were undoubtedly moved by Raitt's tender lyrics, in which a woman mourning the death of her son finds comfort from the man who received his heart in a transplant. ""I'm so proud that you appreciate this one,"" said the 72-year-old, accepting her trophy. Bad Bunny opened the show in an explosion of colour, replicating a Puerto Rican fiesta in the aisles of Los Angeles' Crypto.com arena. His medley of El Apagón and Después De La Playa was enhanced with pyrotechnics, dozens of dancers and a troop of cabezudos, the ""bighead"" puppets that march down the streets of San Juan every January. He later won the prize for best Música Urbana album, in recognition of Un Verano Sin Ti, which spent 13 weeks at number one in the US last year. ""I made this album with love and passion, and when you do things with love and passion, everything is easier,"" said the singer. Other performances came from Americana star Brandi Carlile and Lizzo, who gave a gospel-infused take on her current single, Special. She later won record of the year for About Damn Time, and used her speech to honour Prince, who gave her an early break on his song Boytrouble.  ""When we lost Prince, I decided to dedicate my life to making positive music."" She also paid tribute to Beyoncé, calling her ""the artist of our lives"". The in memoriam section gave an emotional send-off to stars like Olivia Newton-John, Irene Cara, David Crosby and Jeff Beck. Kacey Musgraves played a heartfelt version of Coal Miner's Daughter in tribute to the ""Queen of Country"" Loretta Lynn; while Fleetwood Mac star Christine McVie was honoured with a performance of her signature hit, Songbird, by Sheryl Crow, Bonnie Raitt and Mick Fleetwood. And Migos rapper Quavo played Without You - a song he wrote after the tragic death of his nephew and bandmate Takeoff last November.  In a more celebratory moment, the stage was taken over by more than two dozen rap icons, celebrating 50 years of hip-hop. Turntable pioneer Grandmaster Flash kicked off the set with Flash Was On The Beat, cueing up an almost 12-minute trawl through the genre's greatest hits. Run-DMC played Rock The Bells, Public Enemy delivered a verse of Yo, Bum Rush The Show, Missy Elliot swept in for Lose Control and Busta Rhymes gave a show-stopping performance of his high-velocity rap from Chris Brown's Look At Me Now.

Grammys 2023: Red carpet fashion in pictures,"The stars were out in force for the 65th annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday night. Here's a look at the most memorable outfits on the red carpet. Roses are red, violets are blue, Lizzo won an award and performed on stage too. Sam Smith and their colour-coordinated entourage, including Unholy collaborator Kim Petras, turned heads ahead of the main ceremony - where they put on a firey musical display. Taylor Swift sparkled on arrival wearing a sequinned blue gown, while also showing off her midriff. The star picked up four nominations ahead of this year's event, including song of the year for the expanded, re-recorded version of All Too Well, but missed out on the award once again.  Harry Styles had his inkwork on display as he arrived in stylish patterned dungarees. The northern Englishman took home the night's big prize for best album for Harry's House. ""This doesn't happen to people like me very often, and this is so nice,"" he said onstage. Styles graced the Grammys performance stage on Sunday night, as did R 'n' B icon Mary J Blige, who was also nominated for several big awards. Rap stars Cardi B and Offset stepped out in their finest glad rags. Brandi Carlile was up for many of the night's biggest honours, including album and record of the year. Collecting an early award for best rock performance, the suited and booted singer-songwriter noted how she had succeeded by rejecting her mother's advice. ""Mom, I gotta thank you for telling me to stop singing so angry, because I obviously ignored that like I ignored everything you ever told me to do,"" she said with a smile.  ""But I cut my hair, I learned how to scream, and I just won a Grammy for a rock and roll song that I wrote with all my heart."" Bebe Rexha was nominated for best dance/electronic recording for her David Guetta collaboration I'm Good (Blue). Despite that, she wore this pink, plunging gown on the red carpet. It was all white on the night for Shaggy, who was nominated for best reggae album for Com Fly Wid Mi - a collection of Sting-produced Frank Sinatra covers. Leather-clad Doja Cat was nominated for a handful of awards including record of the year for Woman. Singer and songwriter Anitta said she was ""making history"" as the first Brazilian artist to be nominated for best new artist at the Grammys in nearly half a century. Speaking to journalists on the red carpet, she said: ""My whole country is watching and Brazil is waiting for this. For me, the victory is to be here tonight, to be honest."" Elvis Costello's album The Boy Named If was nominated for best rock album and, like all self-respecting rock stars, he wore sunglasses indoors. Mick Fleetwood's outfit was accessorised with a pair of dangling metallic balls - a nod to the cover of his band's classic album Rumours. He was there to pay tribute to his late bandmate Christine McVie. Five-time Grammy winner Shania Twain's hair matched the red carpet at she arrived in a ""fun"" polka dot suit and towering hat by British-American fashion designer Harris Reed. Twain collected the award for best country album on behalf of winner Willie Nelson. ""I am here to represent country music and I am excited,"" she said beforehand. Rap legend LL Cool J introduced a segment marking the 50th anniversary of hip-hop. ""It feels like yesterday I was just a little kid in the basement listening to Cold Crush tapes and now here we are all these years later on, on the biggest stage in the world in hundreds of countries around the world, presenting hip hop the way I think it should be seen by the masses,"" he reflected before the show. Adding: ""For a long time hip hop has been served in a brown greasy paper bag but tonight we're going to serve it on a silver platter, so it feels good."" Pharrell Williams looked happy to be there, rocking up in a fur coat over the top of a matching red jacket and trousers combo. Italian Eurovision winners Maneskin looked sharp but missed out on the best new artist award, which ultimately went to Samara Joy. The same can be said for DJ Khaled, who was nominated for song of the year for his track God Did, losing out to Bonnie Raitt. Though he did get to perform the track on stage alongside collaborators such as Jay-Z, John Legend and Lil Wayne. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Gloucester mother died after post-birth treatment delay,"A father whose wife died after childbirth believes she would still be alive if she had given birth elsewhere. Rana Abdelkarim died at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital in March 2021 after suffering a bleed post-birth. The Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) found there were delays in calling for specialist help. Gloucestershire Royal Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust apologised and said steps have been taken to prevent similar tragedies. Modar Mohammednour, who made a home in Gloucestershire after leaving Sudan with little English, said that in March 2021, his wife attended the maternity unit at 39 weeks into her pregnancy for what she thought was a routine check-up. Mr Mohammednour, 44, said due to language barriers his wife thought she was going ""for a scan and to check on her health"" and then ""come back home"", but in fact she was being sent to be induced. ""Immediately"" after the labour, Ms Abdelkarim suffered heavy bleeding and her condition deteriorated - something Mr Mohammednour said he was ""unaware of"", until he was eventually called into the hospital to speak to a doctor. The family's solicitor Hannah Carr, from Novum Law, said at this point her husband didn't know she had given birth let alone was in a critical condition. According to the investigation by the HSIB, the obstetric team of senior doctors were not told about the drastic change in her condition for almost 30 minutes. Mr Mohammednour said: ""He [the doctor] just came back and said to me: 'I did the best to save her life but I couldn't'.  ""I was feeling - 'I am dreaming'. She was talking to me yesterday. She was so in good health, what happened to my wife?"". An investigation into her death by the HSIB found that once Ms Abdelkarim had been given a drip to speed up labour, regular support from midwives and assessments could not be given to her because the maternity ward was so busy. It also found there was a 53-minute delay from the point of bleeding to administering the first blood transfusion. The HSIB also found Ms Abdelkarim was ""uninformed"" about the reason for her admission, ""consent to induce labour was not given"" and because she was thin and small, staff underestimated how much relative blood volume she was losing. The HSIB said: ""There was no effective communication with Rana and the events that occurred traumatised staff."" Ms Carr said Ms Abdelkarim was at greater risk during childbirth as she had undergone female genital mutilation as a girl. She said that during the birth of her first daughter, ""that was a consideration because Modar"", who was present, ""was able to advocate for her"". Ms Carr said because Mr Mohammednour was absent in the birth of their second daughter and there were poor interpretation services, Ms Abdelkarim and her husband ""didn't understand what was happening"", which ""resulted in a complete breakdown in communication and led, unfortunately in part to her tragic death"". She added: ""The Trust's guidelines for massive obstetric haemorrhage and 'Code Red' were not followed. ""The emergency call bell was not activated when staff observed the mother's bleeding which meant that for almost 30 minutes the obstetric emergency was unknown except to the people in the mother's room."" Mr Mohammednour, who is now bringing up his two daughters alone, said six-year-old Reem asks him ""all the time about her mum."" ""My excuse is just to say to her 'she is in paradise',"" he added. Interpretation problems and the handling of heavy bleeds were highlighted in a report by the Care Quality Commission, following an un-announced inspection of the Gloucestershire Royal NHS Foundation Trust in April 2022.  It found a high number of serious safety incidents involving mothers and babies.  The report also said staff could not always identify when a woman's condition was deteriorating, with women like Laura Bowtell losing her baby Margot after staff failed to identify she should have given birth in a consultant-led unit. The hospital said they had implemented all 10 recommendations made in the HSIB report. Deputy chief executive of the trust, Professor Mark Pietroni, said the service continues to make improvements ""in the interest of patient and staff safety"" after the CQC inspection, including one to one care in labour. He added: ""Tragedies such as these are thankfully rare and it is important to stress that our maternity outcomes are in line with comparable maternity units, nationally."" He said it was ""vital"" for the hospital to ""take every opportunity to understand the factors that might have contributed to such a tragic outcome"" and to ""learn and make care as safe as possible."" The latest published maternity safety data from MBRRACE-UK showed in 2020, the year before Ms Abdelkarim died, Gloucestershire was one of just six trusts in the country that had two ""red flag"" warnings for having stillbirth and newborn death rates more than 5% above the average for similar units. In one case that year, baby Freddie Whewell had his skull fractured in delivery and his brain was starved of oxygen.  An inquest found his mother, Jay Whewell, was third in the queue for an emergency caesarean and Freddie might have lived had he been delivered sooner.  MBRRACE Lead, Professor Elizabeth Draper, told the BBC, stillbirth and neonatal mortality is a fairly rare outcome- so the numbers are quite low - which means some ""natural variation"".  Professor Draper said while being identified as red ""wouldn't necessarily identify them specifically as a unit that has a particular problem"", it is ""really important"" for those units identified as red to ""look at all"" the ""cases of still birth and neonatal mortality"" and ""review the care provided for those cases"". Professor Pietroni said a review was carried out after the MBBRACE-UK report and the trust had ""identified key themes for learning and intervention"". He said the data for 2021 ""shows a marked reduction in stillbirths and neonatal deaths"" and they were ""absolutely committed to delivering the safest possible service"", leaving ""no stone unturned"" in their efforts, ""including exposing"" themselves to ""external reviews"".

One of last NHS dentists in Felixstowe goes private,"One of the last remaining NHS dental practices in a coastal town has told its patients it would only be providing private care from the start of April. In a letter to patients, A W Brown Dental Practice in Felixstowe, Suffolk, said it was moving away from the NHS due to a ""chronic lack of investment"". Marc James, whose family of four is registered there, said it was another ""kick in the teeth"" for working people. The government said it was working to improve NHS dental care. Toothless in Suffolk, which has been campaigning for improved NHS dentistry provision, said the government needed to ""radically reform and fund the NHS dental contract"". A W Brown is one of just two town dental practices which provide NHS dental care, though the second one is no longer accepting new NHS patients. It told patients in the letter it had ""proudly"" provided care under the umbrella of the NHS for many years. But, it said, a ""chronic lack of investment in NHS dentistry by successive governments, coupled with rapidly rising costs and lack of resources"" meant it was moving away from the NHS. It said it would be providing dental care on a private basis only from 1 April. Mr James, 52 said: ""On top of everything else, the cost of diesel, council tax going up, our gas and electricity bills going up, we've now got this. ""It's another kick in the teeth for anyone going to work."" Monica Kendall, 70, who has been a patient at the practice since her 20s, said she was ""very disappointed"" and concerned about finding another dentist. Mark Jones, from Toothless in Suffolk, said it was ""deeply upsetting and worrying"" for all the patients there. He said the group was ""resolute and determined to continue our campaign for an NHS dentist for everyone"". Suffolk Coastal Conservative MP Therese Coffey said she was ""disappointed"" the practice had chosen to withdraw NHS treatment.  The former health secretary said: ""Unfortunately, the government cannot stop dentists from refusing to provide such care.  She added: ""The government has invested in dentistry and will continue to do so, including strengthening the contract with dentists.  ""I am pleased that the local NHS will be taking on responsibility for securing local NHS dental provision, as we want to avoid dental deserts in Felixstowe and the county."" The Department of Health and Social Care said its investment in NHS dental care was backed by more than £3bn a year. It said the number of dentists practising in the NHS had increased and it was taking ""immediate action"" to reduce long waits for urgent and emergency care, and would be publishing a primary care recovery plan.

Anti-knife crime campaign funds bleed control kits,"An anti-knife crime campaigner has raised thousands of pounds to buy 150 bleed control kits following the fatal stabbing of an 18-year-old man. Leanne Reynolds supported Dontae Davis through college prior to his death in Bristol in October 2021. Ms Reynolds said she hoped the kits, which contain items including bandages and tourniquets, could ""potentially save a life"". The kits are being installed at locations in Bristol and Somerset. Similar bleed control kits have already been given out in London and Birmingham. Ms Reynolds, who has worked with disadvantaged young people for more than a decade, started campaigning for the kits shortly after Mr Davis' death. ""I'm realising young people don't want to put their weapons down, so I'm thinking of another angle,"" she said. ""If unfortunately someone does get stabbed or if there's a catastrophic bleed we can use these kits to potentially save a life while we're waiting for emergency services."" She added: ""Hopefully we'll get more funding and get more people involved further down the line because it has to be tackled by everyone."" The first of the kits has now been unveiled at The Salvation Army in Lawrence Hill in Bristol, just metres from the spot where Mr Davis was stabbed. The packages will be kept inside red cabinets which read 'Emergency Bleed Control Kit' and are designed to be easily visible. Omari Cato, an engagement and development worker in Bristol, hopes the time will come when they will no longer be necessary. ""It's sad they [the kits] are up, but the target is to get them down and for young people to live their dreams,"" he said.  ""It's about the young people being heard more and investing more into young people.""  Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Cost of living: 'I couldn't afford heating bill when having chemo',,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-64544357
Cancer patients worried about costs while receiving treatment - charity,"A cancer charity has said patients are increasingly worried about how they are going to feed themselves due to the financial threat faced while having treatment. Rodrigo Fenick, from Macmillan, said he was witnessing people going through hardship on a scale he had not seen in his 25-year career.   The charity's benefits case worker said some were really panicking about money. ""Their heating bill will go up tremendously,"" he said. ""We are not talking about a couple of hundred, but over a couple of hundred pounds.""   Other unexpected costs include wigs or post-surgery clothing.  He added: ""I've never seen the amount of concern from people in terms of 'how am I going to survive? How am I going to feed myself? How am I going to feed my kids?'  ""Then there's the priority, 'do I keep the heating on or do I put the heating off? Do I buy enough basic food to go through the week? What do I go without?'"" Debbie Potts, 55 from west London, has had cancer twice since being first diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2021.   A self-employed virtual assistant, she stopped working for eight months while having chemotherapy while her partner went part-time to look after her. This left them with a quarter of their normal income.  ""We made a choice that we will go without and just look after me beating this awful disease,"" she said. She said they made the choice to not turn the heating on. ""I had four or five months of chemo. I was freezing all the time and I said to Dan (her partner) 'don't turn the heating on because it's one expense we can do without - just give me blankets, I'll be fine'"" she said.   Another cost Ms Potts had to take on was cabs; a weakened immune system meant she was advised to avoid public transport so she ended up spending about £50 a week going to and from the Royal Marsden Hospital. ""I tried to cycle but I was so weak,"" she said adding that some days she managed the journey on her bike, but at other times she could not.   After several months of resisting asking for help, she contacted Macmillan who helped with transport costs and gave her a cost of living grant that helped her pay her heating bill for the winter.   ""It was a godsend,"" she said. Macmillan said it gave away more than £1.2m to London cancer patients in 2021, an increase of 21% on 2020. It expects demand to increase this year.   Mr Fenick said there were benefits available and that energy companies offered schemes for people, but many did not know what was available to them.  But Ms Potts said the benefits system could be too bureaucratic to navigate when undergoing cancer treatment.   ""When you are in the middle of having chemo and you have to emotionally process what you are going through, you don't want to fill out a 32-page form and then it takes another 18 weeks before you even get a yes or a no,"" she said.  ""We are not asking for support for the rest of our lives.  ""We just want that little help, from when we are diagnosed, through the treatment, little into the recovery because we want to get back to work and do the things we love doing, we just want a helping hand, we are not saying give us millions.""  A spokesperson for the Department of Work and Pensions said it was ""committed to getting people the support they're entitled to as quickly as possible, and we will backdate awards to ensure no one misses out"". They said they were also opening up assessments by phone and video, and clearance times had greatly improved, returning to pre-pandemic levels. ""We are also protecting the most vulnerable households across the UK - saving households around £1,300 on energy bills this winter and providing a further £12bn of direct support in 2023-24, including £900 worth of cost of living help for those on means-tested benefits.""

'Progress but more to do' - Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital trust,"A hospital trust says it has made ""significant progress"" since a report found failures in care contributed to the deaths of hundreds of babies. The review at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, led by Donna Ockenden, was the largest of its kind in the history of the NHS. Last year it found a string of catastrophic failures as well as a ""toxic culture"". Trust chief executive Louise Barnett admitted it had ""failed our community"". However, she said while there was still ""more to do"" she believed ""services are safe"". The Ockenden report, published in March, examined cases dating back over 20 years and found more than 200 babies and nine mothers could have been saved. Speaking almost a year since the findings, Ms Barnett said she was grateful to Ms Ockenden ""because we have been able to benefit from the report and make these improvements"". She said there had been a ""massive impact"" on the trust and that it had made a number of changes, including round-the-clock consultant cover on the labour ward and risk assessing every single contact with women. The hospital trust, which is rated inadequate by the Care Quality Commission watchdog, was given 210 actions for improvements, which director of nursing Hayley Flavell said were ""quite complex"" but were being overseen by a specialist committee.  Ms Barnett said the trust had also implemented a culture change programme after a recent staff survey found 32% of respondents would not feel confident to report incidents.  This was highlighted as a particular area of concern in the Ockenden report which uncovered a culture of bullying, anxiety and fear. ""At the heart of that is ensuring that people feel that they can speak out,"" Ms Barnett said. ""Because actually listening to our teams and understanding what their concerns are will help us to ensure that we're delivering great care."" The chief executive also addressed A&E waiting times, which in recent months have been among the longest in England. She said addressing those was ""particularly challenging"" due to the high number of existing patients who were ""medically fit for discharge"", but were not able to leave hospital and free up beds. ""We're working closely with our community teams and our local authorities to try and support those patients to get home or to the right place for them,"" she said, adding the trust hoped to replicate the ""rigour and discipline"" being applied to its maternity services to emergency care as well. ""I'm being honest in saying we have got more to go,"" Ms Barnett said.  ""But we're extremely committed to providing the highest possible standards and we're not giving up on that.""

How the nurses' strike on Tuesday 7 February will affect you,"On Tuesday the NHS in England will be recovering from one of the biggest strikes in its history. But there will not be much respite.  While ambulance workers are back at work, nurses remain on the picket line. The industrial action by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) affects 73 NHS trusts in England, which is which is just over a third of the total.  The government says that the NHS strikes so far have led to 88,000 appointments and operations being cancelled in England.  But the advice remains the same: assume your appointment is going ahead if you haven't been contacted.  Members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) are continuing their walkout over pay in England on Tuesday. A full list of the trusts affected is available on the RCN's website. If you have a hospital appointment in England you should still go, unless told otherwise, according to the NHS. Patients in hospital will be informed how their care will be affected on a ward-by-ward basis. Intensive and emergency care will still be provided, but routine check-ups and other operations may be affected. Services such as chemotherapy, kidney dialysis and intensive care will be staffed, as part of emergency cover. The biggest disruption is likely to be in pre-booked treatment such as hernia repair, hip replacements or outpatient clinics. GP practices will run as normal, and people should go to scheduled appointments. NHS medical director Sir Stephen Powis has said it is ""vital that people do not put off seeking care and come forward for treatment"". Anyone who is seriously ill or injured should still call 999, or call 111 for non-life threatening care. The nurses strikes on each day will last for 12 hours. Remember the action is only in England. Welsh NHS staff suspended their planned strike action following an improved offer from ministers. And the RCN and GMB unions in Scotland have put strike action on hold to allow talks on a 2023 pay offer.

New diagnostic centres planned in Coventry and Warwickshire,"NHS services across Coventry and Warwickshire will benefit from a £34m boost. The funding for three community diagnostic centres (CDC) is aimed at reducing waiting times for procedures such as MRI scans and endoscopies. Health bosses say it is ""vital"" in helping to provide treatment for potentially life-threatening conditions like cancer. The investment means two new facilities will be opened next year. Diagnostic services at the Warwickshire North CDC, next to George Eliot Hospital in Nuneaton, are set to be expanded.  South Warwickshire CDC, based at Stratford-upon-Avon Hospital, has already increased access to CT and MRI scans and a dedicated building will be opened on the hospital site to house the new equipment. In Coventry, a diagnostic centre will be developed at the City of Coventry Health Centre site.  In Rugby, plans have been approved for a new endoscopy unit this summer to increase capacity for CT and ultrasound services. Patients will be referred for diagnostic procedures at CDCs by their GP. ""The new investment will mean more timely and convenient access to vital and potentially lifesaving diagnostic procedures, which is crucial in ensuring that we are able to find and treat illnesses such as cancer quickly,"" said Phil Johns, chief executive officer of Coventry and Warwickshire Integrated Care Board.

Ambulance strike: Morale at rock bottom say paramedics,"Ambulance staff morale is at ""rock bottom"", a striking paramedic has said. Dawn Turner, based in Goole, East Yorkshire, said she and her colleagues were ""saving lives all for £13.83 an hour"", leaving some unable to pay their bills and reliant on food banks. Ms Turner, a paramedic for six years, was among hundreds of ambulance staff who joined picket lines across the country on Monday in a row over pay. The government has said the unions' pay demands were unaffordable. Ms Turner, who is also an official in the GMB union, said the dispute was not just about the government's 4% pay offer. ""Obviously the pay, but [it's] mainly about patient safety and the level of care patients are getting at the moment,"" she said. ""We're queuing in hospitals sometimes for 10 to 12 hours at a time, entire shifts we are unable to get out there and deal with patients out in the community, therefore it's impacting on care."" She said the blame for the walk-out lay with Health Secretary Steve Barclay and not the management of Yorkshire Ambulance Service. She claimed staff were leaving to work in supermarkets and fast food restaurants ""for a better life-work balance and often for a lot more pay"". ""They're saving lives, they're going to save your child's life, your grandma's life, they're delivering babies, they are going to multiple-car RTCs, all for £13.83 an hour,"" she said. ""Many are using food banks; I've had people coming to me crying because they can't manage, they can't pay their bills."" Ambulance staff in Yorkshire have been joined by nurses for the biggest ever day of industrial action in the NHS. Some strikers outside Goole Ambulance Station had left the picket line to respond to emergency calls. Newly-qualified paramedic Shannon Rooke said she was being paid around £13 an hour after 18 months in the job and had £60,000 of student debt. ""I'm starting a 12-hour shift and we don't know when we are going to be finished,"" she said. ""I can't arrange any child care and the amount of time I'm missing from home I can't put my son to bed."" Mr Barclay said ministers had met the recommendations of the independent NHS Pay Review Body. He warned the walkouts this week would ""undoubtedly have an impact on patients and cause delays"". ""The Governor of the Bank of England warned if we try to beat inflation with high pay rises, it will only get worse and people would not be better off,"" he said. ""I have held constructive talks with the trade unions on pay and affordability and continue to urge them to call off the strikes. It is time for the trade unions to look forward and engage in a constructive dialogue about the Pay Review Body Process for the coming year.""

Retrospective pay talks are 'not right' - Barclay,,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64542310
Nurses and ambulance staff striking across region,"Nurses and ambulance staff have been joining strike picket lines across the South West. It is the first time ambulance crews and nurses have walked out on the same day since NHS industrial action started in December. NHS England said it is the biggest round of strikes to have hit the health service. There are picket lines at Torbay, Derriford, Royal Devon, North Devon and the Royal Cornwall Hospitals. Royal College of Nursing members are striking in a third of England's NHS trusts. Scott Jenkin, a nurse anaesthetist at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro, said: ""I'm striking because we need to save the NHS.  ""Nursing staff have been underpaid for at least the last 12 years, they are burnt out from working through Covid and there is now not enough of us."" Paramedic Neil Armstrong was on the picket line in Plymouth and said: ""I just want to reassure the public that today we are responding to category one and category two calls from the picket lines. ""So the highest priority of calls will be responded to and that is probably better than your average day."" Eva Gallego trains intensive care nurses at  the Royal Cornwall Hospital and said: ""We are losing all the experienced nurses out of stress and we are recruiting new nurses that are not having the support that they need to thrive in such a specialised environment.  ""The working conditions are getting much, much worse.  ""People are sicker. They come to us much later so they have deteriorated. ""The waiting times that we have with the ambulances... with getting a bed, with getting someone out of hospital - the whole system is clogged.""  Further strikes will follow later in the week, including a walkout by physiotherapists. NHS Providers chief Sir Julian Hartley said health bosses wanted to see fresh negotiations given that walkouts had been suspended in Scotland and Wales following new pay offers. Health Secretary Steve Barclay said ministers had met the recommendations of the independent NHS Pay Review Body. He warned the walkouts this week would ""undoubtedly have an impact on patients and cause delays"". Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

NHS Strikes: Unite ambulance staff on the picket line,"Members of the Unite union have begun striking in Wales, with talk of a deal described as ""wholly premature"". But ambulance bosses have warned the service still faces ""significant pressure"" and have drafted in military personnel to drive ambulances. Other health unions are set to ballot on a new pay offer from the Welsh government. Unite has strikes planned for 20, 21 and 22 February. The Welsh government said it would continue talks with Unite. Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan said: ""Unite have absented themselves from that table by not suspending their action.  ""And obviously we'll continue to talk to them, but it's a very, very different conversation, and I think it's really important that I make it clear that there is no more money."" She added that negotiations continue ""in detail"" with the other four unions which have postponed strike action, but there was ""a timeframe"" as the offer would use reserves from this financial year. GMB union ambulance members put their walkout on hold last Friday. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN), Royal College of Midwives (RCM) and Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) have also suspended strike action. On Friday, the RCN called off its strikes planned for 6 and 7 February, and said it would put the new deal to a vote of members in Wales in the coming days. RCM has called off strike action set for Tuesday and Friday this week. The Welsh Ambulance Service Trust (WAST) said the continuing strike action by Unite would have an impact asking the public to ""use our services wisely"". ""Members of the public should continue to support us by calling us only in a life-threatening emergency,"" it warned. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham held last-minute talks with Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan on Sunday. She also joined her members on the picket line at an ambulance station in Cardiff on Monday. ""We need to make sure that when the offer goes to the members, it's an offer they can accept. I know my members won't accept this offer,"" she told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast on Monday. ""Although they've given an extra 3%, over half of that is in a lump sum, and not on the actual long-term wages.  ""All we're saying is, put some more of that that's in the lump sum onto the proper wages so that people have got it in their pay packets and they know that it's there forever. ""What we're trying to deal with here, yes is the pay, but also people leaving the service. People are not being retained because of the wages."" Ms Graham does not think the strength of Unite's position has been affected, despite other unions calling off their strikes.  ""We're close, but we do need to move a little bit more on the wages, rather than just a one-off payment, which really in a sense is only for a moment in time and a sticking plaster,"" she said. ""Let's look at how we can save more money from the eye-watering agency bill with people on £60 an hour in some circumstances."" Some striking staff said they had experienced abuse on the picket line, paramedic Kevin Gamlin said. ""We were just on the picket line and people were showing their support. A gentleman in a van pulled straight across the road shouting abuse,"" Mr Gamlin said, adding the man said they should be negotiating rather than picketing.  ""It just feels quite intimidating. We're not just here for pay we're here for patients to have a better experience. In all fairness we've had quite a bit of support as well,"" he added. Twenty military personnel have been drafted in to support the service by driving ambulances. Zoe Codd, Unite's regional officer, said: ""Whilst talks are still ongoing we hope that we can come to an offer that would be accepted by members."" The Welsh government has offered eight health unions an extra 3% in the first year on top of the £1,400 already promised. The additional increase would be backdated to April 2022, with 1.5% of that carried forward and consolidated for future years. The Welsh government said on Sunday that talks were continuing: ""We are pleased by the initial reception to the enhanced pay offer made to health trade unions. ""We continue to engage with them on a number of non-pay commitments to enhance staff well-being,"" it said. ""We again thank those that have participated in the negotiations for their positive engagement and goodwill"". Finance Minister Rebecca Evans told BBC Politics Wales the extra cash to cover the pay offer to NHS staff meant the Welsh government would have ""more difficult choices"" to make in future years. She said extra money for a pay settlement would come from £125m in its reserves in the first year.  Ms Evans said this was the maximum allowed to be withdrawn from reserves in a single year, but the Welsh NHS would then have to find £64m in savings annually to finance the deal. Ms Graham said while senior representatives were not prepared to accept the new offer, ""we are nearly there, I feel"". Despite the suspension of NHS strike action by nurses, midwives and physiotherapists, health boards have warned patients not to expect an immediate return to normality. People are being asked to attend appointments only if they have been contacted, as arrangements could not be made at short notice.  Elsewhere in the UK, England is still facing the biggest week of strikes in NHS history, with nurses and ambulance staff continuing walkouts in many areas.  Unions have accused the UK government of intransigence, with claims that ministers have refused to sit down for pay talks. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64532543
Patient donates winter fuel cash to striking nurses,"A former cancer and sepsis patient has donated his winter fuel payment to support striking nurses at the hospital that treated him.  Outside Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, Peter Cockerill gave £500 to a union representing picket lines.  Members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) walked out in parts of England on Monday along with ambulance staff from unions GMB and Unite. An RCN representative said staff were thankful for the donation.  The RCN is calling for a 19% pay rise, although it has indicated it may meet the government ""halfway"". Health Secretary Steve Barclay has said ministers have met the recommendations of the independent NHS Pay Review Body. The winter fuel payment is made to people born before 26 September 1956 to help them pay heating bills. But Mr Cockerill, a professor who has worked in the medical school at the University of Birmingham for 10 years, said he and his wife had chosen to donate the money ""to the people who looked after me when I nearly died"".  He explained: ""I've had cancer and I've had sepsis in this hospital, so four times I've had to spend a week in hospital being looked after by these nurses."" Olga Leach-Walters from RCN said staff would continue striking ""until the government comes to the table to talk to us"".  She said: ""We want to see staffing changes, we want to see fair pay, we want to see nurses be able to come to work and not feel pressured because there is not enough staff. ""I support colleagues who are... sometimes going to food banks, and they are finding it very difficult; the cost of living is very high.""

"Lack of NHS funding 'heartbreaking', says striking paramedic","An ambulance paramedic has said it is ""heartbreaking"" to see the delays affecting the NHS. Jacqueline Murphy, who has worked for West Midlands Ambulance Service for 23 years, is one of several thousand ambulance workers in England and Wales taking part in strikes. She said the NHS was ""in a terrible state, due to lack of funding"". ""We've had no choice now, we have to make known our concerns about the NHS,"" she added. Ms Murphy was on a picket line in Telford, but said she and her colleagues were still responding to emergency calls. She said it was ""devastating"" to see patients forced to wait for long periods of time in ambulances because of delays at hospitals without free beds. ""I tell them the truth, this is due to lack of funding for the NHS,"" she said. Ms Murphy said she was used to seeing busy times over the winter, but ""nothing like this"" and she believed the NHS had not recovered since Covid-19. ""I think everyone thought once the pandemic was over we would get back to normal, people would be seen, they'd get their treatments and that's not happening and we are striking because of that,"" she said.  Fellow West Midlands Ambulance Service paramedic Mark Smith, from Hereford, said the NHS had been ignored for too long. He served as a paramedic with the RAF in Iraq during both Gulf Wars, and said the dispute was not just about pay but overall funding for the NHS. He said his job had always been hard and stressful, dealing with very sick patients, but it had become harder. ""Now we will rush to a patient on blue lights and sirens. We might be in Hereford, they might be in Kington or even Ludlow and then we rush them to the hospital where we will then sit outside and that can go on for a long period of time,"" he said. ""The problem then is we've got them to the hospital and there are no places in hospital for this individual... this is becoming a daily occurrence... and there is literally nothing you can do. ""They look at you with their eyes, pleadingly - you're just so frustrated. It's heartbreaking. This is not what I signed up for.  ""We've been under-funded and we've had below-inflation pay rises for the last 12 years, yet that's not true of politicians."" Simon Day, a paramedic who lives near Telford, said the wages ""stagnation"" and underfunding of the NHS ""as a whole"" was the root cause of pressures causing high numbers of workers to leave.  ""It's completely demoralising,"" Mr Day, who is branch secretary for the GMB union, said.  Mr Day, 56, spoke to the BBC at the end of a 12-hour shift in which he had spent seven-and-a-half hours looking after one patient unable to get a bed at a hospital.  ""It's just not what we were trained to do,"" he said.  ""Also we will be hearing calls on the radio about category one responses so we have to take on board the guilt of that as well."" Mr Day believes the public understand workers are striking, not just about pay, but how the situation impacts care.  ""I think the public fully understand that ambulance workers and NHS workers want to provide, not a minimum standard of care but the best stand of care they can,"" he said.  Monday marks the NHS' biggest day of strikes this winter with ambulance staff in the GMB and Unite unions involved, as well as Royal College of Nursing (RCN) members in England. The ambulance strike affects non-life threatening calls only and people are advised to continue to dial 999 in an emergency. Unions want above-inflation pay rises, but in the case of ambulance workers and physiotherapists have not specified a figure. The RCN is calling for a 19% pay rise. The government has said the demands are unaffordable, and pay rises were decided by independent pay review bodies. While the NHS budget has traditionally risen by an average of 4% above inflation each year, since 2010, the average annual rate of increase has been half that. The government has pointed to extra funding for the NHS and social care, including up to £8bn announced in the Autumn Statement. Further strikes are planned by ambulance workers on 17 February and next month. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Digital cameras back in fashion after online revival,"Digital cameras from the early 2000s are becoming must-have gadgets for many young people because of a burgeoning trend online. Search traffic for old kit on online marketplaces like eBay and Etsy is on the rise. And in the past 12 months, videos with the hashtag #digitalcamera have amassed more than 220 million views on TikTok. Analysts describe the trend as being linked to similar revivals of turn of the century fashion. Scott Ewart, 32, who lives on the Isle of Arran, has clocked up more than five million likes on his TikTok account, using what is now considered retro kit. He said: ""A lot of folk find them quite comforting. It reminds them of their childhood, it reminds them of simpler times. ""I find it quite refreshing going back to something so simple. With older cameras you have to work with them a bit more, to get a good photo or to get the most out of them. ""Because with every smartphone you buy, you can't take a bad shot almost."" Scott started by digging out old cameras belonging to his parents, but has quickly expanded his collection to more than 30 pieces of kit. He added: ""I get folk asking me, 'where do you edit these photos, are they edited?'. And I always say these are never edited and I want to show exactly how they've come out on every camera."" EBay UK told the BBC the last three months of 2022 saw increases in people seeking the devices. This included a 13% rise in search traffic for ""vintage digital camera"", and a 52% rise for ""refurbished camera"". Etsy, which focuses on handmade and vintage items, has also seen a growing interest from shoppers in the last six months. It currently has more than 19,000 items linked to digital cameras listed online. Katie Glasgow, 25, lives in Brooklyn, New York and calls herself ""the oldest possible Gen Z"". She has also been using her parents' old kit to make images and video. ""It looks like memories, because it's blurry and imperfect. It looks more like how we remember things,"" she said. For younger people, who will have virtually no recollection of these cameras in their 2000s heyday, this opens up a kind of ""nostalgic world"", she said. ""These are the cameras my older sister took to prom or my brother had in college, or my young childhood memories were recorded on. ""With your phone you can take videos and pictures of literally everything. So your library is huge, versus with this you kind of have to decide, 'this is a moment I actually want to preserve'. Paul Greenwood, head of research and insight at the creative agency We Are Social, said it was a ""natural cycle"" where when people hit their 20s ""they become nostalgic for the cultural touchstones of their youth"". He added: ""They want to feel comforted when in the real world they feel uncomfortable. And there's some reasons why people are feeling uncomfortable - like the existential dread you're seeing with Ukraine, the pandemic, wealth inequality. ""It's seen as more real and authentic. And that's why we're seeing this trend really play out, because the grainy kind of content you see is basically shorthand for authenticity and realness. That's what Gen Z are looking for.""

Has the Brexit fishing promise come true?,"Even though fishing is a tiny part of the UK economy, it was a key issue in the Brexit campaign with promises to ""take back control"" of British waters.  At the end of 2020, Boris Johnson announced his new Brexit trade agreement with the EU, promising that ""[we will] be able to catch and eat quite prodigious quantities of extra fish"".  The UK-EU fishing rules, which came into force at the start of 2021, mean: There was give and take because UK boats still needed to sell their fish to EU markets.  The UK now negotiates annually with non-EU fishing nations such as Norway and the Faroe Islands. Before Brexit, it was covered by the EU's negotiations with them.  Government figures show the amount of fish UK boats caught and landed in the UK (and at ports in Europe) has been rising: Mark Spencer, the fisheries minister told MPs in December 2022: ""We are 30,000 tonnes better off now that we are outside the EU"". Dr Bryce Stewart, a fisheries biologist from the University of York, believes the government has overstated the longer term impact.  He says most of the benefit came in 2021, because 15% of the EU's quota was transferred then, with much smaller transfers to come up to 2026. He also points out: ""Quotas are not always fished to their full extent. Fish are unpredictable, they might not always be where you think they are, the weather might be too bad to fish and markets might not be available."" In 2019, the top UK port for the amount of fish landed was Peterhead in north-east Scotland, with 132,000 tonnes, followed by Lerwick, on the Shetland Islands, with 28,000 tonnes.  They accounted for more than a quarter of all landings by UK boats.  In 2021, Peterhead and Lerwick got more than 83% of the extra catch - 25,000 of those 30,000 extra tonnes. Ports in north-east England - Hull, Grimsby and Bridlington - as well as in the south-west - Plymouth and Newlyn - all saw decreases on their 2019 catches.  Why did some areas do better and some worse? Dr Stewart says the new quota system is skewed towards a small number of species, benefiting those places where they're fished. ""The gains to the UK in terms of tonnage and value are highly concentrated. Western mackerel, which is fished off the north coast of the UK and landed in places like Peterhead, accounts for about 30% of the change in overall value."" The Scottish Pelagic Fishermen's Association (SPFA) represents 22 boats which fish for mackerel and herring in the north-east Atlantic. ""If you asked me if our fishermen would prefer to be back in the EU, the answer would be a huge 'absolutely not',"" said chairman Ian Gatt.  It's a different story for Jane Sandell of UK Fisheries, a foreign-owned company based in Hull. Its trawlers fish in Norwegian waters in the North Atlantic and 95% of their catch is cod which goes to UK fish and chip shops. Ms Sandell says before Brexit (when the UK share of the fish in Norwegian waters was determined by EU-Norway negotiations), the company would catch about 15,000 tonnes of cod a year and employed 106 crew, most from the north-east of England.  In 2022, their catch halved. She blames the fishing deal the UK negotiated with Norway in 2021. Announcing it, the government said UK boats would ""gain access to 30,000 tonnes of white fish"" in 2022 - the limit for cod was set at 7,000 tonnes a year.  Ms Sandell says: ""From the middle of 2021 to the end of 2022, I had to make 72 fisherman jobless. That's the worst bit, because it's people's livelihoods.""  Gary Taylor, a former government fisheries negotiator, says: ""The position - when the UK was part of the EU - was that we were very much a net beneficiary of the deal with Norway.  ""We gained significant amounts of Arctic cod. That was drastically reduced under the current [UK-Norway] deal."" One of the main requests from the fishing industry in Cornwall was to exclude French and other EU boats from the zone between six and 12 miles off the Cornish coast.  The Brexit deal did not do this - which was ""extremely painful"", according to Chris Ranford from the Cornish Fish Producers Organisation which represents about 170 vessels fishing for over 40 different species of fish. ""Our boats are often affected by the weather and the sea conditions. They are not able to go to the sea at certain times of the year because they don't have engine capacity or the size of the boat to do so. During those times, we get a lot of foreign vessels operating up to the six mile line."" He's also sceptical about the post-Brexit increase in fish quotas.  ""Us in the south-west of England, fishing relatively close to the shore, haven't seen anywhere near as much as a 25% increase. We are looking at very minimal numbers."" In Devon, Juliette Hatchman of South Western Fish Producers highlighted post-Brexit trade.  Although the trade deal avoided tariffs (taxes) on UK seafood exports to the EU, she says there are still problems:   ""The sheer cost of all the additional export paperwork is quite eyewatering. Whilst the extra costs have in part been absorbed into the selling prices to some EU customers, this has clearly resulted in the loss of some long-standing smaller EU (namely French) customers.""

China balloon: Could it have been blown off course as Beijing claims?,"The Chinese authorities say a surveillance balloon sighted over sensitive US territory is theirs, but insist its purpose is for weather research and that it was blown off course by unexpected winds.   We've looked at the prevailing wind patterns and data modelling to track its possible path. It was monitored travelling across Canadian territory before appearing over the city of Billings in Montana on Wednesday, where it was spotted in the sky by city residents. US authorities say they've been tracking the balloon across US airspace using manned aircraft, and that it's been flying over sensitive military areas. China says strong ""westerlies"" blew the device ""with limited self-steering capability"" off its planned course. BBC Weather's Simon King says that in the north Pacific between China and North America, the prevailing winds are westerlies (that is, from west towards the east). ""In recent days, the wind speeds above an altitude of 30,000 to 40,000ft (9,000 to 12,000m) were 150mph (240km/h) or above in this area of the Pacific,"" he says. ""There is nothing unusual about wind speeds this high in this area.""  The wind patterns in the north Pacific in the past few days would have blown the balloon north-east to Alaska and then south-east through Canada to Montana, he says.  ""Most weather balloons rise to about 100,000ft and then blow apart after a few hours, with the equipment falling to Earth by parachute. It is unusual for a weather balloon to last days like this.""   Dr Marina Miron, researcher in defence studies at Kings College London says the balloon might have been more sophisticated than China claims. ""The balloon could be controlled remotely by an operator on the ground,"" she says. ""They'd be able to raise or lower the altitude of the balloon so that it could pick up different wind currents which are going in different directions.  ""You would want to be able to make it linger over a spot to collect data. This is something you can do with balloon which you cannot do with a satellite.""    Not with any certainty. We don't have flight tracking data that we would for commercial airliner, for example, so we need to look to other sources of information. One technique used to estimate the path of high-altitude particles or objects is to use a model based on wind speeds and direction.   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric US department (NOAA) has developed such a model (known as HYSPLIT) based on winds at altitudes over 14,000m (46,000ft).   ""Its primary use,"" says Simon King from BBC Weather, ""is for working out the transport and dispersion of things such as pollutants and hazardous material in the atmosphere.   ""The model also works backwards - called back trajectory - where we can see where anything carried in the air such as pollutants, ash or other material has come from. ""In the case of the balloon over the US, this back trajectory can show where the air carrying the balloon originated from and by analysing wind direction and speed, where it'll go in the future."" US meteorologist Dan Satterfield has used this model to calculate a possible route the surveillance balloon has taken, and has shared his findings online.   Starting from the position sighted in Montana on 1 February, he has estimated a possible back trajectory for the balloon, based on wind data, originating in central China. It must be stressed that this is not the actual path the surveillance balloon has taken, but an analysis based on the model developed by NOAA, a US government agency.

Dramatic rescue saves Thai baby who fell down well,"A baby girl has been rescued by authorities after she fell down a deep well in southern Thailand.  The 19-month-old child fell down the 13m (42ft) deep shaft while playing on Monday afternoon in Tak province, near the Myanmar border.  Authorities launched an overnight rescue operation after the girl's parents - who had been working in a nearby field - raised the alarm.  She was taken to hospital and treated for minor injuries, officials said.  ""She has signs of fatigue but still has good vital signs,"" local police chief Ratsaran Ketsoising told AFP. Panic was sparked after the baby girl - who is said to be the daughter of two Myanmarese migrants - fell through a 30cm (12in) wide gap at the top of the well.  The baby's parents said they had taken her to work with them at a tapioca farm in the Khiri Rat sub-district. They said they had left her under a tree while they worked.  But they raised the alarm after they were unable to find the child during their break and heard cries coming from the nearby well.  Rescue teams were forced to work through the night using a mechanical digger, with which they dug a 10m deep pit adjacent to the well shaft.  Oxygen was pumped into the well to allow the child to breathe. Images at the scene showed rescue workers in hard hats working at the bottom of a deep pit. But authorities told local media that they feared that the well could collapse in on itself and harm the child if they continued to use the digger, so they used hand-held shovels to remove the final few metres of earth.  PBS Thailand reported that rescue workers reached the child at about 08:00 local time (01:00 GMT), but were unable to pull her out immediately, as she appeared to have suffered an injury to her leg.  However, cheers erupted shortly afterwards from the assembled rescue workers after the girl was finally pulled from the well.  ""We are so glad we could rescue him safely,"" recue worker Chanachart Wancharernrung told reporters. ""We have been trying since yesterday afternoon. We worked without sleep. Everyone helped out.""

South Korea stalker jailed 40 years for killing woman in subway,"A man in South Korea has been sentenced to 40 years in jail for killing a female colleague who had reported him for stalking and harassment. The case sparked an outcry and calls for legal reform in South Korea, after police failed to act adequately on the victim's repeated complaints. Jeon Joo-hwan, 31, was convicted of stabbing the woman to death in a subway restroom in central Seoul last year. A Seoul court on Tuesday said it had been a ""revenge killing"". Jeon, a subway worker, had become obsessed with his 28-year-old female co-worker, stalking and threatening her over two years, the court heard. He called his colleague more than 300 times, begging her to date him and threatening to harm her if she refused. Despite a police investigation and a request to the courts for him to be detained, he was never imprisoned or given a restraining order. Authorities viewed him as ""low-risk"". He was eventually charged and convicted of stalking. On 14 September, the day before he was due in court to be sentenced on those offences, he tracked down the woman at her work shift in a central Seoul subway station and murdered her in the public bathroom. ""From the defendant's testimony, it appeared he was determined to murder the victim unless she agreed to settle,"" the Seoul District Central Court said in its verdict, according to Yonhap news agency. The court heard that Jeon believed the woman owed him damages as he had lost his subway job after she reported him to authorities. The court on Wednesday also ruled against the prosecutor's demands for a death penalty for Jeon, stating that his young age meant he could still reflect on his crimes and atone for them. In the aftermath of the murder, there were calls to strengthen South Korea's stalking law, which carries a clause stating that perpetrators can only be prosecuted with the consent of victims. Critics argued this made it too easy for victims to be bullied into withdrawing their cases. South Korea's justice ministry has agreed to remove the clause, but the bill is yet to pass parliament. A fortnight ago, lawyers representing victims of domestic abuse and sexual violence called on lawmakers to pass the bill urgently. They cited the case of another woman who had been recently stabbed by her stalker. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64552871
Turkey and Syria earthquake: ‘It was like a doomsday scenario',"When the earthquake struck in the middle of the night, it was an especially terrifying moment for Ismael Alraj. He had just stepped outside the hospital in al-Dana, in north-western Syria, where had taken his sick son, Mustafa, when everything started to violently shake. Mustafa was still inside the building, getting treatment. ""Then the earthquake got stronger,"" Ismael tells me over a patchy phone connection. ""The power went out and the entrance to the hospital, which was made from glass, started shattering."" Ismael, a journalist, saw two residential buildings collapse about 150m (500ft) away and was totally disorientated in the sudden darkness. ""It was like a doomsday scenario,"" he says. ""I started imagining how I would have to rescue my son from the rubble.""  A minute later, he saw his Mustafa running towards him, screaming and crying. He had ripped out his own drip, and blood was oozing from his arm. For up to an hour, nobody could reach the collapsed buildings. They could not call the civil defence units either because of power and internet cuts.  Al-Dana is an opposition-held town in Idlib province, near the border with Turkey. Civil defence units are the only emergency first responders in the absence of any government services, but the scale of the devastation made it impossible for them to reach everyone affected. A few hours after the 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck, Ismael went to assess the situation across Idlib.  ""The damage is indescribable,"" he says. ""The areas most affected are ones which were previously bombarded by Syrian government or Russian forces."" The Syrian uprising in 2011 descended into a bitter civil war in which the Syrian regime, backed by Russia, pounded rebel-held areas.  For the past three years there has been a shaky ceasefire in north-western Syria. The region is split into a patchwork of zones controlled either by Syrian opposition forces or the Damascus-based government. Ismael saw dozens of residential buildings destroyed in the town of Atareb, north of the government-controlled city of Aleppo. ""There are many buildings and neighbourhoods which rescue teams can't reach because of a shortage of equipment,"" he says. ""We really need help from international organisations."" Doctor Osama Salloum works for the Syrian American Medical Society (Sams), which supports a number of hospitals across the opposition-held north-west.  ""I was in the Sams hospital in Atareb a few hours after the quake,"" he says. ""When I left the hospital there were around 53 deaths. I could not count the number of injured.""  He says more than 120 people have now died in that hospital alone.  Dr Salloum says the hospitals have little resources to cope with such a disaster. ""Most of the people saved from the rubble have deep injuries which need specialised treatment and advanced equipment,"" he says, adding that Atareb's hospital only has one old computerised tomography (CT) scanner. Most aid comes in via Turkey and is subject to strict checks at the border. With Turkey facing a huge humanitarian crisis itself, it is unclear what supplies will reach the opposition-held areas in Syria. ""If we run out of our current medical supplies, we will suffer,"" says Dr Salloum. The earthquake also hit areas under government control in the north. Aya was on a visit to her family in the coastal city of Latakia when it struck. The 26-year-old chef was asleep with her mother and three siblings when the power went out. ""I got out of bed but was not sure what woke me up,"" she tells me. ""I didn't understand what was happening until I found the rest of my family also up."" Her family home is on a main road and has glass windows throughout.  ""We couldn't move because of how strong the quake was,"" she says. ""We remained rooted on the spot."" Aya's mother has Parkinson's disease. She was petrified and panicking.  ""I was in shock and couldn't move,"" says Aya. ""I kept looking at how the walls were shaking and moving back and forth. I can't describe to you how crazy the situation was."" Haneen, a 26-year-old architect, also lives in Latakia. She tells me young men in her neighbourhood put up tents for people to shelter from the rain.  The tents are normally used to host mourners during a funeral. It's a sombre thought for Haneen.  Her mother was in her home village and is safe, but Haneen is traumatised. ""I'm not sure if I helped my sister or myself leave the house first and I can't face asking her,"" she says. They sheltered in front of their local bakery before returning home. Things were more difficult for Aya, as she could not find a taxi or any shelter for her sisters and mother during a storm in the middle of the night.  Aya and her family eventually managed to get to Damascus, but she is not sure she can face returning to the house in Latakia.  ""We witnessed the war and were forced out of our house in 2012,"" she says. ""The feeling I had in the middle of the earthquake was very different to what I felt during the war.  ""I felt that at that moment everything around me could collapse. I could lose my mother or my sister. It was a very heavy and difficult feeling."" Even reaching the safety of Damascus could not fully help.  Aya felt dizzy for hours, as if the earthquake was still going on. ""It was like a wound re-opening. A large wound that was healing slowly but has re-opened again,"" she says, reflecting on more than a decade of civil war. ""The wound was re-opened for everyone in Syria without exception."" For Dr Salloum, the earthquake also brought him back to the worst days of the war, living under bombardment in then-opposition-held eastern Aleppo before it was captured by government forces in 2016. ""I felt death was close,"" he says. ""I kept hearing buildings and rocks fall."" He describes the chaos of those first few moments of the earthquake, hearing people panic and cry for help.  ""I could not understand what was happening,"" he says. ""It's been a tough day and there is no end in sight."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-64538295

Ireland country profile,"Ireland emerged from the conflict that marked its birth as an independent state to become one of Europe's economic success stories in the final decade of the 20th Century. After the country joined the European Community in 1973, it was transformed from a largely agricultural society into a modern, high-technology economy. However, the economy collapsed following the 2008 global financial crisis. With the help of an international bailout, Ireland has been recovering once more. Its strong literary and musical traditions, as well as its long history of emigration, have given Ireland an international cultural presence disproportionate to its size. In 1921 the British government split the island into the mainly Protestant North and the mainly Catholic South, planning to keep both regions in the United Kingdom. However, the South seceded in 1922, while Northern Ireland opted to remain.  Northern Ireland subsequently saw decades of violent conflict between those campaigning for a united Ireland, and those wishing to stay in the United Kingdom, until a communal power-sharing agreement came into force in 1999. President: Michael D Higgins Michael D Higgins, a veteran left-wing politician, poet and human rights activist was elected president in 2011. He ran for a second term as president of Ireland in 2018 and was re-elected in a landslide victory He is a former Galway university lecturer and published poet who has dedicated his four-decade political career to championing Irish culture and left-wing causes worldwide. He is an Irish speaker. The president wields little power beyond the ability to refer potentially unconstitutional legislation to the Supreme Court, but has an important symbolic role in representing Ireland at the national and international level. Prime minister (Taoiseach): Leo Varadkar Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar became head of the coalition government in December 2022. Previously, the Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin had been the coalition's prime minister, adn the two swapped roles of prime minister and deputy prime minister. The coalition between traditional rivals Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, plus the Green Party, formed in June 2020, after closely-fought elections in February had put the resurgent left-wing Sinn Féin party in second place. This is the first time the two main parties have served together in government. The economic impact of the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union, and the maintenance of the Good Friday peace accord in Northern Ireland have been key considerations for the government. Public Raidio Teilifis Eireann (RTE) provides TV, radio and online services in English and Irish and is the main player in the broadcasting sector. Media outlets operate freely, although Reporters Without Borders has raised concerns about the impact of highly-concentrated media ownership. Some key dates in modern Ireland's history: 1801 - Kingdom of Ireland annexed to Great Britain under the Act of Union.  1840s - Great potato famine: Ireland's staple crop fails, starving a million people to death and forcing millions more to flee abroad.  1914 - Outbreak of World War One delays implementation of new home rule legislation which would have restored the Dublin parliament following centuries of unrest over British dominion in Ireland. 1916 - Nationalists stage Easter Rising, seizing the General Post Office in Dublin and proclaiming an independent Irish republic.

Vanuatu country profile,"Vanuatu - a string of more than 80 islands once known as the New Hebrides - achieved independence from France and Britain in 1980.  Most of the islands are inhabited; some have active volcanoes. Vanuatu is mountainous and much of it is covered with tropical rainforests. Like most of the area, it is prone to earthquakes and tidal waves. In 2015 it was hit by Cyclone Pam which caused widespread damage. Most of the people live in rural areas and practise subsistence agriculture. Local traditions are strong. Women, for example, generally have lower social standing than men and have fewer educational opportunities. The island of Pentecost is home to land diving, a precursor to bungee jumping, which is still practised. President: Nikenike Vurobaravu Nikenike Vurobaravu was elected president in July 2022. He succeeded Tallis Obed Moses.

The practice, known as ""blackbirding"", continues until the early 20th Century.  1906 - Britain and France make the country a Condominium, under joint administration. 1938 - Emergence of the John Frum (also John Brum or Prum) cargo cult. Believers say goods owned by American and European visitors to the island are really meant for them but are intercepted by the foreigners. They believe that their ancestors will one day return with ""cargo"" for them. The British outlaw any mention of John Frum. 1956 - John Frum is recognised as a religion by the Anglo-French Condominium. 1963 - The NaGriamel political movement emerges on Espiritu Santo. Followers advocate the return of land to the ni-Vanuatu people and a return to traditional ways.  1971 - NaGriamel, anxious that more than 36% of the New Hebrides is now owned by foreign missionaries, planters and traders, petitions the UN to prevent further land sales to non-indigenous people  1977 - Representatives of the New Hebrides and the governments of Britain and France agree an independence plan for the islands in 1980 following a referendum and elections.  1978 - A measure of self-government introduced.  1980 - Jimmy Stevens, the leader of NaGriamel, declares Espiritu Santo independent of the rest of the New Hebrides renaming it the Independent State of Vemarana.

Disney removes Simpsons 'forced labour' episode in Hong Kong,"Disney has removed an episode of The Simpsons referring to Chinese labour camps from its streaming service in Hong Kong. The absence of the One Angry Lisa episode in its latest season was flagged in media reports this week. It is unclear when it was removed. Disney has declined to reply to the BBC's queries.  There have been rising concerns about censorship in Hong Kong after it passed several controversial laws. The city had previously had access to more civil freedoms than the Chinese mainland, but Beijing has clamped down on these rights since major pro-democracy protests rocked the city in 2019. In the episode, which first aired last October, the character Marge Simpson is shown images of the Great Wall of China during an exercise class.  During the class, her instructor comments: ""Behold the wonders of China: Bitcoin mines, forced labour camps where children make smartphones."" The BBC has reported that hundreds of thousands of ethnic minority people in the western region of Xinjiang have been forced into manual labour.  The Chinese government denies this and says the factories are part of a voluntary ""poverty alleviation"" scheme. The Simpsons has been shown on and off in mainland China since the early 2000s. Clips from the current season can be found on Chinese streaming sites, but not of that particular scene, according to a BBC check on Tuesday. The removal of the latest Simpsons episode comes after Disney in 2021 also removed a show episode referring to the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. Censorship of Western TV is commonplace in mainland China, and critics say this pattern has been increasing in Hong Kong. Hollywood studios have previously been accused of removing potentially objectionable content to Chinese censors in order to retain access to the large Chinese market.  In 2020, Hong Kong passed a wide-ranging national security law which criminalises acts of subversion, or undermining the power or authority of the central government. Authorities say it is necessary to maintain order, but opponents say it has been used to silence critics and democracy activists. On Monday, the trial for Hong Kong's largest national security case began with 47 people accused of ""subversion"". In 2021, the city's legislature passed a film censorship law aimed at content deemed to ""endorse, support, glorify, encourage and incite activities that might endanger national security"".  Officials said at the time that the law did not apply to streaming services. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64550177
Belfast war memorial protest inquiry 'closed too soon by PSNI',"The police investigation into a ""protect our monuments"" protest in Belfast was closed prematurely, the Police Ombudsman has concluded. Several hundred people took part in the demonstration outside City Hall in June 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic. Organisers said it was set up to defend war memorials. The ombudsman Marie Anderson said the senior officer who led the inquiry ""did not carry out a thorough and careful investigation"". She recommended disciplinary proceedings but they could not be progressed because the officer retired from the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Bobby Singleton said the protest had happened at a time when legislation on gatherings during the pandemic was ""rapidly changing"". Mrs Anderson concluded there was a failure to exploit intelligence which may have led to the identification of the protest organisers. She said there was an error in submitting a request for intelligence and a ""lack of follow-up"" when no response was received. She added: ""In conducting an investigation a police officer is required to pursue all reasonable lines of inquiry and it is evident it did not occur in this instance. ""Viable lines of inquiry existed if the available intelligence had been accessed and in my view the senior investigating officer did not carry out a thorough and careful investigation."" Mrs Anderson stated that the investigation was in contrast to the prompt identification by police of people involved in Black Lives Matter protests in Belfast and Londonderry earlier in the same month. The anti-racism protests were sparked by the death of George Floyd in the US. A number of people were referred for prosecution and police had issued a ""significant number"" of fines. The ""lack of consistency"" was likely to ""compound damage to confidence in policing"" within ethnic minority communities, said Mrs Anderson. At the time of the monuments demonstration the police said they had encouraged people to comply with health regulations in place. The PSNI confirmed that no arrests had been made or fines issued. However it stated that a ""substantial"" evidence gathering operation had been in place. Mr Singleton said the PSNI accepted the ombudsman's recommendations and training for officers on a ""human rights-based approach"" to policing protests had been since been implemented. He said a key objective for the police at the time of the protest was to slow the spread of the Covid-19 to keep people safe. ""Balancing this against our obligation to safeguard other important rights - such as the right to peacefully protest - was not easy,"" he said. ""We have previously accepted that as a service we didn't always get that balance right."" He said the PSNI was determined to improve relationships with all communities in Northern Ireland.

Rail disruption ahead as Preston station closes for revamp,"Rail passengers are being warned of four weekends of disruption as a railway station is set to close for essential works. No trains will run through Preston Railway Station from 18 February as part of a £1.5m upgrade at the Lancashire station, Network Rail said. Passengers are being urged to plan their journeys in advance. Network Rail said the maintenance work was ""crucial"" and will lead to ""more reliable journeys"". The work will see upgrades to the railway foundation stone and six switches and crossings, with sections of track moved to allow trains to change lines. Network Rail route director Phil James said: ""Upgrading complex equipment like switches and crossings means we have no choice but to close sections of railway and stop trains running so engineers can quickly and safely carry out our work."" He said the improvements would mean ""better, smoother and more reliable journeys for passengers and freight on the West Coast main line"". The railway will close completely between Wigan North Western and Lancaster on 18-19 February, 25-26 February, 4-5 March and 12 March. Passengers have been urged to plan ahead and should be prepared for some of their journeys to be made by bus. A rail replacement bus service is set to run between Wigan North Western, Preston and Lancaster. Services from Manchester and Liverpool to Scotland will also be affected. Where the line is open, passengers are advised fewer trains will be running, services are expected to be busy and journeys will take longer than usual.

Household rates rise in two more Northern Ireland councils,"Two more of Northern Ireland's 11 councils have agreed rates increases for the 2023-24 financial year. Mid Ulster District Council agreed to increase household rates by 7.3% while Newry, Mourne and Down District Council agreed a rise of 5.99%. Last week Belfast City Council agreed to increase household rates by 7.99%. The money generated by rates is used to pay for public services, with bills decided against the value of a property. Newry, Mourne and Down District Council chairman Michael Savage said the change - agreed on Monday night - reflected the ""difficult situation"" the authority was facing. Energy bills and increased staff wages were contributing factors, he added. ""Overall we are facing increased costs of £11m in the coming financial year,"" he said. Mr Savage said all 11 councils in Northern Ireland were facing similar economic challenges. Setting a rate took months and the initial rate under consideration had been more than halved, he explained. The meeting on Monday night was delayed as legal advice was presented by a senior official ""urging extreme caution"" on the use of reserve money held by the council to reduce the rates increase. Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) councillor Gareth Sharvin questioned the council chief executive Marie Ward about that in light of the cost-of-living crisis. ""This council now has a surplus totalling £35m. We are supposed to have a sufficient surplus - an excessive one is not needed,"" said Mr Sharvin. ""Can we not use our reserves to offset costs and strike a rate of 3.49%?"" Ms Ward said all council capital projects were under review as the reserves were ""already being used and being significantly reduced"". Sinn Féin councillor Barra O'Muiri said the rise of 5.99% was ""the lowest rate that we can safely go down to"". ""It would be impossible to go down any further without jeopardising our future capital programme,"" he said. ""When we had the dispute over employee wages, we were able to deal with it swiftly and avoided any strikes and that was due to our reserves. ""The rate of 5.99% is one of the lowest of all councils."" A vote on the rate was carried by a majority, with the Democratic Unionist Part (DUP) and SDLP both abstaining. The Mid Ulster District Council rate rise of 7.3% was agreed at a council meeting on Monday evening. DUP councillor Paul McLean said his party made a counter proposal of 4.9% but Sinn Féin proposed 7.3% which was seconded by the SDLP. ""We proposed savings of £1.8m which equated to bringing the rates [rise] down to 4.9%,"" he said. ""I know what it means to a household - 7.3% against 4.9%. ""It might not seem a lot in the eyes of people but for families that are struggling and households that are struggling finding that extra £20 or £30 or £40 per year is a big ask."" Domestic rates are made up of a regional rate - usually set by the Northern Ireland Assembly - and a district rate set by Northern Ireland's councils. In the absence of a sitting assembly at Stormont, the UK government's Northern Ireland Office will set the regional rate. BBC News NI understands that a regional rate increase will be struck ahead of bills being sent out in April. The regional rate covers services such as hospitals and roads maintenance, while the district rate covers services such as leisure centre facilities and waste management. Other councils are expected to announce their 2023-24 rates in the coming weeks. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64544699

NHS Strikes: Unite ambulance staff on second day of strike,"Unite ambulance staff have begun their second day of strike action. As members of the union began striking yesterday in Wales, talk of a deal was described as ""wholly premature"". But ambulance bosses have warned the service still faces ""significant pressure"" and have drafted in military personnel to drive ambulances. The Welsh government said it would continue talks with Unite, who have further strikes planned for 20, 21 and 22 February. Other health unions are set to ballot on a new pay offer from the Welsh government. Eluned Morgan, Wales' Health Minister, said: ""We're really pleased that all of the other unions have suspended their action.  ""Obviously they now need to put that to their members and we really hope that they will take the opportunity to pick up this additional funding that has been really difficult for us to find.  ""If they don't, its going to be made clear that there isn't anything else, there's no more money that we can find."" Adam Morgan is the senior negotiator at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy in Wales, which postponed strike action planned for Tuesday.  He told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast on Tuesday: ""We appreciate the difficult position the Welsh government are in with their budget.  ""Unfortunately this doesn't go as far as we would like, however we think that in good faith from the negotiations we should pause it, to go to our members. ""We understand that there is no more negotiation on the amount of money available, especially for this year. We will be putting it to the members to decide whether they accept it and then its up to them to make their voice clear."" Mr Morgan said his union will be meeting the Welsh government on Tuesday for further talks with a view of consulting its members ""in the next week or two"".

Article: published on 7 February 2023,"A mural of a seagull painted by Banksy as part of the artist's Great British Spraycation has been covered up. The gull mural on the side of a house in Lowestoft, Suffolk appeared in August 2021.It was painted next to a skip, which formed part of the artwork, but it was recently removed to deter fly-tipping.East Suffolk Council said the building was privately owned but it was understood renovation works were taking place which was why scaffolding and a screen were covering the mural. The mural, painted on the house on the corner of Denmark Road and Katwijk Way, was one of three painted in Lowestoft as part of the street artist's Great British Spraycation collection across Norfolk and Suffolk.It was originally painted next to a skip containing strips of insulation to represent chips.The council said in January the skip was removed after it had been used ""as a place to dump rubbish of any kind"".It said the building's owner took the decision to remove the container. Martin Halliday from Lowestoft can see the mural from his place of work.He believed it was being removed. ""Definitely. They've gone to a lot of trouble to shroud the whole building in scaffolding,"" he said.""The top of the gable end has been taken away as has the chimney stack.""We would assume if they were going to remove the Banksy mural in one go, like they did on the other one [on London Road North], they would literally just have to board the wall and make it safe either side and then they could crane it out. ""It does look like it's going to be flying to a new home very soon."" The council previously said the artist's visit in the summer of 2021 had a ""hugely positive cultural and economic effect in East Suffolk"".Many of the surviving pieces have been protected by UV-stabilised polycarbonate screens to prevent them fading with exposure.

"Harry Styles' Grammys routine went in wrong direction, dancers reveal","Two of Harry Styles' dancers have said they had to quickly adapt their Grammy Awards routine after the stage started spinning in the wrong direction. The ex-One Direction star performed his single As It Was at Sunday's ceremony, where he won album of the year. The British singer and his dancers performed on a giant turntable, and rehearsed with it revolving one way. But on the night, it started spinning the opposite way, ""freaking us all out on live television"", one dancer said. ""The moment the curtain opened and it was time to perform, our turntable started spinning in reverse, backward,"" explained dancer Brandon Mathis. ""There was nothing we could do to stop it. So after a week of rehearsing this piece perfectly going one way, the moment it's time to perform, it starts going the other way, and in real time we have to troubleshoot and do a complete piece in reverse. ""Talk about professionalism,"" he added in his explanation on his Instagram story, which is no longer available. His account was echoed by another back-up dancer, Dexter Da Rocha, in a since-deleted TikTok post. ""We rehearsed for 10 days getting down these beautiful formations and sliding off the turntable... and Harry did such a good job integrating into it,"" Da Rocha explained. ""This whole time we're practicing with the turntable counter-clockwise. We did it loads of times and got it down to the point where we were at dress rehearsal, it was spotless and beautiful."" But when the turntable started turning the wrong way on the night, Da Rocha said the dancers tried to ""get the attention of the technician"", but it was live TV and they ""couldn't yell"" so the technician didn't hear them. ""So, to switch all those patterns on the spot, having not even walked in that direction... like it sounds it'd be easy to walk, it's like a treadmill, but I swear to god, since it's circular, it pulls you in different directions and it's such a special type of balance."" Da Rocha praised Styles, saying he ""did his best to be able to walk and reverse everything while he was singing and reverse his entire duet, which was incredible"". The Recording Academy, the organisation behind the Grammys, has not yet responded to the BBC's request for comment. Styles won two of the six Grammys he was nominated for on Sunday - best pop vocal album and album of the year for Harry's House.  Album of the year is widely seen as the night's top prize, and Styles held off competition from artists including Adele, Lizzo, Coldplay and Beyoncé, who had widely been seen as the frontrunner. Accepting the award, Styles said: ""I've been so inspired by every artist in this category with me. ""But it's important for us to remember that there's no such thing as the best in music. This doesn't happen very often to people like me so this is very nice, thank you."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-64552569
NHS strike dates: Why are nurses and ambulance staff taking industrial action?,"Nurses, ambulance staff and physiotherapists are striking over pay. Nurses Royal College of Nursing (RCN) members in England are striking on 6 and 7 February.  The RCN says these are the biggest nursing strikes so far, affecting more than a third of NHS trusts in England and all but one Welsh health board. The union has about 300,000 members - roughly two-thirds of NHS nurses. The RCN and GMB unions in Scotland put strike action on hold to allow talks on the 2023 pay offer.  Ambulance staff  Unite members are striking on the following dates:  GMB members in the South West, South East Coast, North West, South Central, North East, East Midlands and Yorkshire are striking on 20 February, and 6 and 20 March.  GMB ambulance staff in Wales called off their 6 February strike after an improved pay offer.  Unison members in London, Yorkshire, the South West, North East and North West are striking on 10 February. Physiotherapists Up to 4,200 members of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) are striking at 33 health trusts across England on 9 February.  The union represents three-quarters of the 30,000 physios and support staff in the NHS in England. Staff across all health boards in Wales are striking on 7 February. CSP members in Scotland accepted an improved pay offer, but the union warned further strikes in England and Wales are likely.  Midwives Members of the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) in Wales are striking on 7 February. Nurses Life-preserving treatment must be provided. All nurses in intensive and emergency care should work.  Anyone who is seriously ill or injured should still call 999, or 111 for non-urgent care. Most of the 73 NHS trusts involved in the February strikes are hospitals. Services such as chemotherapy, kidney dialysis and intensive care will be staffed, as part of emergency cover. The biggest disruption is likely to be in pre-booked treatment such as hernia repair, hip replacements or outpatient clinics. Ambulance staff The advice remains to call 999 in an emergency. Those who fall, or suffer other non-life-threatening injuries are unlikely to receive 999 care.  Physiotherapists Emergency care will be available. Staff will advise hospital inpatients about any impact. Outpatients should attend appointments as planned, unless they have been asked to reschedule.  Midwives The RCM says the action will not affect services for women in labour or emergency care. The RCN wants a 19% pay rise, although it has indicated it may meet the government ""halfway"".   Unions representing ambulance workers and physiotherapists also want above-inflation pay rises, but have not specified a figure.  The government says the demands are unaffordable, and that pay rises are decided by independent pay review bodies. Fourteen health unions, representing more than a million NHS workers in England, said they would no longer work with the NHS Pay Review Body regarding the 2023-24 pay deal. MPs on the House of Commons' Health and Social Care Committee were told the Department of Health and Social Care missed the deadline for submitting evidence about the next pay deal. The Treasury has submitted evidence. The average salary for ambulance staff in England were £46,643 for April 2021 to March 2022, according to NHS Digital. Of this, £13,854 came from extra payments for things like shift work and overtime. Workers classed as support staff - such as ambulance technicians and non-emergency ambulance drivers - received £29,139 on average, of which £7,842 came from extra payments. The starting salary for a nurse is England is just over £27,000 a year. This is the bottom of pay band five of the NHS contract, known as Agenda for Change. Staff such as healthcare assistants, porters and cleaners are on lower pay bands. Workers are entitled to in-the-job increases within their pay band. A nurse with four years' experience could expect to earn close to £33,000 - the top end of pay band five.  The most senior nurse consultants can earn up to nearly £55,000.  NHS physios are on the standard NHS contract that applies to all staff bar doctors and dentists. Starting salaries for physios are just above £27,000 in England. The most experienced physios can earn more than twice that in the NHS, although many combine NHS commitments with private work. The British Medical Association (BMA) opened a strike ballot for junior doctors on 9 January, which runs until 20 February.  The BMA says staff will walk out for 72 hours in March if the ballot is successful.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-63561305
Vanuatu country profile,"Vanuatu - a string of more than 80 islands once known as the New Hebrides - achieved independence from France and Britain in 1980.  Most of the islands are inhabited; some have active volcanoes. Vanuatu is mountainous and much of it is covered with tropical rainforests. Like most of the area, it is prone to earthquakes and tidal waves. In 2015 it was hit by Cyclone Pam which caused widespread damage. Most of the people live in rural areas and practise subsistence agriculture. Local traditions are strong. Women, for example, generally have lower social standing than men and have fewer educational opportunities. The island of Pentecost is home to land diving, a precursor to bungee jumping, which is still practised. President: Nikenike Vurobaravu Nikenike Vurobaravu was elected president in July 2022. He succeeded Tallis Obed Moses. He is a career diplomat and politician who has served in numerous diplomatic and government positions, including as the Vanuatu's first resident high commissioner to Fiji. The presidency is considered to be a mainly ceremonial post.   Prime Minister: Ishmael Kalsakau Ishmael Kalsakau was appointed prime minister in November 2022 following a general elections in October 2022 after a no-confidence vote against the then-prime minister Bob Loughman.  The single TV channel on Vanuatu was established with the help of Radio France Overseas (RFO) and broadcasts in French and English.

Success for Swindon graffiti artist with face blindness,"Imagine the inability to visualise a sandy beach, a stunning sunset or even the person that you love. This is the reality for street artist, Sarah Harris aka ""Lost Dogs"", from Swindon.  Ms Harris was diagnosed with aphantasia or ""face blindness"", as she refers to it, in her fifties. Scientists describe aphantasia as people being unable to conjure up images inside their head - known as their mind's eye. Having picked up a spray can for the first time during lockdown, Ms Harris was recently asked to paint the cover of a global graffiti graphic novel - something she says happened as a result of her aphantasia. She was taking part in an underground group of artists when she says she was asked to paint a page of the graphic novel in black and white. Ms Harris resisted because her work is known for its colour; being colour blind as well, she often puts colours next to each other that really stand out and are bright. She said the page she was originally given to paint ""had the same character repeated, I said because of my face blindness when I paint the same face four times it looks like four different people, so maybe you don't want me to do that"". Listen to Ms Harris tell BBC Radio Wiltshire about the novel and aphantasia She said she was messaged back and told: ""'If colour is your thing, why don't you do the front cover instead?' ""I was really chuffed that because of my disadvantages I ended up getting bumped up to the cover,"" she says. Published by indie comics title Markosia, Ms Harris and another artist, KJ Stilwell, from Southend, collaborated with graffiti artists from eight other countries including Indonesia, Turkey and India. Ms Harris said: ""It's even more fun when something's global. All different cultures are involved even though they're drawing a story based in London. They're bringing their own local art styles, which is exciting."" People followed the comic story on sites like Facebook and would need to wait until an artist painted a page in street graffiti somewhere in the world to know what happened next in the story. Ms Harris has looked back at how school was tough for her and hopes being labelled will not put off those with face blindness from becoming the next generation of artists. ""Teachers used to say to me, 'we don't understand Sarah, your still life's are fantastic but anything else, it's like you're not trying', they thought I wasn't putting the effort in but I really was. ""Now I look back and it's really obvious I could do still life because there was a bowl of fruit right in front of me so I could copy it, I could draw it pretty much spot on. They never put two and two together so I just got told off a lot for not putting the effort in."" If a young person with aphantasia is considering taking up art, Ms Harris says, ""go for it and don't worry you've probably got a classmate who can draw perfect faces with no reference at all"". ""Don't think 'oh they're a proper artist and I'm not' because proper art is a huge range and there are loads of artists with aphantasia, and I can look at their work and see that it's similar to mine. ""Other than not being very good at recognising people in the street, aphantasia hasn't really disadvantaged me to any extent at all."" Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Ukraine war: Russians seen reinforcing east ahead of offensive,"Tens of thousands of Russians are being sent to eastern Ukraine as part of an offensive planned after 15 February, according to the Ukrainian governor of Luhansk region. ""We are seeing more and more reserves being deployed in our direction,"" said Serhiy Haidai, who expected a three-pronged Russian advance. Ukraine has warned repeatedly of an imminent offensive. But there is widespread scepticism of significant Russian success. The UK's defence intelligence briefing said Russia's aim was almost certainly to capture parts of Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region that were not already under occupation. But the UK said ""it remains unlikely that Russia can build up the forces needed to substantially affect the outcome of the war within the coming weeks"". Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said seven Ukrainians towns had been ""liberated"" in recent weeks and operations were progressing ""with success"" in two more, Bakhmut and Vuhledar. For six months, Russian mercenaries -now joined by regular troops - have tried to capture Bakhmut, a small city with a pre-war population of 70,000.  Now a Ukrainian commander, Denis Yaroslavskiy, has said only 2,000 civilians remain and Russian forces have captured parts of the east and north of the city and continue to move forward. The head of Russia's Wagner mercenary force said this week that Ukrainian forces were not in retreat anywhere in the city and fierce battles were taking place for every street, house and stairwell. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the military was paying close attention to Russia's attempt to encircle Bakhmut. ""We are countering them,"" he said on Monday night. He announced that leaders with military experience were being appointed in border and front-line regions, who could ""prove themselves"" against current threats from Russia. Ukrainian forces said on Tuesday they had shot down a Russian combat aircraft over Bakhmut, but there was no independent confirmation.  Russian forces have made little progress in Ukraine since their retreat from the major southern city of Kherson last November. Last month they captured the town of Soledar north of Bakhmut after an intense battle. Almost a year into Russia's invasion, an estimated 300,000 Russian reserve troops have been recruited in recent months in an attempt to break through Ukraine's front lines in the east. Capturing Bakhmut could enable Russian forces to press on towards the bigger cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk. Mr Haidai said the Russians' two-month training period was coming to an end and Moscow would need around 10 days to transfer them to the front for a new offensive. He suggested that in Luhansk region they would target three towns: Bilohorivka, Kreminna and Svatove. President Zelensky has appealed to Western countries to hurry sending heavy weaponry to Ukraine to help Ukraine repel Russia's expected offensive. The US agreed last week to send long-range missiles that will enable Ukraine to double its attack range. The Russian defence minister warned that Western heavy weapons were drawing Nato countries into the conflict and ""could lead to an unpredictable level of its escalation"".

Funding on offer to pay for homes for refugees in Scarborough,"Scarborough could be getting nine houses to provide rental homes for Ukrainian and Afghan refugees. A grant of £744,000 has been offered to the council by central government. If the council agrees to take the funding it will be match-funded by local social housing providers to buy the properties, which will later be used for other families when the refugees return home. The seaside town is home to 60 Ukrainian and 28 Afghan families. According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, a council report said the arrival of people fleeing the two countries had ""unavoidably created additional demand for housing at a time when local authorities are already under strain"". Last year the authority announced its Better Homes Joint Venture plan which aims to address the lack of affordable housing in the borough by creating more than 700 new homes over an initial 10-year period. Scarborough Council said that while the amount of notice given regarding the £744,000 was ""very challenging"", the funding was nevertheless welcome. It said: ""Homes shall both help mitigate some of the pressure on sponsors, refugees and the council, and shall provide a lasting legacy within the social housing stock."" The authority has said average grant levels are likely to be in the region of £93,000 per property while the total value of the match funding needed was about £1.16m. The report states the homes should be acquired and ready by November 2023. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Send your story ideas to yorkslincs.news@bbc.co.uk.

Final call for under 50s Covid vaccines on Isle of Man,"Isle of Man adults under the age of 50 who are not vulnerable will no longer be able to receive Covid jabs from 24 February. After that date vaccines will not be offered to those aged 16-49 unless they are in an at-risk group, Manx Care said. The island is sticking to advice from the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Medical director Sreeman Andole said the island had high levels of immunity. Dr Andole said vaccine uptake among the young had been low and priority was shifting towards protecting older and more vulnerable groups. The autumn booster programme for those aged over 50 and other vulnerable adults would also draw to a close on the same date, Manx Care said. A spokeswoman said plans to continue offering vaccines to at-risk groups in the future were being developed. Those who have yet to receive a booster as part of the autumn programme have been urged to book an appointment before it shuts. Dr Andole said the changes would be reviewed regularly.

Turkey earthquake: Communities work together to donate aid,"Communities have been pulling together to organise aid for victims of the ""devastating"" Turkey-Syria earthquake. People across west England have set up collections for food, warm clothing and put out a call for volunteers to help with on-the-ground efforts. Collection points at the Wiltshire Turkish Community Centre have been filling up fast and families in Bristol have been contacting relatives. Bath rescuer Rob Davis said the impact had been like 2010's Haiti earthquake. ""Heavy reinforced concrete buildings have been destroyed across the area,"" Mr Davis, a Search And Rescue Resistance In Disaster (SARAID) worker, said. ""The added complication is that it happened when people were in bed so their reaction time was much slower.  ""It's devastating. It's our job now to go and locate those people who are trapped."" Mehmet Guvercin, chair of Turkish Wiltshire Community (TWC), said: ""Most of the Turkish and Kurdish community here have friends or family who have been directly affected. ""A couple of friends of mine have been confirmed dead, another friend of mine lost his wife, mother and two sisters. ""Over the next few days we will know more on what has happened to other people."" Tugba Aliya Altun, also of TWC, said: ""We have packed everything from baby food, to nappies and adults' clothing, everything. ""I'm feeling wrecked but this is easing my pain just a little because I know I'm helping."" Henry Aslan, from Bristol, said that when he heard news of the quake he immediately called his family, who live in northern Istanbul. ""They didn't feel anything but the east side is terrible,"" he said. ""To the people who have lost their families, I'm so sorry. ""My brother is in Turkey and he has got trucks. This morning I told him, fill up your truck, get food and drive it to the east side."" International operations manager for Wiltshire-based charity Re:Act Disaster Response, Paul Taylor said his teams were set to arrive in Turkey on Wednesday morning. ""The first thing that we can do is ascertain the needs of the affected population,"" he said. ""It is likely to be in these early stages, medical support, water and critically because of the temperatures, shelter. ""People are scared. Psychologically it can be very demanding. ""The first phase is a search and rescue phase. On the back of that, they will then address humanitarian needs."" Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Uruguay country profile,"Uruguay has traditionally been more affluent than other countries in South America, and is known for its advanced education and social security systems and liberal social laws. It was the first nation in Latin America to establish a welfare state, maintained through relatively high taxes on industry, and developed a democratic tradition that earned it the sobriquet ""the Switzerland of South America"". But economic and political turmoil, in particular left-wing urban guerrilla attacks in the early 1970s, led the government of the day to suspend the constitution and launch a period of repressive military rule that lasted until 1985. Since the restoration of democratic government, successive governments have liberalised the economy. Colonial towns, beach resorts and a year-round mild climate have contributed to a growing tourist industry. President: Luis Lacalle Pou Mr Lacalle Pou of the conservative National Party won the 2019 presidential election, ending 14 years of left-wing rule. Voters named the economy and crime as major concerns, and Mr Lacalle Pou campaigned on fiscal responsibility and plans to put more police on the streets.

Six-year-old who shot his teacher allegedly assaulted another,"A six-year-old child who shot a teacher at a Virginia school allegedly once choked another teacher ""until she couldn't breathe"", according to a legal notice filed by the injured teacher. The child's alleged past behavioural issues surfaced in a notice to claim letter sent by her lawyer. Abby Zwerner, 25, intends to sue the Newport News school district for alleged negligence. She is recovering after being shot at Richneck Elementary on 6 January.  The notice of claim was obtained by the Associated Press news agency through a public records request.  It outlines allegations of previous behavioural issues the child is said to have had at school, including cursing at staff and teachers, trying to whip students with his belt and choking a teacher.  The week of the shooting, the boy allegedly ""slammed"" Ms Zwerner's phone and broke it, according to the claim notice.  He was given a one-day suspension and shot Ms Zwerner in her classroom the day he returned to school. Police have described the shooting at ""intentional"".  Lawyers for Ms Zwerner have previously said that school leaders were warned three times that the boy might have a gun on the day of the shooting.  The boy's backpack was searched, but no gun was found. No further action was taken. ""It is a miracle that more people were not harmed,"" lawyer Diane Toscano, wrote in the notice.  ""The shooter spent his entire recess with a gun in his pocket, a gun that was loaded and ready to fire ... while lots of first-grade students played."" In a public statement last month, the child's family said the boy had an ""acute disability"". They said the boy took part in a care plan at the school related to his disability, which usually involved one of his parents attending school with him every day. He was unaccompanied for the first time the week of the shooting.  The school's superintendent lost his job amid the fallout from the incident and the assistant principal resigned.  The teacher involved in the alleged choking described in the claim confirmed the incident to the Associated Press but asked not to be named. She said in 2021, the boy came up behind her, locked his forearms around her neck and pulled her backwards.  She said she informed school administrators of the incident but did not receive the type of response she had hoped for. The boy was later moved to another school.

Bolivia country profile,"A country of extremes, landlocked Bolivia is the highest and most isolated country in South America. It has the largest proportion of indigenous people, who make up around two-thirds of the population. The country has the second-largest reserves of natural gas in South America, but there have been long-running tensions over the exploitation and export of the resource. Indigenous groups say the country should not relinquish control of the reserves, which they see as Bolivia's sole remaining natural resource. Bolivia is also one of the world's largest producers of coca, the raw material for cocaine. A crop-eradication programme, though easing the flow of conditional US aid, has incensed many of Bolivia's poorest farmers for whom coca is often the only source of income. President: Luis Arce Luis Arce won the October 2020 presidential election, returning the Mas socialist party to power after a 12-month interregnum. Opposition senator Jeanine Áñez declared herself interim president in November 2019 after President Evo Morales resigned in the tumultuous wake of a disputed election. His bid to win another term in office had led to street protests, and he resigned after the armed forces withdrew their support. Mr Morales, the first president to come from the Bolivia's indigenous majority, carried out a radical programme after winning power in 2005, aimed at addressing extreme social divisions and inequalities. Ms Áñez withdrew from the October 2020 presidential election, and President Arce, a colleague of Evo Morales, has pledged to form a government of national unity. Bolivia's media landscape is dominated by private newspapers and broadcasters With hundreds of stations, radio is important, especially in rural areas.

Pervez Musharraf: Thousands attend funeral of ex-Pakistan military leader,"Thousands have attended funeral prayers for Pakistan's divisive former president General Pervez Musharraf.  The ex-military ruler, who was president from 2001-2008, died in Dubai on Sunday after a long illness, and his body was repatriated to Pakistan. The prayers took place at a military compound in Karachi, but senior figures were notably absent, including the army chief and Pakistan's current president. He was a key US ally during its ""war on terror"" but had a complicated legacy. An estimated 10,000 people attended the prayers, mainly retired and serving military officers, AFP news agency reported.   Neither the army chief, prime minister or president were there, but local media reported that some politicians and former army chiefs attended. Musharraf's body was later transported to a nearby military graveyard where the coffin, draped in the national flag, was buried as hundreds of people watched surrounded by tight security. In a statement, Pakistan's powerful military expressed its ""heartfelt condolences"", while President Arif Alvi prayed ""for eternal rest of the departed soul"". General Musharraf was born in Delhi in August 1943, but his family joined millions of other Muslims in the newly created Pakistan, following the partition of India in 1947 after British rule ended.  He entered the Pakistan Military Academy in 1962, serving in the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965, and throughout his career had a ""love-hate"" relationship with neighbouring India.  As the head of the armed forces, General Musharraf seized power in a bloodless coup in October 1999, before formally appointing himself as president two years later.  As Pakistan's leader at the time of the United States' ""war on terror"" in the wake of the 11 September terror attacks in 2001, Musharraf controversially supported the American-led military campaign to oust the Taliban regime in neighbouring Afghanistan, who had harboured Muslim radicals blamed for the attacks. In January 2002, he issued a strong condemnation of extremism, pledging to fight Islamist terrorism in Pakistan.  This pro-Western agenda angered many militants at home, and there were several assassination attempts made against him.  In 2008 he suffered defeat in the polls and left the country six months later. He was embroiled in a number of court cases following his loss of power, including accusations of failing to provide adequate security for former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, whose assassination by the Taliban in 2007 sent shockwaves around the world. Musharraf's career ultimately ended in disgrace, when he was sentenced to death in absentia for treason in 2019. Though that sentencing was later reversed, he never returned to Pakistan. An editorial in Dawn, Pakistan's largest English-language daily, said Musharraf leaves behind ""a mixed legacy"", and that while he navigated some difficult times around the events of 9/11, his actions also ""set Pakistan back several years"".  ""It should be left to history to judge him,"" it said.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64555401

Kuwait country profile,"Oil-rich Kuwait is a tiny country nestling at the top of the Gulf. Flanked by powerful neighbours Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran, its strategic location and massive oil reserves make it one of the world's richest countries per capita.  A conservative state with a Sunni Muslim majority and a US ally, Kuwait stands out from the other Gulf monarchies for having the most open political system.  But tensions have persisted between parliament and the cabinet, controlled by the ruling Al-Sabah family, and the government is facing increasing calls for radical political reform from the opposition.  Emir: Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah Sheikh Nawaf took over on the death of his half-brother Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Jaber al-Sabah in September 2020. Sheikh Sabah reigned from 2006, having previously served as a highly influential foreign minister for 40 years. He maintained Kuwait's pro-Western stance and pursued a policy of cautious reform, which Sheikh Nawaf, aged 83 when he ascended the throne, is expected to continue.

Turkey earthquake: The survivors' choice - danger inside or freezing outside,"At dawn in the biting cold we made our way to a 10-storey building in Adana that had completely collapsed. I met two women wrapped in blankets, heading towards the rubble.  Ummu Bayraktar and Nazife Batmaz are staying in a mosque in the Turkish city, which has become a hub for the relief operation after Monday's earthquake.  Their own home nearby was badly damaged. We walk and talk as they head to find their friend, one of Ummu's cousins.  A companion urges us not to walk close to another building. It's cracked, he says: ""They'll all have to come down.""  We pass two diggers working on the edge of the collapse zone, while six rescue workers use drills and gloved hands to throw down rubble towards them.  We then take a side street, where I see a group of survivors wrapped in blankets sitting on plastic chairs keeping warm around a fire.  The two women seek out their friend, Nurten, coddled in a blanket in the freezing cold. She sits and weeps.  Her adult daughter, Senay, was on the second floor of the collapsed building. Nurten has been waiting here all day and all night, but no news has come.  ""When my daughter is lying in the cold, how can I lie down in a warm bed?"" she asks. ""My daughter never liked the cold, oh God. She is under the earth. My heart is burning,"" she cries.  We hear the drills and the crump of the digger. Nurten's friends comfort her. Her daughter has two girls of her own - both currently studying abroad. They're trying to head back to Turkey.  ""What am I going to tell the girls? They're coming here today. What am I supposed to tell them? They had entrusted their mother to me,"" Nurten says.  The sense of loss is spreading more quickly than the search for survivors.  Further south, on the Turkish border with Syria, more news came in overnight from Hatay province, one of the worst hit regions.  In the darkness, footage showed a resident searching in the rubble. He believes someone is alive underneath. ""Speak out loud,"" he pleads. ""As you see, there is a dead body here. He is dead and nobody has removed him. And a woman's voice is heard from underneath."" As he speaks a woman's voice cries out from the rubble. She cries again, and then bangs on metal trying to hold the man's attention. But there is nothing he alone can do. An entire home is collapsed and it will take machinery to lift the ruins.  This is a story of unanswered cries, being repeated over and over again across this region.  Nearby, another Hatay resident, Deniz, points to the collapsed building where his parents were stranded. ""They're making noises but nobody is coming. We're devastated. My God... They're calling out. They're saying, 'Save us,' but we can't save them. How are we going to save them?"" he asks.  Even closer to the epicentre, in the city Kahramanmaras, fire crackles. There, thousands of buildings are reported collapsed, the number of homeless even higher.  A family gathers, too frightened from aftershocks to go back to their badly hit building. The firewood is all they have. Flames bring a little warmth to bare hands.  ""We barely escaped from inside the house,"" says Neset Guler.  ""We have four children. We left the house with them at the last moment. There are several people trapped inside. It is a huge disaster. Now, we are waiting without water or food, we are in a desperate state."" A region awaits help it may be impossible to provide on the scale needed. And in the meantime, more buildings risk falling, and the small fires outdoors will be the only way to stay warm.

The shocking details about how a morbidly obese teenager, weighing almost 23st (146 kg), was treated by those who were supposed to care for her and the grim circumstances of her death have made international headlines. Kaylea's dad Alun, a father of six, has been convicted of gross negligence manslaughter - a charge her carer mum had already admitted. Emergency services told jurors about how they felt ""physically sick"" as maggots were found feeding on her body as she lay in soiled clothing and bed linen in her fly-infested, dirty and cluttered room. The courtroom heard she had been restricted to her bed for more than six months - since the start of the UK's Covid lockdown - when she died at her mid Wales home in October 2020. But beyond headlines of the ""squalid"" and ""inhumane"" conditions in which a bed-ridden Kaylea lived and tragically died, there was a ""lovely and pleasant"" young woman, who had recently celebrated her 16th birthday, seemingly with her whole life ahead of her. Not long before that, Kaylea was a ""quiet yet cheeky"" girl who showed ""impressive potential"" on the wheelchair basketball court of her hometown of Newtown in Powys. ""She was a wonderful person and used to try card games - and she could cheat better than me in the end,"" joked her old coach Steve Cox. ""She was quietly playful. Board games like Jenga too - and there was pool, she'd cheat at pool too! ""I'd take a shot, I'd turn my back and when I look around, there'd be a couple of balls missing and she'd give me this sly grin! ""She was very pleasant, a joy to work with. It was a shame we couldn't have worked with her a bit more.  ""She was quite impressive. We would have liked to get her higher up the disability sport ladder for, I'd say, we could have got her into the Paralympics at a push."" Steve isn't the only one to recall Kaylea's strong will, as her former learning support assistant testified at her father's manslaughter trial that she was ""fiercely independent"". Belinda Jones, who first began helping Kaylea at Newtown High School in 2016, told Mold Crown Court she was initially very independent and could push herself around in her chair. Kaylea went to Steve's training sessions between the ages of 10 and 12 and said he and others in the wheelchair basketball circles thought she was a possible ""star of the future"". ""The early stages of wheelchair basketball is really difficult, but Kaylea certainly took to it like a duck to water,"" recalled Steve. ""I saw the potential for scoring a basket and the competition between me and her. I couldn't win - she was always so determined as well as being friendly and sociable. ""She also knew that I'm not very technical, so took great pleasure in teaching me how to use a mobile phone as anybody who is my age will realise it's a challenge. She treated me like a caveman basically."" After leaving wheelchair basketball, Kaylea and Steve crossed paths again when he was involved in the local youth club she went to as a 14-year-old. ""By then, she was a little bit quieter and withdrawn compared to the girl I was used to who would take great pleasure in putting me down and having fun,"" he recalled. ""I remember the cheeky smile, the wind-up part of Kaylea as well as her determination and inner strength."" So hearing the appalling nature of what subsequently happened to one of his former pupils - and one that he remembered so fondly - was tough for Steve to hear. ""Personally I find it hard to read about it,"" he said.  ""Especially because it's somebody you know. ""The first thing you do is think could we have done more? But after a time you think, I did everything I could.  ""I can't get my head around it - and in small places like Newtown, a youngster passing away hits the entire town. I don't even think it's totally sunk in with people yet."" Kaylea's 40-year-old mum Sarah Jane Lloyd-Jones, a mother of six, had previously admitted manslaughter by gross negligence and now Kaylea's dad Alun Titford, 45, has been convicted too - and both await sentencing. His trial had heard Kaylea's mum dealt with welfare calls from her school, especially during the 2020 Covid lockdown, and one Newtown High call log entry said ""mum struggling to support Kaylea at home while juggling work as a carer"". Titford was asked in court what he had done to help his partner care for their disabled child, and he said ""nothing"", admitting it was ""possible"" things would have been different if he had helped.  However, he denied causing Kaylea's death, despite revealing to jurors he's ""as much to blame for Kaylea's death as Lloyd-Jones"". The removal worker accepted he could have been a better father but said ""I got lazy, tired after work"" and would do ""nothing"" at home and just watched television at night in his bedroom. Titford's defence barrister claimed in court Kaylea was ""let down"" by health and social services. David Elias said she was discharged from physiotherapy in 2017 in the same year a social worker agreed with Lloyd-Jones that there was no role for the children-with-disabilities team. The following year, Mr Elias told Mold Crown Court Kaylea was discharged from a dietetics service because Lloyd-Jones did not make a new appointment. The question authorities will now attempt to get to the bottom of is whether they could have done more to help and prevent Kaylea's death. Wales' former children's commissioner Sally Holland has said the ""appalling circumstances"" in which Kaylea died makes this one of the ""most horrifying cases"" she had come across in more than 25 years in children's services. A child practice review, which is a multi-agency safeguarding study, is already underway. This will investigate if any child protection lessons should be learned - and what effect lockdown had on Kaylea's care. ""The review will look at were there missed opportunities to speak to Kaylea directly,"" said Prof Holland. ""We know there's a risk when children are not seen and spoken to directly. We've seen countless cases over the decades where children have not been seen and we've later found out that they were in a desperate state of being abused or neglected."" Social work consultant Delyth Lloyd Griffiths said Kaylea's school was ""good"" at logging conversations with her mum. She added that the practice review will look into whether the authorities could have done more to help a family that had told the school they were struggling. ""In terms of social services, were they involved?"" she asked.  ""Were there referrals made? Were they giving the family services prior to lockdown? That's what the review will answer."" Child protection expert David Niven, however, thinks that while Kaylea was neglected, the tragedy could be ""far more sad than bad"". ""The parents sounded a bit overwhelmed and incapable of understanding that level of knowing what to do,"" he said. ""Or if, as they say, Kaylea was a very headstrong girl, then standing up to her and insisting they care for her no matter what, because that was their parental responsibility. ""It is possible she slipped through the social services net in lockdown, but also maybe she was unavoidably missed because she wasn't considered to be at risk and the household wasn't considered to be a dangerous place. ""When you compound that with lockdown, a 15 to 20% social worker vacancy rate, and that the most urgent cases had to be seen by remaining staff, then it's not surprising that if these were the issues, that Kaylea may have been bypassed."" Powys council has said it will not comment until the practice review has been completed.

Belfast court: Diary of mum who stabbed her children read to jury,"A woman who stabbed her two children and herself wrote in her diary that she did so because she wanted her partner to be ""happy with another woman"" a court has heard. She is charged with murdering her eight-week-old son and attempting to murder his two-year-old sister in July 2021. The woman cannot be named to protect the identity of her daughter. She accepts she stabbed the children but denies the charges. On Tuesday extracts from a diary found at her home were read at Belfast Crown Court. In the black book, she wrote: ""I chose to take our lives for everything you've done to us. ""You got to the point of leaving your children for another woman. ""All you wanted was to have arguments so you have reasons to leave and be with your woman. ""I hope you will be happy next to her. ""I couldn't bear the thought that you are with her and you did not care about us any more. ""I chose to take our lives so nobody would mock us any more. ""Even if we will be up there we will love you and wait for you to be a happy family again. ""Please don't forget about us. Bring us flowers and light us candles at the cemetery. ""We will be happy again when we meet in the next life. ""In real life we couldn't live without you and we weren't a family without you. ""God, what I've become to take my life and the children so you can be happy."" The woman then asks not to be separated from her children and asks that her partner is buried beside them. The jury was also shown footage from a camera worn by a police officer who was called to the woman's home three days before the stabbings. Asked why she called the police, the woman says: ""Because it is too dangerous."" She alleges that her partner pushed her at the top of the stairs and says that the back of her head hit a wall. She tells the officer that she and her partner argued about getting passports for their children. She says: ""I don't feel safe with my kids here beside him. ""He give me too much stress. All the time shouting, drugs and alcohol. I have enough, you know what I mean?"" Visibly distressed in the footage, she is seen feeding her baby a bottle of milk. Footage was also shown of the woman being checked in to a police custody room. She is heard telling an officer: ""I killed my children. This is the truth."" When asked about her mental health, the woman says: ""Depression I have 100%. I had it and still have it. ""I have cried too much and I'm really sorry for what I've done. ""If I could turn back time."" The woman is then heard asking about the condition of her daughter. The trial continues. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64557693
"Northern Ireland Protocol: Don't expect perfect fix, says Major","There should be no expectation that the Northern Ireland Protocol negotiations will lead to a ""perfect"" solution, a former prime minister has warned. Sir John was prime minister and Conservative Party leader from 1990 until 1997. He was also involved in key talks that helped pave the way for the signing of the Good Friday peace agreement. ""Nobody can expect to get all of what they're asking for in a negotiation,"" said Sir John. He has previously called the negotiations that led to the Northern Ireland Protocol as ""one of the least well done"" processes in modern history. Sir John appeared before Westminster's Northern Ireland Affairs Committee on Tuesday. He told MPs that there were ""deficiencies"" in the protocol that needed to be addressed and that he was hopeful of a joint solution between the UK and EU. But he warned: ""To reach an accommodation requires unionists and nationalists to be prepared to get a great deal of what they're asking for but not all of it. ""We need them to accept that any agreement may not be perfect - you have to find somewhere in the middle where everyone accedes to something they don't wholly like."" The protocol is a part of the UK-EU Brexit deal that keeps Northern Ireland aligned with some EU trade rules. It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, avoiding the need for a hard border with the Irish Republic after Brexit. However it also creates a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, something the EU accepts is causing difficulties for many businesses. Some unionists say it is also undermining Northern Ireland's place in the UK. In protest against the protocol, Paul Givan of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) resigned as Northern Ireland's first minister in February 2022, collapsing the power-sharing agreement. Since then there has been no devolved government in Northern Ireland. Talks between London and Brussels have been intensifying in a bid to reach agreement but as yet there has been no breakthrough.

Cost of living: Big banks' bosses defend savings rates and branch closures,"Savers have access to a host of competitive savings deals, bank bosses have argued, as they faced criticism over poor rates of interest. The chief executives of four of the biggest banks in the UK were hauled before MPs who questioned the generosity of their savings rates. The UK chief executives of Lloyds, NatWest, HSBC and Barclays said deals had improved as savers shopped around. They also said branch closures were a response to consumers' changing habits. The Bank of England's benchmark interest rate was at historically low levels for a decade until December 2021, since when it has risen consistently. It is now at 4%, having risen from 0.1%. MPs on the Treasury Committee said their constituents complained that mortgage rates rose more rapidly than the returns offered to savers when the base rate went up. Described as the highest-paid panel which had sat before the committee for some time - collectively earning more than £10m a year - the quartet of bank bosses argued that this debate incorrectly centred on the interest rate offered on instant-access savings accounts, which typically have a return of less than 1%. They argued that regular saver deals offered market-leading rates of interest, and that instant-access products were often a ""gateway"" to higher interest deals. Matt Hammerstein, from Barclays, Charlie Nunn, from Lloyds Banking Group, Ian Stuart, from HSBC, and Dame Alison Rose, from NatWest, argued that they were also encouraging customers to begin a savings habit. ""Only one in four people have £100 of savings in their account,"" said Dame Alison. ""There is a real concern about financial confidence in young people. We have targeted savings for young people's accounts as well."" Savings levels built considerably during the pandemic, as consumers' ability to spend was curtailed. The soaring cost of living has since dampened some of this saving.  However, the bank bosses argued that many people were actively searching for better deals as interest rates rose. Mr Nunn said price comparison websites had become highly developed in this area. While some were shopping around, millions were still low on confidence in making good financial decisions, and so needed good guidance. Many households are also facing the prospect of having to pay more on their mortgage repayments in the coming year. Mr Stuart pointed to a new fixed-rate deal, launched by HSBC on the same day as the hearing, which was the first five-year deal with an interest rate of less than 4% since early October. He argued that this showed that mortgage rates were falling, despite the Bank rate still rising, and was far lower than the rates that had been predicted after the mini-budget. Yet, he said that the ""headwinds are ahead of us, not behind us"" when analysing the number of people who were falling behind on mortgage repayments. The bank chief executives were also pressed on branch closures, with all accepting they had shut a host of premises in recent years. Mr Stuart said that this was a response to the changing ways people were managing their money. ""Customer behaviours started to change in 1982 with the advent of the cash machine, and it has been on a journey from that point and it has sped up,"" he said. He said that 98% of transactions in December were digital, displaying how the needs of customers from a branch had changed in recent decades. The bosses gave examples of cash pods, bank hubs, mobile banking vans, and smart ATMs as alternatives, with specialists often using different channels to talk to customers in their own homes.

Pat Ward: Trial begins of woman accused of murder,"A woman has gone on trial accused of murdering a man in County Tyrone four years ago. Karen McDonald, 37, who lived in McCrea Park in Clogher, is accused of the murder of 30-year-old Pat Ward. The father-of-four, who was originally from Sligo in the Republic of Ireland, was found in an alleyway on 9 February 2019. The jury was told Ms McDonald's former partner Niall Cox, 27, has pleaded guilty to the murder. A prosecution lawyer described the timeline of events which were captured on CCTV and will be shown to the jury. Mr Ward bought alcohol in an off-licence with Ms McDonald and Mr Cox before returning to the couple's home in McCrea Park. A camera on a neighbour's property recorded his wife Ellen Ward arriving at 04:45, looking for her husband. She was allegedly verbally abused by Ms McDonald, who claimed he had left in a taxi to Enniskillen in County Fermanagh. Two hours later the camera recorded two people moving Mr Ward's body out of the house. While Mr Cox was dragging the body, the prosecution alleges that Ms McDonald was holding Mr Ward's legs for a few seconds before dropping them. ""We say that for a short distance that's her aiding, abetting and supporting Mr Cox in removing him from the house,"" said the lawyer. The trial will hear evidence from a pathologist that Mr Ward was still alive as he was dragged by Mr Cox into the alleyway. Pat Ward had suffered a brain haemorrhage after being hit forcefully by a wooden or metal object. He also had knife wounds. The pathologist will tell the jury that the head injuries meant he would only have survived for about half an hour. Police were called after Mr Ward's partially-clothed body was discovered by a couple walking to work. Other items of his clothing, including his top and trainers, were discovered in a field behind the couple's house. Inside the house police found a machete, a barbell weight and a pick axe. The lawyer told the jury: ""We can't say exactly what happened [in the house] that Saturday morning. ""The only person who can say what happened is the accused Ms McDonald."" The trial at Dungannon Crown Court continues. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64557692
Warning hundreds of England bus services face cuts,"Hundreds of bus services across England could be cut if government funding is not extended, the industry has warned. Up to 15% of services could be scrapped, according to the Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents bus and coach firms. With government funding and the temporary £2 fare cap set to expire at the end of March, the industry is calling for a long term support plan. The Department for Transport has refused to comment on the issue. Buses are the most popular form of public transport in England. The government has provided £2bn to support bus firms during the pandemic when passenger numbers fell, but this help runs out at the end of next month. Passenger numbers have not returned to those seen before the pandemic. That, alongside rising fuel prices and driver shortages, are putting an increasing strain on commercial bus services. Even with the additional support over a thousand routes across England were lost last year. ""Sustained investment in maintaining bus services will unlock huge economic, health and environmental returns for the taxpayer and leverage further private sector investment in new technologies such as zero emission vehicles."" said Graham Vidler, chief executive of the Confederation of Passenger Transport (CPT). Labour has warned the government has ""ten days to act"" as operators need to give six weeks notice to register any changes or cuts to bus routes. Its analysis of the CPT's figures shows that if not, England could be left with fewer than 10,000 routes for the first time since records began.  The Shadow Transport Secretary Louse Haigh MP said ""the future of services millions of passengers depend on"" was at risk. A Conservative Party spokeswoman said its funding had already helped to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and maintain services. The Urban Transport group, a network of city transport authorities, says no long term funding plan makes ""a mockery"" of the £2 fare cap scheme ""if the very services the scheme was designed to promote were then scrapped"".

Ministers' constituencies targeted in escalation of Scottish school strikes,"Scotland's largest teachers' union will target the constituencies of the first minister and her deputy in an escalation of strike action.  It could lead to six further days of strike action in the Glasgow Southside constituency of Nicola Sturgeon and John Swinney's Perthshire North patch.  The EIS will also target the Dunfermline constituency of Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville. Teachers want a 10% pay increase which ministers say is unaffordable. Ms Somerville has said teachers should suspend their strike action while pay talks continue, and called for more ""compromise"" as the exam season looms.  A national teachers' strike is already scheduled to take place on 28 February and 1 March.  There are also plans for 20 days of rolling strikes across all local authority areas from 13 March until 21 April.  Announcing a further escalation of industrial action in February and March, the EIS said it would target the constituencies of:  The union said it would target Scottish Greens education spokesperson Ross Greer, MSP for West Scotland, with action in East Dunbartonshire. EIS members will be called out in four of the five areas on three days from 22 to 24 February. This will not include Ms Hagman's ward as it is a planned holiday period. All five areas will then be targeted for a further three days of action from 7 March. The union said precise details of the schools involved would be published shortly. EIS members have already taken part in three days of national strike action and 16 days of rolling action across the country.  General secretary Andrea Bradley said it has been a year since the teachers' pay claim was submitted.  They have rejected the current 5% offer, which includes rises of up to 6.85% for the lowest-paid staff.  Ms Bradley accused the Scottish government and Cosla of having ""dithered, delayed and dragged their feet while the cost of living has continued to soar"". ""The latest offer, for a well below inflation 5%, has now been kicking around for six months and has been rejected by Scotland's teachers twice,"" she added.  ""Our members have already taken part in three days of national strike action, and a further 16-days of rolling action across the country.  ""The response from the Scottish government and Cosla has been, essentially, nil - and this now has forced an escalation in our action."" Ms Somerville told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show at the weekend that Cosla and the unions ""remain some way apart"" on pay negotiations.  She said she had asked unions to suspend industrial action while talks were continuing, but they had refused. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-64555500
Royal Holloway University to build new drone testing hangar,"A new drone research and testing hangar is to be built in Surrey. Plans for the 895 sq-m site at Royal Holloway University have been approved by Runnymede Borough Council. The facility, which would be 13.5high, will allow operators to develop and test specialist electric drones in a ""confined, safe space, without disrupting residents or those on campus"", the university said. It will be a ""showcase facility"" for the university, planning documents say. The application has called for the exterior of the hangar to be a mix of white and grey to ensure it retains a ""subtle appearance"". The Egham-based university says the site will enable flight training to assist with drone and robotic educational research trials. It said the facility would be part of a new Omnidrome Research and Innovation Centre at the university. No drones will be permitted to fly outside of the building. The prefabricated hangar is expected to take approximately three weeks to build, with work expected to begin in spring this year. Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

Turkey-Syria earthquake: People rally to help survivors,"Communities from across the south of England are rallying together to offer help to those affected by the earthquake in Turkey and Syria.  More than 5,000 people have been killed in the 7.8 magnitude quake that hit both countries on Monday.  Donations and help are being sent by groups in Dorset and Berkshire.  Nine firefighters from the Hampshire & Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Service have also been deployed to Turkey.  A collection is under way at Meyrick Park Cafe in Bournemouth.  Residents have been asked to donate blankets, food, sanitary products and clothes for people of all ages. All items will be collected by 15:00 GMT on Tuesday before being transported to Turkey on a cargo flight.  Elsewhere in Dorset, Sherborne Abbey Primary School will run a non-uniform day on Friday, asking each child to donate 50p. The funds raised will be sent to the Red Cross to support those affected by the earthquake. International NGO Khalsa Aid, which has an office in Slough, Berkshire, has confirmed it will be dispatching a team from the UK and one from Iraq to help provide food and water.

Single-use plastic set to be banned for Oxford street traders,"City streets traders in Oxford will be stopped from using single-use plastics in the spring ahead of a national ban in October. The city council is banning vendors from using a variety of plastic utensils, cups and containers from April.  The Green Party, which spearheaded the plan, said the move had public backing.  The government says England uses 2.7 billion items of single-use cutlery a year.  The council's licensing committee voted for the ban at a meeting on Monday following a year-long campaign by members of the Greens and Liberal Democrats. Its decision is set to be ratified by full council in March. ""We know that single-use plastics have a massive environmental impact - both in their production and their contribution to problems of littering,"" Green councillor Lois Muddiman said.  ""That's why it's incredibly welcome that the city council has taken this crucial step in ensuring that street traders are required to use sustainable alternatives."" A public consultation at the end of 2022 found 79% were in favour of a ban. ""Only two respondents were from traders and the overall feedback was very positive,"" Ms Muddiman said.  An ""awful lot"" of street vendors were already using cardboard and bamboo, she added.  Julie Kleeman, co-owner of Taste Tibet in the city, has been selling street food at markets and touring festivals since 2014.  ""Back then we were the only people using compostable, recyclable wares, we never considered taking a cheaper route and it's easy to source more environmentally friendly containers now. ""There's a wealth of competition online which is pushing prices down and access has never been better, especially since the pandemic when takeaways became a big thing,"" she said. Monitoring officers will carry out ""spot checks"" and ""hopefully the public will report"" traders who flout the new law, Ms Muddiman said. Fines would only be imposed as a last resort. Last month, the government announced its own ""far-reaching"" ban on single-use plastic, claiming more than 95% of those who responded to its consultation were in favour of it being scrapped.

Borders battery energy scheme passes planning hurdle,"Plans for a huge Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) in the Borders have moved a step forward. Scottish Borders Council has decided not to object to the proposals but has suggested a number of conditions should be imposed. The final say on the proposals by Zenobe Energy near Eccles will lie with the Scottish government. The scheme would see up to 132 large units installed to store power generated from renewables.  The units - which are about 37m (120ft) long, 16m (50ft) wide - would be located close to a sub-station in the area. Developers Zenobe said that once commissioned it would be one of the biggest schemes of its kind in Europe, making a ""significant contribution"" towards meeting carbon reduction targets. The development would not generate electricity but instead provides a location where it can be imported, stored and exported to meet the demands of the national grid network. The Borders is home to a large number of wind farms and the site would be able to store energy for use when the turbines are not turning. A report to councillors said it would result in some ""minor landscape and visual impacts"". However, it concluded that it could help towards meeting national energy targets and a transition towards net zero. Planning committee chairman Simon Mountford said it was ""vital infrastructure"" and was a consequence of the move towards more renewable energy. ""When the wind doesn't blow we don't get any electricity,"" he said. ""So it is important we have the storage facilities in battery infrastructure.  ""I would expect probably that we will have more of these applications in the coming years."" The scheme is part of a £750m planned investment by Zenobe across Scotland with other sites at Blackhillock in Moray and Kilmarnock South. If approved, it is hoped work on the Borders scheme could start later this year and go live in early 2026. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-64538059
Richard Sharp: BBC chairman denies arranging loan for Boris Johnson,"BBC chairman Richard Sharp has denied that he helped arrange a loan for Boris Johnson when he was prime minister. Mr Sharp was questioned by MPs over his role in loan talks involving Mr Johnson, which came before the then-PM nominated him to chair the BBC board. The government has previously said Mr Sharp was appointed on merit. Mr Sharp told the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee on Tuesday he had not given Mr Johnson financial advice. The MPs robustly questioned Mr Sharp, with one telling him she could not understand why he had not been ""open and transparent"" about his involvement in the loan discussions during his appointment process. Mr Sharp confirmed he had introduced his friend Sam Blyth to Cabinet Secretary Simon Case in late 2020, which was shortly before his appointment at the BBC. Mr Sharp has previously said Mr Blyth had offered to act as guarantor on a loan - reportedly worth up to £800,000 - after reading about Mr Johnson's money troubles in the media.  On Tuesday, Mr Sharp agreed with acting committee chairman Damian Green that he had ""acted as a sort of introduction agency"" between Mr Blyth and Mr Case. He said he then ""raised with Mr Blyth the fact that I'd submitted my application to be the chair of the BBC and that therefore, to avoid a conflict, or perception of conflict, I could have - and we agreed - no further participation in whatever transpired whatsoever. And I didn't."" Although he accepted he was ""a go-between"" for Mr Blyth and the Cabinet Office, he added: ""I did not provide and have not provided the former prime minister personal financial advice. I know nothing about his [financial] affairs, I never have done. I didn't facilitate a loan. ""I've nothing to do with it whatsoever. I'm not party to anything that then happened or didn't happen. I've no knowledge of a bank. I've no knowledge of the actual loan."" Mr Sharp, a former investment banker and Conservative donor, described his relationship with Mr Johnson as ""broadly professional"", and that he only knew of the prime minister's financial issues from press reports. It had not crossed his mind to mention the loan discussion when he appeared in front of the committee during his appointment process, he said. Asked whether he regretted not doing so, Mr Sharp replied: ""Obviously I regret this situation."" But Labour MP Kevin Brennan accused the BBC chairman of a ""monumental failure of judgment"" in not disclosing it. Another Labour MP, Julie Elliott, told Mr Sharp that ""it sounds, sitting here, that you were hiding it, that's how it comes across"", which he said was not the case. She asked if he could see that his involvement could be perceived as a conflict of interest. He replied: ""I can see with the benefit of hindsight, particularly with some of the assertions that have been made, that that is a perfectly legitimate issue for you to raise."" At the time, Mr Sharp did tell the cabinet secretary about his conversation with Mr Blyth. The Sunday Times reported on his involvement in the loan discussions last month. Mr Sharp said: ""It's manifest that this has cause embarrassment for the BBC and I regret that."" He added: ""I acted in good faith to ensure that the rules were followed and in that sense I have no regret for that.""

Letter sent after Charles Dickens' death to go on display,"A letter sent by Charles Dickens' son shortly after the author's death is to go on display.   The letter, dated 29 June 1870, was written by Dickens' first-born son, Charlie, and offered thanks for condolences after his father's death. It has been donated to an exhibition at the Guildhall Museum in Rochester, Kent, and will be on show later this year.   Medway Council has expressed its gratitude for the donation.  Charles Dickens has strong links to the local area. He spent some of his childhood in Chatham and his final years at Gad's Hill in Higham, near Rochester.  Various locations in and around Rochester featured in many of his novels.  Charlie Dickens' letter was addressed to Francis M Webb Esq, Hon Secretary, Rochester Book Society. He thanked the society for their ""kind address of condolence"".  Both the envelope and the letter feature a heavy black border to mark the author's death. Stephen Downham, a Dickens enthusiast, donated the letter as he wanted to find it a new home before moving abroad. Harry Whinney and Ian Dickens, Charles Dickens' great, great grandsons, delivered the letter to Rochester. It will be put on display in The Making of Mr Dickens exhibition later this year.  The exhibition was officially opened by Her Majesty The Queen Consort in February 2022. Councillor Howard Doe, deputy leader of Medway Council, said: ""The letter will make an excellent addition to our exhibition which celebrates one of England's finest writers.""

Chester Storyhouse chief executive to step down after 17 years,"The founding chief executive of Chester's Storyhouse is to step down after 17 years. Andrew Bentley helped create the city's largest performing arts venue which attracts more than one million visitors each year. He said it had been an ""enormous privilege"" to lead the charity but was ""ready to make a change"". A spokesman for Storyhouse said it would begin the search for his successor imminently. The £37m arts building, which houses a theatre, library, independent cinema, restaurant and rooftop bar, opened in 2007. It followed a two-and-a-half-year project to transform the city's former Odeon cinema. ""Together with my previous artistic director, Alex Clifton and the team, we managed to build and create a true community space, a 'third space' outside home and work, and it is this I am most proud of,"" he said.  Storyhouse also runs a regional open-air theatre, Grosvenor Park Open-Air Theatre, which Mr Bentley created in 2010 with Mr Clifton.  Mr Bentley, who received a BEM in the Queen's 2020 Birthday Honours List for services to arts and libraries, added: ""My children have grown up in and around Storyhouse and it will continue to hold a very special place in myself and my family's hearts."" David Watson, chairman of the board of trustees, thanked Mr Bentley ""for his outstanding contribution, and for leading the organisation with such energy, passion and resilience"".

East Kent maternity deaths: Scandal-hit trust sets out action plan,"An NHS trust is rolling out an action plan after a watchdog found services were still unsafe following a damning report into care last autumn. East Kent Hospitals will take measures after the the Care Quality Commission (CQC) raised concerns last month. The trust is also writing to all residents in east Kent after last October's independent review found dozens of babies died unnecessarily. The trust has been approached by the BBC for comment. The review, which was chaired by Dr Bill Kirkup CBE, concluded that at least 45 babies might have survived with better care at the trust. Board papers for trust directors this week said areas of concern raised by the CQC in January were fire safety, foetal monitoring and escalation, maternity triage and infection control. A serious incident in July identified maternity triage risks, including women not being seen within 15 minutes of arrival due to staffing challenges, and women not being reviewed by the doctor in the appropriate time because of lack of dedicated obstetric medical cover. Mark Norman, health correspondent, BBC South East Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that there are still ongoing problems within the maternity departments at East Kent.  The issues revealed by the Kirkup report were systemic and of such scale that everyone realised there were no quick fixes. But as the trust itself acknowledges in this week's board meeting, the recent Care Quality Commission inspection was ""disappointing"" and ""underlines the reality that we have still issues to address"".  Many families who were affected by this scandal will be frustrated by the slow progress but equally determined to make sure the trust holds good to its promise to ""fundamentally transform"" the way it works - with what the trust describes as a ""commitment to openness and honesty"".  Following the Kirkup report, board members are also being asked to approve a open letter to east Kent residents. The draft letter listed Dr Kirkup's findings, including that clinical care was not good enough, and that the trust did not listen to women, families and at times, its own staff. It said the report highlighted that care lacked kindness and compassion and the consequences were devastating. It added that the board had apologised unreservedly. Improvements were being made, the letter said, but it added: ""While we have made some progress, there have been previous efforts to tackle some of these problems and they have not been successful.  ""We are determined to make sure that does not happen again."" Residents with questions or concerns are encouraged to contact the trust.

Norwich surgeon given warning over life-changing injuries,"A Norfolk surgeon who left two patients with life-changing injuries has received a formal warning by a disciplinary panel. Camilo Valero Valdivieso was found guilty of ""serious misconduct"" by an independent medical panel after two operations went wrong in six days. One of his patients, Paul Tooth, 65, said his life was ""a constant struggle"" since his operation in January 2020. However, the panel found the surgeon had ""learned from these events"". Mr Valero will continue to practise at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital (NNUH) and has 28 days to appeal the outcome.   He has been contacted for comment. The findings from the Medical Practitioners Service (MPTS) panel said that his actions had ""risked damaging public confidence in the profession"".  It heard that he twice ""misinterpreted the anatomy"" - on one occasion severing a patient's gallbladder.  The panel also concluded Mr Valero's fitness to practise was not currently impaired, allowing him to continue working. During Mr Tooth's surgery in January 2020, a tube carrying bile from the liver and gallbladder to the small intestine was removed inappropriately, the panel heard. It was told the surgeon also failed to seek assistance from another experienced consultant. Mr Tooth, a former RAF Engineer, has had to undergo further surgery and live with a tube connected to his liver for 16 months.  Speaking after the result, he said: ""The whole thing has left me utterly devastated and I'm really worried about what the future holds. ""Today's decision is just the first step in my seeking accountability from all those involved in allowing me and others to be irreparably harmed by the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital."" He is calling for future investigations at the NNUH to be more transparent and said he wanted answers over why these cases were not escalated more quickly. A second patient, Lucy Wilson, 35, said she lives with a range of long-term issues following a gallbladder operation carried out by Mr Valero.  She said she was ""beyond broken"" by the tribunal decision. Mother-of-two Ms Wilson said: ""We may as well have not come forward. ""The operation has ruined my life and I'm practically housebound now, unable to enjoy the family days out we used to have."" The panel found Mr Valero's conduct ""fell far short of the standards expected from a doctor"" and that he had ""put patients at unwarranted risk of harm"".   However, it said, the training and supervision he had received since meant it was ""highly unlikely"" he would put patients at risk in the future.  The panel also heard evidence he was ""a valued member of the surgical team"" and was ""respected and well-regarded"". In a statement, Erika Denton, the hospital's medical director, said she accepted the decision and apologised to the two patients who experienced serious injuries and complications.   She added: ""We fully investigated the incidents at the time and commissioned the Royal College of Surgeons (RSC) to review what happened, which resulted in a number of changes to strengthen our surgery processes. ""Mr Valero has expressed his profound sorrow and apologises for the errors that occurred during these two laparoscopic cholecystectomies.""

Millions face threat of flooding from glacial lakes,"Up to 15 million people face risk of catastrophic flooding from glacial lakes which could burst their natural dams at any moment, a new study finds. The study led by Newcastle University is the first global attempt to map potential hotspots for such floods. As the climate warms, glaciers retreat and meltwater collects, forming lakes. The impact of global warming on glacial lake floods is yet to be defined, but it has increased both the volume and number of glacial lakes worldwide. The study published in the journal Nature Communications assessed the conditions of lakes and the number of people living downstream from them, which has also increased significantly.  'There are a large number of people globally exposed to the impacts of these floods,"" said Rachel Carr, a glaciologist at Newcastle University and an author on the paper.   ""It could happen at any point - that's what makes them particularly dangerous, because it's hard to predict exactly when they will happen."" The authors say those facing the greatest threat live in mountainous countries in Asia and South America. People living in India, Pakistan, Peru and China account for over half of those at risk. In Asia, around one million people live within just 10km of a glacial lake. ""It's how close people are to those lakes, and their capacity to respond to the disaster that's important,"" said Dr Carr. ""People have done a lot of inventory studies [of the lakes] ... but our study has flipped that around. ""What's downstream matters just as much, if not more. I think it's an important reframing in the way we think about it."" Lakes formed by melting glaciers have natural dams of loose rocks and ice that can fail suddenly and unpredictably. The floods that follow come thick and fast, in many cases being powerful enough to destroy vital infrastructure. Dam failures are complex, but are often triggered when a lump of rock or ice falls into the lake from the surrounding mountains. That causes a wave to travel across the lake like a tsunami, destabilising the dam as it reaches it.  Other factors include a gradual build-up of meltwater, increasing pressure against the dam and melting any ice cores holding it together.  Rather than try to predict which dams were most likely to fail, the study's authors looked at which lakes would pose the most danger if they burst out. They also stress the importance of early warning systems such as time-lapse cameras. ""It's an important paper,' said Stephan Harrison, a leading expert on the impact of climate change on glacial lakes at the University of Exeter, who was not involved in the research. ""It alerts policymakers to the likely impact of future climate change."" Dr Harrison added that the research was only a first step towards better understanding of the impact of climate change on what are known as glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). That relationship is complex and made harder to prove by what scientists suspect to be a long time lag between cause and effect. Research shows that an increase in floods which began in the early 20th Century and peaked in the 1970s could be a lagged response to climatic changes in the past. While scientists expect that glacial floods will increase as a result of human-induced climate change, there has as yet been no such increase.

State of the Union: How Brandon Tsay is using his sudden fame,"Brandon Tsay was at home, getting ready to have lunch, when he got a call from the White House. Would he be free to speak with the President of the United States?  ""I said something along the lines of: ""No we're about to eat"". And then I was like: Oh wait, it's the president!"" the 26-year-old told the BBC. ""My brain kind of short-circuited there."" The president had good reason to call. Mr Tsay has received praise from his community and the press for disarming a gunman who tore through a Lunar New Year celebration on 21 January, killing 11 people at a Monterey Park, California dance hall and injuring several others.  Mr Tsay's split-second decision elevated the quiet coder to a national hero. From the other end of the line, Joe Biden thanked Mr Tsay for ""taking such incredible action in the face of danger"". Then, he invited Mr Tsay to Washington DC. On Tuesday, Mr Tsay will attend President Joe Biden's State of the Union address as a guest of First Lady Jill Biden.  Held each year before the entire US Congress, the speech is mostly political pomp meant to tout a president's agenda.  But the event can achieve moments of genuine emotion, thanks to the guests that the president invites. They put a human face to abstract policy proposals, their personal stories hopefully inspiring lawmakers to act on issues like healthcare, gun safety, and education. Few have a story like Mr Tsay's. ""I want the [Asian American and Pacific Islander] community to be hopeful, and I think by sending me to the State of the Union that could draw some attention to the people in our community,"" Mr Tsay said.  Monterey Park is a majority Asian-American community.  And, he added, ""a lot of people back home told me I should wave at the camera for them."" The State of the Union appearance will be the culmination of two surreal and disorienting weeks for Mr Tsay, in which he went from an anonymous young man who took tickets at his family dance studio to a national figure. ""I'm still the same person, I'm still Brandon,"" he insists. But the world around him has changed. He is also, he admits, exhausted. Mr Tsay has told the story of how he stopped the Monterey Park gunman over, and over, and over, to the New York Times and Good Morning America and CNN and many outlets in between.  After firing into the Star Ballroom Dance Studio in Monterey Park, 72-year-old suspect Huu Can Tran went to Lai Lai Ballroom in nearby Alhambra, which was owned by the Tsay family.  Mr Tsay was the first person to encounter the gunman when he came through the door, and made the quick decision to disarm him. Security camera footage later showed a prolonged struggle for the weapon before Mr Tsay took control. Authorities credited him for preventing a second massacre. In the days following the shooting, family members stepped in to arrange interviews and manage the avalanche of media requests for Mr Tsay. During the frenzy, he did not even have time to talk to his family about what had happened to him, he said. They insisted he rest, and he took a break from interviews. But he could not evade the spotlight for long. The city of Alhambra honoured him in a special Lunar New Year ceremony last week. ""The carnage would have been so much worse had it not been for Brandon Tsay,"" Representative Judy Chu, the congresswoman representing Monterey Park, told the crowd. The governor of California showed up at his house and sat on his couch. Then he got the call from the president. Next thing he knew, he and his father were on a plane to Washington, where he spent Monday touring the monuments. Mr Tsay is trying to put his newfound attention towards a greater purpose.  ""I feel closer to the community, as a person would,"" he said.  ""I feel like our family now is a more integral part of our society, and our Asian community around Monterey Park. We feel like we're more bonded, now."" After well-wishers tried to send him financial support, he partnered with the Asian Pacific Community Fund to raise money in his name to give back to the community.  He donated an initial $2,500 (£2,000) to the Brandon Tsay Hero Fund, using money his family received after the shooting, with hopes to grow that amount many times over.  ""I feel like people have been calling me a hero, and I think that there's a hero in all of us,"" Mr Tsay said.  ""I hope to show that there is this bravery and courage that you might not even know exists, but it's there inside.""  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64561135
Russia's African footprint grows with Lavrov trip to Mali,"Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has promised continued military support for Mali, which has been battling a jihadist insurgency since 2012. Last year, Mali turned its back on former colonial power France favouring help from Russia instead. This is the foreign minister's second visit to Africa in two weeks. Russia aims to shore up allies as the Ukraine war continues, but its involvement in West Africa pre-dates that and has been growing over time. Mr Lavrov, who is on a two-day trip to Mali, outlined Moscow's ambition to provide military backing for governments across West Africa in the battle against Islamist militants. Mali's military government has batted away criticism of this shift to Russia. ""We will no longer justify our choice of partner. Russia is here on demand by Mali and responds efficiently to our strategic needs,"" Mali's Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Diop said during a joint press briefing with his Russian counterpart. It is now more than a year since Wagner Group fighters began operating in Mali, though the authorities have never formally confirmed this. But evidence suggests that they have not been any more successful than other forces in dealing with the decade-long jihadist threat and insecurity may have worsened. Civilian casualties as a result of violence more than doubled last year, according to data from the crisis mapping organisation Acled Info. Nevertheless, Mali's military junta has dismissed reports about the country's deteriorating security situation as ""fake news"".  It has instead lionised Moscow for empowering the Malian armed forces after despatching heavy military equipment to Bamako on several occasions since the army seized power in August 2020.  These include Sukhoi fighter jets, as well as surveillance and combat helicopters. ""The military success we achieved in the past two years outweighs anything that was done in past decades. Our weapons are the pride of the entire nation,"" Mali's interim President Col Assimi Goïta said in a speech on army day last month. He said that people had been able to return to their homes but did not offer specific examples. Yet, the presence of Russian mercenaries abruptly halted a decade of efforts by France and its European allies to bolster Mali's attempts to counter the jihadists.  Wagner's deployment was in response to waning patience with French forces which had initially made significant strides against militants when first deployed in 2013. The capacity of the nearly 18,000-strong UN peacekeeping mission (Minusma) to protect civilians threatens to be weakened with the impending withdrawal of nearly 3,000 troops from Germany, the UK, Ivory Coast and Benin. Attacks by branches of the Islamic State group and al-Qaeda have over time spread into neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger, while militant activity is gradually moving south towards the Gulf of Guinea. Emboldened by their work in Mali as well as its success in influencing public opinion, Wagner is making overtures to Burkina Faso - which experienced two military coups in 2022 - and possibly Ivory Coast. But concerns have been raised about the way Wagner Group fighters operate and the UN has demanded investigations into possible war crimes by Malian soldiers and the mercenaries, which Malian authorities consistently deny. Rights groups have documented reports of torture, summary executions and sexual assaults during joint counterinsurgency operations dubbed Keletigui that began in December 2021. Analysis of data from Acled shows that civilians died in larger numbers than militants in such operations in 2022. At least 700 people were killed in incidents involving the mercenaries, largely in the volatile central regions of Mali. One of the highest death tolls came in March 2022 when at least 300 people were reportedly killed in week-long counterinsurgency operations in the central town of Moura. Survivors told Human Rights Watch that Malian soldiers and ""white soldiers speaking in a strange language"" summarily executed dozens of men. The army denied this and instead talked about how its forces had become stronger thank to Russian instructors and military equipment. The Wagner Group - which the US alleged were contracted at a cost of $10m (£8.3m) per month - has not publicly commented on its activities in Mali. Rather, propaganda associated with the mercenaries has inflated their military capabilities particularly in Mali and sought to discredit France and the West. This has been widely spread on social media and the pro-Wagner messages gain some public appeal when they were shared by those Malian pressure groups which have held protests agitating for increased co-operation with Moscow. Wagner Group founder Yevgeny Prigozhin has cheered the propaganda campaigns as ""the new era of decolonisation"", exploiting long-standing distrust of former colonial power France. People and organisations trying to scrutinise Russia's influence and Wagner operations have come under attack, which has led some to fear for their safety. Last March, Mali banned broadcasts by French public media outfits RFI and France 24 over their reports on alleged atrocities by Wagner and Mali's army. The government accused them of ""sowing hatred and ascribing an ethnic angle to the insecurity in Mali"". Prominent activist Aminata Dicko was forced into hiding last week after pro-junta activists accused her of being unpatriotic for outlining alleged atrocities by the army and Wagner mercenaries while addressing the UN Security Council.  At the weekend, the junta later expelled Minusma's human rights chief for purportedly collaborating with Ms Dicko. The authorities have trumpeted military gains, but overall deaths from violence have increased between 2021 - when there were 1,913 fatalities - and 2022, which had 4,803 fatalities.  Last month, Mali's Ministry of Health and Social Development said humanitarian needs had spiked by 17% compared with 2022 because of mass displacements induced by militant violence. In addition, mounting claims of civilian casualties by Wagner and the Mali army have given militant groups ammunition to stage retaliatory attacks and expand recruitment. About a third of propaganda statements issued by the al-Qaeda affiliate JNIM in 2022 explicitly mentioned the Wagner Group as a target or used their presence to justify anti-army attacks. Its IS-linked rivals also said they had killed 15 mercenaries and downed a drone belonging to the Wagner Group. Despite these concerns, Russian, and Wagner, assistance to Mali looks set to continue. During his visit to Mali, Mr Lavrov described how ""Russian aviation equipment"" was used to ""carry out successful operations against terrorists in recent times"". But perhaps more significantly, he hinted that Russia could help others in the region dealing with a similar jihadist threat saying that ""this concerns Guinea, Burkina Faso and Chad and the Sahel region generally and even the coastal states on the Gulf of Guinea"". Amid Russia's international isolation following its invasion of Ukraine, it is a friendship that can only blossom. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64555169
Turkey earthquake: Bodies in street after quake as anger grows over aid,"Bodies of people killed in the earthquake in southern Turkey on Monday are being left out on the street as the hunt continues for survivors. More than 5,000 people are known to have died in Turkey and northern Syria, which was also devastated by the quake. The United Nations warned that thousands of children may be among the dead. Monday's 7.8 magnitude quake struck at 04:17 (01:17 GMT) near the city of Gaziantep.  A later tremor was nearly as big, with its epicentre in the Elbistan district of Kahramanmaras province. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has announced a three-month state of emergency in the 10 provinces worst affected by the earthquake. He said the measures would allow relief workers and financial aid into the affected regions but did not give further details. Around 70 countries are sending aid to Turkey, but there is growing anger in some places that help is not arriving fast enough.  In the city of Antakya, some of the dead were left laid out on the pavement for hours as rescue workers and ambulances struggled to cope with the scale of the disaster. Family members of those missing combed through the rubble looking for their loved ones. A group of men using sledgehammers and other tools found the bodies of a man and a young girl who were trapped. They called to official rescuers to use their power tools to help, but they said they had to concentrate on the living.  The men kept digging until the bodies were freed. There is growing anger that there isn't enough help. One woman told the BBC that rescuers came and took pictures of the building belonging to her boyfriend's family where they believed 11 people were trapped, but they didn't return.  She said they heard voices for hours, but then there was silence.  Further north in Kahramanmaras, close to the epicentre of the second quake, there is a delay in help arriving because the mountainous roads are gridlocked by those trying to leave. Rows of buildings have collapsed into piles of debris that rescuers are trying to cope with, while a bitterly cold wind blew smoke and dust from the rubble into their eyes. Survivors now living on the streets are having to hunt for food and to burn furniture they find to keep warm. Temperatures are expected to drop below freezing later this week. It's a similar situation in the port city of Iskenderun, where now homeless people are taking shelter in open space away from buildings. One woman the BBC spoke to is sheltering with her children and grandchildren, including a six-year-old who has epilepsy. Relief workers have brought them duvets and they have been given some bread but there has been no other support so far.  ""I'm devastated,"" a doctor at a local hospital told Reuters. ""I see bodies inside, everywhere. Although I'm used to seeing bodies because of my expertise, it's very difficult also for me."" The port in Iskenderun has been closed until further notice because of a major fire, meaning ships carrying cargo bound for the earthquake disaster zone are being diverted. The blaze is thought to have been caused when an oil-filled shipping container tipped over as a result of the earthquake and then flames spread to the surrounding freight.  Emergency services are having trouble getting access to the site because of damage from the quake and other containers now blocking the entrance. An attempt to use a fire-fighting boat to tackle the blaze has failed. There have also been reports of difficulties getting aid to northern Syria, especially in opposition-held areas. Control there is divided between the government and other opposition groups. They remain embroiled in conflict as a result of an ongoing civil war. Even before the earthquake the situation in much of the region was critical, with freezing weather, crumbling infrastructure and a cholera outbreak causing misery for many of those who live there. More than four million people, mainly women and children, were already relying on aid.  The north-west especially has become one of the hardest places to reach, with only one small crossing on the Turkish border available to transport resources to opposition-held areas.  The UN said on Tuesday that it was temporarily stopping aid flows to Syria because of damage to the route, with no clear idea of when it would restart. Syria's UN envoy has said that any support must come from within the country and not across the border with Turkey, leading those in opposition-held areas to worry that it may be withheld for political reasons.  The scenes of devastation have been interspersed with brief moments of hope. A baby born under the rubble near the city of Afrin has been rescued after being found still attached to its mother, who died after giving birth.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64560339
I've lost seven relatives in the Turkey earthquake,"As the death toll mounts following two huge earthquakes in southern Turkey and northern Syria, many in Scotland are watching in horror.  A rescue operation is under way following Monday's quakes but aid agencies are warning of a mounting humanitarian emergency in the region.  Meanwhile Turkish and Syrian people living in Scotland are struggling to get in touch with relatives caught up in the disaster.  Teyfik Kamber, a chef at Eda Turkish restaurant in Glasgow, says he has lost seven family members in the Turkish city of Elbistan.  He has been unable to contact about 20 friends and family in region and fears the worst.  ""It's been really hard to talk to people,"" the 60-year-old told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. ""It has been very difficult. There's nothing you can say. The feeling is very, very sad, and very hard. So many villages waiting for the roads to open because there's lot of snow.  ""Yesterday we got some messages from members of the family and then today we cannot hear anything from them anymore."" Tekin Esmer, a cafe owner in Galashiels in the Scottish Borders, already knows the young children of his second cousins died after their home in Iskenderun collapsed during the earthquakes. The 47-year-old is still waiting to hear if several uncles and aunts survived in the port town. Tekin, who relocated to Scotland 20 years ago, has been in contact with his two brothers and their families. He said: ""My brothers and their families are now on the streets - their houses are too badly damaged to go back into. ""Last night one of my brothers had only two blankets to keep seven of them warm. They have nothing and their homes are being knocked down as they are unsafe. It is cold there and it is terrifying. ""I know my second cousins are under a building - their children have been brought out dead, and I am waiting for further news. I can only presume they are dead as well."" Tekin, who runs Waffles and Brew, admits he feels helpless being so far from the crisis, but hopes to do what he can from his café in Galashiels. He added: ""If I went there what can I do? ""I feel useless being here but if I can help even a little bit I'll be glad - my customers are putting money into a donation box on my counter, and I'm putting money from my takings and putting that into the fund as well. ""Once I get sorted out I'll try to collect clothing and blankets as well."" Mahmut Tas, who works in Akdeniz supermarket in Edinburgh, said he was worried about his wife's sister, her husband and their children.  He said they could not get in contact with them or anyone else in Kahramanmaras in southern Turkey, where they live.  ""Two days I have been looking at the TV, my wife is crying for home. It's very bad. So many people are affected,"" he said.  Cafar Karaharn, who works at Turkish Kitchen in Aberdeen, said he has family and friends all over the region hit by the earthquake but he has not been able to get in touch with them.  ""It's very scary, heart-breaking and upsetting,"" he said.  He raised concerns about the sub-zero temperatures in the region where many survivors are unable to return to their homes.  He said he had not slept since he saw the first pictures of the devastation caused by the earthquake on television.  ""Sitting and crying and just dropping tears... it's not nice to watch people die in front of our eyes,"" he said.  Nadin Atkin, a Syrian who works at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Scotland she arrived in Aleppo on a family visit 20 minutes after the earthquake hit on Monday morning.  ""When I arrived home the floor was waving and shaking like jelly, so many people were in the streets in their pyjamas, home clothes, slippers with no jackets or warm clothes.  ""We couldn't sleep or eat over the last two days. We are on unstable and unexpectable circumstances where we never know what's going to happen next, I have my bag with our passport, money... ready for any moment we have to leave."" Ms Atkin, who moved to Scotland from Syria in 2008, said people had been left homeless and without food.  ""Hundreds of buildings have been destroyed over the heads of its residents. So many homes have become large graves,"" she said.  ""The international community and everyone who wishes to send aid to the afflicted region must allocate a fair share of that aid to the forgotten region.  ""Aid must enter by air and land into north-western Syria as soon as possible. The opportunity is lost for those trapped under the rubble and for those who spent last night outside in the cold and snow."" UK firefighters including some from Scotland are heading to Turkey to help with the rescue effort. Meanwhile a Scottish Turkish charity has set up collection points in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and St Andrews to gather donations for victims of the earthquakes.  The Association of Turkish Alumni and Students in Scotland (ATAS) has arranged a plane to transport food, clothing and blankets to Turkey on Friday.  It said all sorts of donations were needed but funding was the most important.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-64557678
China spy balloon: US Navy releases photos of debris,"The US Navy has released photos of a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that was shot out of the sky on Saturday. The US Fleet Forces Command posted several photos on its Facebook page showing large debris of the balloon being hauled into a boat. The post said the sailors retrieving the debris on Sunday were part of the Navy's specialist explosives team. The device will now be examined to see whether it was indeed spy equipment. US officials have described the balloon as being about 200 ft (60m) tall, with the payload portion comparable in size to regional airliners and weighing hundreds - or potentially thousands - of pounds.  China has repeatedly insisted that the ""airship is for civilian use and entered the US due to force majeure - it was completely an accident"". The discovery of the balloon set off a diplomatic crisis, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken immediately calling off a weekend trip to China - the first such high level US-China meeting there in years - over the ""irresponsible act"".  The balloon was retrieved off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, a day after being shot down by a fighter jet. The navy said the debris was spread over seven miles (11km) of the Atlantic Ocean, and two naval ships - including one with a heavy crane for recovery - were sent to the area. However, the photos reveal the piles of balloon material were able to be pulled aboard by hand. The US military has also deployed unmanned underwater vehicles as part of the search effort.  Experts say that the wreckage of the balloon could provide the US with valuable insight into Chinese aerial surveillance technology and techniques, allowing them to better understand what the balloon was capable of and how it transmitted information.  Efforts to recover the balloon's equipment, however, have been complicated by the need to ensure that US personnel are kept safe from potentially dangerous materials, such as explosives or battery components.  US defence officials first announced they were tracking the strange object on Thursday, and waited until it was safely over water before shooting it down. Footage on US TV networks showed the balloon falling to the sea after a small explosion. On Friday, the Pentagon said a second Chinese spy balloon had been spotted - this time over Latin America with reported sightings over Costa Rica and Venezuela. Colombia's Air Force says an identified object - believed to be a balloon - was detected on 3 February in the country's airspace at above 55,000ft. It says it followed the object until it left the airspace, adding that it did not represent a threat to national security. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64562100
Turkey-Syria earthquake: Newborn baby pulled from collapsed building,"A newborn baby girl has been saved by rescuers from beneath the rubble of a building in north-western Syria that was destroyed by Monday's earthquake. Her mother went into labour soon after the disaster and gave birth before she died, a relative said. Her father, four siblings and an aunt were also killed. Dramatic footage showed a man carrying the baby, covered in dust, after she was pulled from debris in Jindayris. A doctor at a hospital in nearby Afrin said she was now in a stable condition.  The building in which her family lived was one of about 50 reportedly destroyed by the 7.8-magnitude earthquake in Jindayris, an opposition-held town in Idlib province that is close to the Turkish border. The baby's uncle, Khalil al-Suwadi, said relatives rushed to the scene when they learned of the collapse. ""We heard a voice while we were digging,"" he told AFP news agency on Tuesday. ""We cleared the dust and found the baby with the umbilical cord [intact], so we cut it and my cousin took her to hospital."" Paediatrician Hani Maarouf said the baby arrived at his hospital in a bad condition, with ""several bruises and lacerations over all her body"". ""She also arrived with hypothermia because of the harsh cold. We had to warm her up and administer calcium,"" he added.  She was photographed lying in an incubator and connected to a drip, as a joint funeral was held for her mother Afraa, father Abdullah and her four siblings. They are among 1,800 people known to have been killed by the earthquake in Syria, according to the Damascus-based government and the White Helmets, whose volunteer first responders operate in opposition-held areas.  Another 4,500 people have been killed in Turkey, where the epicentre was.   The White Helmets have so far reported 1,020 deaths, but they have warned that figure is expected to ""rise dramatically"". ""Time is running out. Hundreds still trapped under the rubble. Every second could mean saving a life,"" they tweeted on Tuesday.  ""We appeal to all humanitarian organisations and international bodies to provide material support and assistance to organisations responding to this disaster."" The UN has vowed to use ""any and all means"" possible to get aid to people in the north-west, but it has said that deliveries have been halted temporarily due to damaged roads and other logistical issues. It has also urged governments not to politicise aid delivery when so many are in desperate need.  A UN Security Council agreement authorises the use of just one border crossing for deliveries from Turkey into the north-west. All other deliveries are meant to go via Damascus, although in the past the government has facilitated only a small amount of ""cross-line"" aid. Even before the earthquake struck, 4.1 million people in the north-west - most of them women and children - were relying on humanitarian aid to survive.

Turkey earthquake: Mexico sends its famed search and rescue dogs,"Mexico is sending some of its famous search and rescue dogs to Turkey to help look for people buried under rubble following the earthquake. A plane with 16 dogs on board took off from Mexico City earlier on Tuesday.  Mexico, which is prone to earthquakes, has highly specialised civilian and military teams which are often deployed to help when disasters strike. The dogs won the hearts of Mexicans during the country's 2017 quake, when they saved several lives. A yellow Labrador Retriever named Frida gained international fame when she was seen searching for survivors in Mexico City wearing protective goggles and boots.  The navy credited Frida with saving 12 lives and locating 40 bodies in operations across Mexico, Haiti, Guatemala and Ecuador. While Frida died of old age last year, at least one of her canine colleagues from the 2017 Mexico quake will form part of Mexican Navy team travelling to Turkey. Ecko, a Belgian Malinois, was seen at the airport in Mexico City with his navy handler. But the deployment is not just a military one. The civilian search and rescue group Los Topos de Tlatelolco (The Moles of Tlatelolco) is also on its way. The group of highly experienced volunteers had messaged Mexico's Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard offering their help.  Within hours, Mr Ebrard responded that transport had been arranged for them with the help of the Turkish embassy in Mexico City. The foreign minister also posted a video of a member of the Red Cross with his four-legged companion on board the plane.  In the recording, Ángel Daniel Hernández says he has been training his German Shepherd Rex since he adopted him five years ago. Mexico is not the only country sending dogs to help with the rescue efforts in Turkey and Syria.  Croatia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Libya, Poland, Switzerland, the UK and the United States are all also deploying canines with their handlers.  The animals are often used in areas where the use of heavy machinery could cause the rubble to collapse further, putting the lives of survivors at risk. The dogs are trained to sniff out humans and alert their handlers by barking and scratching the ground where the smell is strongest.  Mexican officials say their mission is ""to save lives"" and while the dogs can detect the smell of bodies as well as that of those who are buried under the rubble alive, the hope is that their quick deployment will result in rescues rather than recoveries.

State of the Union 2023: Chinese balloon looms large over Biden's speech,"Joe Biden's State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday comes at a pivotal time in his presidency.  By most indications, he is poised to announce a bid for re-election next year, and the speech provides a high-profile platform from which he can make his case to the American people, the media and key figures within the Democratic Party. Before the president gets to that, however, he will be under intense pressure to address the issue that has been hovering over his administration since Friday. The Chinese spy balloon, and the US reaction to it, has dominated headlines, captivated the attention of the American public and prompted sharp criticism of the Biden administration from Republicans. With the Republican-controlled House of Representatives considering holding a vote of disapproval for how the president handled the balloon incursion - on the day of the speech no less - and aggressive hearings into the situation already being planned, Mr Biden will be expected to offer the reasoning behind his decision to shoot the vessel down only after it had traversed the US.  And all eyes will be on how Congress reacts.  While Mr Biden and his advisers may have a strategy devised for how they want to craft his re-election bid, a foreign crisis with China, which could have significant economic and military consequences, could derail even the best-laid plans. His speech is likely to dwell extensively on accomplishments in the first two years of his presidency, when his party controlled both chambers of Congress and was able to pass a variety of substantive legislation.  Those achievements included a $1.9tn (£1.5tn) coronavirus relief package that featured a programme that halved the US child poverty rate and $1tn in climate and healthcare legislation. He is also sure to tout bipartisan legislative achievements on gun control, infrastructure spending and technology investment. The president will make the case that the economy is improving under his watch, citing the latest job-growth figures and inflation and energy numbers that have been tapering off from high levels not seen since the early 1980s. When he's done patting himself on the back, however, Mr Biden will have to cast his eyes forward and make the case for what he hopes to accomplish in the remainder of his first term and what he could offer if he does seek four more years in office after that.  Successful political campaigns, as the established wisdom goes, are about the future, not the past. To that end, Mr Biden is planning on making the phrase ""finish the job"" a recurring theme during his speech. It's a call for Congress to do more, but it also gives the president the opportunity to declare some measure of victory if he successfully implements the programmes launched by the Democratic Congress over the past two years. With the recent spate of mass shootings, Mr Biden may talk about new gun control legislation, including the kind of ban on assault weapons he helped enact as a senator in the 1990s. He may also call for federal law protecting abortion rights, an issue that helped turn out Democratic voters in last year's midterm elections.  Government-supported childcare and pre-kindergarten education are also long-desired but yet-to-be tackled components of the Democratic agenda. And, in the wake of the death of Tyre Nichols at the hands of Memphis police, he might endorse renewed efforts to enact federal policing reform. Mr Biden could also address issues of perceived weakness during his presidency, including rising crime rates in US cities, the rise in undocumented migrants crossing the US-Mexico border and an attempt to forgive some student-loan debt that has faced multiple lawsuits.  While US-China relations are sure to dominate any foreign policy portion of Mr Biden's address, he is also certain to discuss the need for continued American military aid to Ukraine and the effect the tens of billions in aid already approved has had in turning back the Russian invasion. Whatever Biden proposes on any of these issues will crash headfirst into the reality of Republican control of the House of Representatives. Although the conservative margin in that chamber is narrow, it is enough to ensure that none of Mr Biden's ideas will pass, or even receive an up-or-down vote, without tacit Republican approval. While there is always the possibility of bipartisan agreement - and Mr Biden will do his best to present himself as a voice of reason and co-operation - the coming year is more likely to centre on acrimonious fights over avoiding a US default on its national debt this summer and passing legislation that will fund the US government in the autumn.  Mr Biden may use his address on Tuesday night as a means to gain the upper hand in negotiations that are only just beginning. The president's speech could provide a blueprint for how he will handle these fraught confrontations with Republicans and address the growing US-China rift. It will also shed light on the terrain upon which he may want to build his re-election campaign, including which issues to prioritise and which accomplishments to trumpet the loudest. While the delivery of a State of the Union address is always scrutinised, the style of Mr Biden's speech will be almost as important as the substance.  The 80-year-old politician is already the oldest president in US history. If he wins re-election, his second term will expire after he turns 86. Questions about Mr Biden's competence will be unavoidable in the days ahead, and high-profile speeches like this are an opportunity to silence critics - or give them more ammunition. Although public opinion surveys 21 months removed from an election are of limited value, the latest numbers show that if Mr Biden takes the plunge he is in for a closely contested campaign, with Republicans - including his former adversary Donald Trump - more than capable of wresting the White House from his grasp. His overall approval has improved but is still net-negative. Polling indicates that Democrats would be more resigned to a Biden re-election campaign than energised by it. Following his address, the president will travel to Wisconsin and Florida - states that are traditional presidential-election battlegrounds and the latter being the home of two possible Republican presidential opponents. Although 21 months may seem like a long time, and the timing of an official campaign announcement has not even been hinted at, Tuesday night's speech is a prominent waypoint on Mr Biden's road to re-election.

State of the Union: Who is on the guest list?,"On Tuesday night, US President Joe Biden will take a short ride from the White House to Capitol Hill and deliver his second State of the Union Address before a joint session of Congress.  All 535 lawmakers - 100 senators and 435 representatives - will be invited, and Vice-President Kamala Harris will be there in her capacity as Senate president.  The annual presidential address is also attended by cabinet members, high-level US military commanders and Supreme Court justices.  Lawmakers, as well as the president and first lady, can invite guests. A president's featured guests are often used to highlight key policy themes being made in the speech. Last year's invitees included Ukraine's ambassador to the US, Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, and teenage diabetes advocate Joshua Davis. Here is what to know about some of the notable guests, including rock star Bono, former ambassador of Afghanistan Roya Rahmani, and the family of Tyre Nichols.  RowVaughn and Rodney Wells, the mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, the 29-year-old man whose death at the hands of Memphis police officers has reignited calls for police reforms, are among the invitees.  They were invited both by Nevada Democratic Representative Steven Horsford, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, and by the White House.  ""It's important for them to be here in the gallery that night to listen to the president,"" Mr Horsford told the New York Times.  ""I have also called for a meeting with the president and White House officials to talk about how we're calling for this issue to be part of the State of the Union address."" The Wells's spoke with Mr Biden last week after five Memphis officers were charged with murder.  The brother of George Floyd, who was killed by police in Minneapolis in 2020, and family members of Michael Brown, who was shot and killed by an officer in Ferguson, Missouri in 2018, will also be in attendance. Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar will host the father of Amir Lock, who was shot and killed by officers serving a no-knock warrant in Minneapolis last year.  Brandon Tsay, 26, made national headlines in January after he disarmed a gunman who had carried out a shooting in Monterey Park, California that left 11 people dead.  He was invited to the State of the Union by California Representative Judy Chu, who told the BBC's US partner CBS that she wasn't the only one to reach out to Mr Tsay. ""Only an hour after I talked to him, President Biden himself asked him to be his guest at the State of the Union. Brandon, how could you turn me down?"" Ms Chu said.  The Irish singer-songwriter and activist is among the 26 people on First Lady Jill Biden's guest list.  In a statement, the White House said that the 62-year-old rock star is a ""ground-breaking activist in the fight against HIV/Aids and extreme poverty"".  Twenty years ago, he played an important role in the ""President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief"" announced by George W Bush and championed by then-Senator Joe Biden. The initiative has been credited with saving 25 million lives worldwide since its launch. The U2 frontman also works with governments around the world to fight poverty and preventable disease and has raised $700m (£584.2m) to combat HIV and Aids in Africa.  Congressman Greg Steube, a Florida Republican, announced his guest will be ""Good Samaritan"" Darrell Woodie, who called for help after Mr Steube was seriously injured in an accident in January.  Mr Steube was hurt after falling about 25ft (7.6m) from a ladder while cutting tree limbs at his home in Sarasota.  Mr Woodie saw the incident and immediately called 911.  The congressman is still recovering from his injuries in Florida, though Mr Woodie will attend the speech as his official guest.  Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs committee, has invited former Afghan ambassador to the US, Roya Rahmani. In 2018, Ms Rahmani became Afghanistan's first female ambassador to Washington DC, where she served between December of that year until the collapse of the Afghan government in July 2021. Before that, she was ambassador to Indonesia and to the Association of South East Asians Nations.  She now has a position as a ""distinguished fellow"" at the Washington DC-based Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security and continues to be an advocate for women living in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.  ""Since the United States unilaterally withdrew from Afghanistan last year, paving the way for the Taliban to take over, the situation for women in the country has become dire. Women there - many of whom only ever knew the freedoms of the last 20 years - no longer have rights,"" Mr McCaul said in a statement.  ""I hope my invitation and Ambassador Rahmani's presence will send a signal to the women of Afghanistan that they have not been forgotten."" Among the other names on the White House's guest list is that of Paul Pelosi, the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  In October 2022, Mr Pelosi was badly injured by a hammer-wielding intruder who entered their home in San Francisco. Authorities believe the attack was politically motivated.  Other White House's guests include Americans from various walks of life, including teachers, medical professionals, students and business leaders.

Organ harvesting plot: Interpreter tried to help transplant bid - court,"A hospital interpreter tried to help persuade doctors to approve an illegal kidney transplant for the daughter of a Nigerian politician, a court has heard.  Evelyn ""Ebere"" Agbasonu allegedly asked for £1,500 to help secure Sonia Ekweremadu's £80,000 transplant at a north London hospital in February 2022.  The prosecution claims the procedure was not legal as the organ donor had no altruistic motive or family connection with the recipient.  Four defendants deny the allegations.  Ms Ekweremadu, 25, her father Ike, 60, and her mother Beatrice, 56, who all have an address in Willesden Green are standing trial. Dr Obinna Obeta, 50, from Southwark, who has been described as the medical middleman, has also been accused of the charges. The Old Bailey has been told the ""transactional"" deal had involved a 21-year-old donor, a street trader from Lagos, who agreed to the harvesting of his body part for up to £7,000 and the promise of opportunities in the UK.  Ms Agbasonu was a long-standing member of staff at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead where she worked as a medical secretary, jurors heard.  She had stepped in to interpret Igbo during an initial meeting on 24 February between Dr Peter Dupont and the donor from Nigeria, who spoke little English.  The consultant had concluded the young man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was not an appropriate candidate and appeared relieved that the transplant would not go ahead, the court heard. Prosecutor Hugh Davies KC said it was ""somewhat extraordinary"" that, according to messages from others, Ms Agbasonu appeared to agree to manipulate a second meeting to the advantage of the Ekweremadu family.  Ike Ekweremadu's medically trained brother Diwe Ekweremadu allegedly sent his daughter advice from the interpreter to show a clear family connection with the donor.  Jurors heard he told Sonia Ekweremadu: ""Ebere said it would be easier to establish that his mum and your mum are sisters. If we stretch it to the grandmum and grandmum the relationship will be too distant.""  Ms Ekweremadu allegedly replied: ""OK that's fine.""  Diwe Ekweremadu then allegedly laid out the financial agreement to her father, saying he had ""met the Igbo interpreter"" and ""she agreed to work with us"", which would also involve ""coaching the boy"". ""She insisted that I give her £1,500. I think they just position themselves to exploit people,"" the court was told he said. He allegedly added that after a meeting with Ms Agbasonu, she had ""advised that (the donor) comes to the hospital on Tuesday and Thursday while Chinoso (Sonia) is having her dialysis.  ""Psychologically everyone in the team will have to accept that he's really committed to his cousin's health and it usually makes it easier to accept the person for the procedure,""  he said. Mr Davies suggested the messages demonstrated the opposite of an altruistic organ donation.  On 11 March, the donor attended a meeting with another surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital and the interpreter, the court heard.  Afterwards, Diwe Ekweremadu allegedly messaged Ike Ekweremadu: ""I have spoken with (the interpreter). She said the boy did better today but he's still showing so much timidity.  ""She covered up for him and added the words as much as possible."" Mr Davies told jurors following the meeting, the surgeon agreed with Dr Dupont that the donor was unsuitable and Ms Ekweremadu was informed of the decision on 29 March. The court also heard Dr Obeta had trained at medical school with Diwe Ekweremadu, who remains in Nigeria and is not on trial.  The defendants all deny conspiring to arrange or facilitate the travel of the young man with a view to exploitation between 1 August 2021 and 5 May 2022.  The trial continues.

"Coldest wind chill ever recorded in continental US, say forecasters","Forecasters say the coldest wind chill ever has been recorded in the continental US as an Arctic cold snap freezes a swathe of North America. The National Weather Service (NWS) said the icy gusts on Mount Washington in New Hampshire on Friday produced a wind chill of -108F (-78C). Nearly 100 million people across the north-eastern US and Canada are shivering in the frigid blast. Authorities warned frostbite could strike in less than 10 minutes. Residents from Manitoba to Maine are being urged to limit their time outdoors until Saturday in the ""once-in-a-generation"" cold snap. The NWS said the actual temperature on the summit of Mount Washington dropped to a low of -47F as of Saturday morning- the coldest ever recorded there by the Mount Washington Observatory.  The combined effect of wind and cold is also expected to bring some of the lowest wind chill temperatures since the 1980s in the New England state of Maine, as well as in Quebec and parts of eastern Canada.  Power companies were expecting historic levels of energy consumption into Saturday morning during the coldest period. Boston is under a cold emergency. Public schools have been closed in the city, as well as in nearby Worcester and in Buffalo, New York.  New York City - which could see wind chills as low as -10F (-23C) - has enacted an emergency designation that allows the homeless to go to any shelter to seek warmth.  Nor were the Midwestern states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, Illinois and Ohio spared by the freezing temperatures.  Parts of Canada were expecting temperatures as low as -58F. An extreme cold advisory issued by Environment Canada on Friday morning blanketed the Maritimes, most of Quebec and all of Ontario, spilling into Manitoba. In Toronto, the wind chill plunged the temperature to -29C (-20F) on Friday.  Forecasters predict temperatures will rebound by the end of the weekend. The drop in temperatures is attributed to a powerful Arctic front that stretches from the Canadian maritime provinces to the core of the US. The brutal winter weather follows this week's deadly ice storm in parts of Texas, where temperatures have begun to climb above freezing, and ice was expected to melt on Friday. At least 11 people have died in the bad weather in the US south since Monday. There were eight fatalities in Texas, two in Oklahoma and one in Arkansas. More than 250,000 people were still without power as of Friday night in Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and New York, according to poweroutage.us.

Labour politician attacks Plaid co-operation deal,"The Labour Welsh government's co-operation deal with Plaid Cymru has come under attack from the ruling party's backbenches. In a debate on the Welsh government budget, Caerphilly MS Hefin David said it was giving Plaid ""power without responsibility"". Despite agreeing to let the budget pass, Plaid has criticised ministers for not putting income tax up to raise more cash for the NHS. Ministers have rejected the idea. Mr David was one of two Labour MSs to criticise Welsh government policy during the budget debate. Swansea East MS Mike Hedges criticised spending £4.25m on a farm for the company that runs Green Man festival. The comments were made in a debate on the Welsh government's £20bn budget for the next financial year. Meanwhile the Welsh Conservatives called for ministers to do more to fund the ""people's priorities"", and accused Welsh Labour of blaming others for the challenges Wales faces. The budget plans passed on Tuesday evening, with Plaid Cymru abstaining in the vote. A committee earlier said Welsh ministers were not doing enough to help people with the cost-of-living crisis. Signed in 2021, the co-operation agreement sees Labour and Plaid working together on a group of policies, while Plaid allows Labour's budget to pass the Senedd. It is not a coalition deal, and Plaid Cymru have no ministers in the government.  Speaking on Tuesday afternoon, Mr David accused Plaid of wanting to make ""as many uncosted proposals for the current budget as they want to outside of the co-operation agreement"". ""This is where the co-operation agreement is falling down,"" he said. ""It's power without responsibility. ""I think it should either be a coalition government or it should be confidence and supply. What we've got from this deal is Plaid Cymru having the worst of both worlds."" Mr David was later reprimanded for referring in the chamber to Plaid Cymru councillors as being as ""mad as a box of frogs"".  Mr Hedges said he had ""very serious concerns"" about the budget. He called for the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) - which has been at £30 a week since the mid-2000s - to be raised in line with inflation, and for free school meals for all children whose parents are on benefits, and for an end to enterprise zones. ""The priority should be poverty, housing and education,"" he said. He questioned the £4.25m investment by the Welsh government in Gilestone Farm for Green Man festival. ""If people want a tourist attraction, they go to the bank [and] they borrow,"" he said. ""Far too often, the Welsh definition of capitalism is how much money can we get out of the Welsh government."" Plaid Cymru urged MSs to back an amendment to the budget that would add 1p to the basic rate of income tax, 2p to the higher rate and 3p to the top rate.  It says the money raised would fund better wages for NHS staff and social carers. Opening the debate on her budget, Rebecca Evans said the government would not raise taxes while the cost of living was so high. Raising the higher and additional rates of income tax would not raise enough money to make a significant difference, she said. ""The largest contribution would come from the basic rate band taxpayers - and let's be clear that this would impact the lowest paid workers in Wales,"" she said ""The same workers who are seeking help from food banks, the same workers who are having to choose between heating their homes and feeding their families."" The Conservatives said they had an ""action plan"" that would put ""people's priorities"" at the heart of the Welsh government budget, which included care hotels to clear hospital backlogs, surgical hubs and freezing council tax. Peter Fox, Conservative spokesman for finance, told the Senedd there were ""well meaning announcements"" in the budget such as a real living wage for social care and uplifts to teachers pay. ""But we know that councils will be expected to fund the vast majority of these increases,"" he said.  He said the Welsh government could have gone further to reprioritise funding, and questioned spending on £6m on elections policy, £2m on a constitutional commission, or £8m on international relations. ""We now need ministers here... in Wales to start dealing properly with the huge challenges this country is facing and stop looking for other people to blame,"" he said. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the ""choice we face is whether to use the powers that we do have, or simply accept the financial envelope essentially passed to us from Westminster"". Proposing income tax rises, Mr Price said: ""Money alone is not the answer but without it there is no way out of this crisis."" He said those on lower incomes ""stand to suffer most"" from cuts to public services with ""more painful lives"", and accused Welsh ministers of repeating the ""talking points of the Taxpayers Alliance"".  The Welsh Liberal Democrats, who have one MS in the Senedd, called for more money for NHS dentistry and investment in insulation. The draft budget passed 27 votes for and 13 against, with 11 abstentions from Plaid Cymru. Plaid's own proposals for income tax rises failed in a vote, with 11 votes for and 40 against.

Labour politician told off for 'mad as a box of frogs' jibe,"A Labour Senedd member has been reprimanded for referring in the chamber to Plaid Cymru councillors as being as ""mad as a box of frogs"".  Hefin David was talking about the Plaid Cymru group on Caerphilly council. Deputy Presiding Officer David Rees called his words ""wholly inappropriate"", saying ""no member"" should ""be using such language"". Mr David apologised for what he called ""flippant"" and ""inappropriate"" comments made ""in the heat of debate"". The apology by Mr David, Senedd member for Caerphilly, came after Plaid Cymru's Heledd Fychan raised the matter with Mr Rees. He made the jibe during a debate on the Welsh government's spending plans, where where he attached the Welsh government's co-operation deal with Plaid. Ms Fychan said Mr David's comment was ""crass, insensitive and, in a workplace setting, arguably discriminatory"". ""In fact, an employment tribunal judge in 2021 ruled the exact same comments as being inappropriate and unprofessional,"" she said. Ms Fychan said Mr David had ""lowered the tone of the debate"" and used a phrase that was ""an affront to the dignity of the Senedd and the people we represent."" Mr David has twice previously been found to have breached the code of conduct for Senedd members over comments he has made on Twitter.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-64562254
Two French bulldogs die as pet-sitter leaves them in hot car,"A pet-sitter killed two dogs by leaving them in her car in 22°C (72F) heat without water. French bulldogs Lila and Phab were found dead after their owner paid Janine Maloney, 49, to look after them for a weekend. It was the first time Steph Pendleton, 62, had left her ""soul companions"" with anyone.  Cardiff Magistrates' Court heard that Maloney, of Tondu, Bridgend, left the dogs in a car for hours on a sunny day. She has been handed a 16-week suspended prison sentence.  Mrs Pendleton, a retired company director from Bridgend, returned from her boating holiday weekend from 3 to 5 September 2022, to be told both her beloved pets had died after being left with the Pet Patrol Club professional sitter. In written evidence, a vet said they believed Lila and Phab had been ""caused to suffer"" and their needs had ""not been met to the extent required by good practice"". The two dogs died when temperatures outside the car ranged from 16°C at 10:00 GMT to 22°C at 17:00. The prosecuting RSPCA statement said: ""The evidence indicates that the two dogs had been left in the car without any access to water, with none of the car windows open and no air conditioning active."" It added that post-mortem evidence showed evidence of heat stroke or stress in both dogs. ""They were also both overweight, which likely contributed to their susceptibility to heat stress,"" it said. Maloney admitted causing the unnecessary suffering of the two dogs, and failing to meet their needs. As well as her suspended sentence, she was given a 15-day rehabilitation activity requirement and a six-month alcohol programme.  She was also ordered to pay £500 in costs and £500 compensation, and was disqualified from keeping dogs for five years. The court heard she had since closed down the business and said it was a tragic mistake. Mrs Pendleton said: ""I'm tortured by what my girls went through and the death they had. ""Those dogs have only ever known love. I can't imagine. I think about them and how they were probably waiting for me to come and get them while trapped in that car."" Mrs Pendleton said she and her partner Steve had had the dogs since they were just eight weeks old, and her daughters Emma and Beth were particularly fond of them. ""We'd never left them with anyone before, so I really made sure we prepared and tried our best to do our due diligence,"" she said. ""We were going on a boating holiday to west Wales, just for the weekend, but I was worried the dogs wouldn't be comfortable around the water. ""So I found the Pet Patrol Club on Facebook and contacted them. We then had a meet and greet session the week before, so the dogs could get used to it."" Mrs Pendleton said the company sent pictures to the family the day before the dogs died, to reassure them of their care. She added: ""It has been horrendous. I have nightmares about what they would have gone through. I trusted this person."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64561838
Natalie McNally: Two men previously arrested no longer suspects,"Two men, aged 32 and 46, who were previously arrested by detectives investigating the killing of Natalie McNally in Lurgan, have been released unconditionally. Ms McNally, 32, was 15 weeks pregnant when she was stabbed on 18 December at her Silverwood Green home. Police said the men were no longer being considered suspects in the case. Stephen McCullagh, 32, of Woodland Gardens in Lisburn, has been charged with Ms McNally's murder. He appeared via videolink at Lisburn Magistrates' Court on Thursday and was remanded in custody.

Garvaghy Road: More Portadown searches uncover cannabis factory,"A cannabis factory containing drugs with an estimated street value of £32,000 was seized during a search of a house in Portadown on Monday. A 31-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of a number of offences. Police said it was part of an investigation into an organised crime group and followed searches earlier in the day. The properties searched were all in the Garvaghy Road area of the County Armagh town. Nine suspected and replica firearms, three rounds of ammunition, six swords and £6,000, as well as Class A and B controlled drugs were seized in the same area before the cannabis factory was discovered. One man in his 20s who was arrested in relation to the earlier searches has been released on bail pending further inquiries. Police said they had carried out a total of 29 searches and made nine arrests since their investigation began in October. They added that the 31-year-old man arrested on Monday was arrested on suspicion of a number of offences including cultivating cannabis, possession of a Class B drug, possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply and possession of a prohibited weapon, namely pepper spray.

"Gracehill: Unesco status could benefit whole borough, mayor says","Special status for a County Antrim village could bring tourism to the whole area, the mayor of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council has said. Gracehill village, which was founded 264 years ago, has moved a step closer to securing World Heritage Site status. Unesco has been formally asked to consider awarding the cultural title to the village near Ballymena. The application is part of a joint bid with Bethlehem in Pennsylvania in the United States and Herrnhut in Germany. All three sites are Moravian Church Settlements. While life in Gracehill is very different now to what it was in 1759, the church remains a focal point in the square. The picturesque village continues to have an active Moravian Community with its own bishop. ""When you look at it now it's a beautiful quaint little village but in its time it was so modern,"" said the Right Reverend Sarah Groves. ""The first school here was for girls, the buildings were all of a really good standard. People would have wanted to come here."" Many of the traditions have changed, but the Georgian style buildings include the manse, schools and the old Warden's House remain intact. Signposts also show where the Brothers' and Sisters' Walks, on either side of the church, meet at the burial ground, known as God's acre. ""Yes the village was separated in many ways, the single women would have lived together and the single men would have lived together but the Moravians were very keen on marriage and family life,"" Bishop Groves said. ""We sometimes concentrate on the separateness but actually they were very keen on families."" Mayor Noel Williams said the status would benefit Mid and East Antrim by raising the global profile of the borough. He said it would support the economy and have a positive effect on education, quality of life and civic pride. ""The purpose of World Heritage is to help recognise and preserve the named area for present and future generations. Gracehill is an area of our borough that we are very proud of and for that reason we would champion any plans that preserve it,"" he said. David Johnson, chairman of the Gracehill Trust said the submission to Unesco was hugely significant. ""Gracehill has been a good news story for 250 years and for the past 20 years we have been working with international partners to achieve World Heritage status,"" he said. ""We really took a step forward when the United States government came on board and supported their local settlement Bethlehem. That has taken us all forward,"" he added. The Giant's Causeway was designated as a Natural World Heritage site in 1986, but if successful Gracehill would be the first in Northern Ireland to be granted Cultural World Heritage status. ""This would be Northern Ireland's first cultural inscription,"" Mr Johnson said. ""It's quite a high mark to achieve but working with our international partners we're really excited this is something within our grasp."" The Unesco nomination is being led by the United States in conjunction with the German and UK governments. Department for Communities permanent secretary Colum Boyle said the wider community would benefit culturally and economically and getting status would ""further protect an important piece of history for future generations."" UK Arts and Heritage Minister Lord Parkinson said Gracehill offered a fascinating insight into the history of the Moravian Church and its community of worshippers. ""The village of Gracehill would be a worthy recipient of the first cultural Unesco World Heritage Site in Northern Ireland, complementing the natural heritage of the Giant's Causeway and Causeway Coast,"" he said. The transnational nomination will be considered for inscription on the World Heritage List by the Unesco World Heritage Committee next year. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64560110
Dogs: Caerphilly police seize 13 suspected banned animals,"Multiple suspected illegal dogs have been seized by police in one county in five weeks. In an email to Caerphilly councillors, Gwent Police said 13 dogs had been seized since the start of the year. These included a dog and six puppies believed to be pit bulls, one of four breeds which is banned in the UK. Two people were jailed in 2022 after 10-year-old Jack Lis was mauled to death in Penyrheol. That dog, an American or XL bully, was not banned. In December, an 83-year-old woman from nearby Heol Fawr died in hospital after being attacked by a dog. Councillor Lindsay Whittle, who represents Penyrheol, said: ""I would urge any resident to report any dog they fear is a dangerous breed. ""Families in our community have been left devastated by dog attacks so action to reduce the chances of similar incidents is welcomed."" In January, Caerphilly MP Wayne David called on the UK government to toughen the laws on owning dangerous dogs. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was taking the issue seriously and had established a working group to look at the issue, which will make its recommendations later this year.

Alex Salmond says gender row could threaten independence,"Alex Salmond has claimed that Nicola Sturgeon risks damaging the independence movement over her gender  reforms. The former first minister warned his successor against making the issue a ""constitutional battleground"" between Scotland and Westminster. Doing so would create a ""hill to die on"" for Ms Sturgeon, he predicted. Ms Sturgeon has been under pressure following controversy over transgender rapist Isla Bryson.  Bryson - who was known as Adam Graham when the crimes were committed - was initially taken to Cornton Vale women's prison after conviction, but later moved to HMP Edinburgh amid an outcry. The Scottish government's gender recognition reforms would, in effect, allow people to self-identify as a different sex, which critics argue could make it easier for predatory men to access women's spaces.  They have been blocked by Westminster over their potential impact on equalities laws, with the Scottish government saying it will challenge the move in court.  Ms Sturgeon has insisted the reforms are about ""the rights of a minority in our society who already struggle with stigma and discrimination"", and has accused some of her critics of being driven by transphobia, homophobia, misogyny and racism.  Mr Salmond served as SNP first minister during the 2014 independence referendum but is now the leader of the Alba Party. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, he described Ms Sturgeon as being ""one of the ablest communicators in politics"". But he said she had been ""reduced to incoherence"" over the gender reforms, with the idea of allowing people to self-identify their legal sex ""dissolving to dust when it clashes with reality"".  He added: ""If you pass that and you enforce that it does two things. It leaves itself open to bad actors, people of bad faith, like Isla Bryson. ""And secondly, of course, it makes it impossible to enforce the equalities protection of single sex spaces for women. ""You must not make this the constitutional battleground between Scotland and Westminster - if the SNP does that and Nicola Sturgeon continues in that then it will be a hill to die on"". Mr Salmond also said he stood by every word of comments he made at an Alba Party Burns Supper at the weekend, when he described Ms Sturgeon's focus on gender reform as ""daft ideology"" and ""self-indulgent nonsense"".  A YouGov poll published in the Sunday Times at the weekend suggested that support for independence had fallen from 53% to 47% since December, with the popularity of the SNP and the first minister herself also apparently slipping.  A separate poll by Ipsos-Mori released on Tuesday also suggested the first minister's popularity has fallen, with 50% of those asked saying the UK government was right to block the gender reforms and 33% saying it should not have done so.  However, polls consistently indicate that the SNP continues to enjoy a large lead over its rivals.  Mr Salmond warned that if the gender reform issue was allowed to ""run and run"" by Ms Sturgeon challenging Westminster's veto of the legislation in the courts then ""of course it will damage the independence movement"". He urged Ms Sturgeon to seek a resolution with the UK government or to accept the ""sensible amendments"" put forward by some SNP MSPs before the reforms were passed by Holyrood that would have ""rung the sting out of the argument"".  He said a confrontation with Westminster should instead be over ""issues where the Scottish people are absolutely behind their parliament and their government"", such as fuel prices, EU membership or ""Scotland's right to self-determination"".  Ms Sturgeon has consistently refused to say whether she regards Bryson - who only started transitioning from a man to a woman after appearing in court charged with two rapes - as being male or female. When she faced further questions from journalists over the case on Monday, the first minister briefly referred to Bryson as ""her"" before quickly returning to using ""the person"" and ""the individual"". Ms Sturgeon said: ""She regards herself as a woman. I regard the individual as a rapist.  ""What matters is the individual was convicted of rape, and that is what we're talking about here, and that is what I will continue to focus on."" The first minister has previously suggested that Bryson was ""almost certainly"" faking being trans.  Some senior SNP politicians - including Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville and MP Alyn Smith - have suggested that critics of the gender reforms within the party should consider leaving. Ms Sturgeon has appeared to distance herself from their comments, saying that parties should always be willing to deal with policy differences as a matter of ""internal party democracy"". A review of the handling of the Bryson case and the lessons that can be learned from it has been carried out by the prison service but not yet been made public. There is also a wider review within the prison service about how transgender prisoners are dealt with more generally. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-64555543

Oscars: Danielle Deadwyler claims Hollywood is 'deeply impacted by racism',"US actress Danielle Deadwyler has claimed the film industry is ""deeply impacted by systemic racism"", after no black women were nominated for best actress at this year's Oscars. Deadwyler was expected to be recognised for her performance in the drama Till. But she missed out on a nomination, as did Viola Davis, who was also widely tipped to be in the running. Deadwyler said there is a ""trickle-down effect"" of racism in society on many institutions in American life. In Till, the actress plays the mother of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old black boy who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955 after being accused of whistling at a white woman. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, Deadwyler said: ""Cinematic history is 100+ years old. I would dare say the system is deeply, deeply impacted by systemic racism that has shaped our country. ""And if we're still dealing with systemic racism in this country that is leading us to the loss of a Tyre Nichols, that carries us from the loss of Emmett, there is a trickle-down effect of how racism impacts our lives - from the educational system to the film industry to everything, any part of quotidian American life."" Deadwyler was widely praised for her performance in Till, and was considered one of the favourites to be nominated in the leading actress category at this year's Academy Awards. After she was snubbed when the nominations were announced in January, Till writer and director Chinonye Chukwu accused Hollywood of ""unabashed misogyny towards Black women"". Asked about those comments, Deadwyler told Radio 4: ""Yes there is value to what [Chukwu] said, and it's imperative that every quality of our life begin to truly, deeply interrogate and shift and rupture and radically shift the way they seek to actually be an equitable institution."" Asked whether the Oscars or wider society needs to change, Deadwyler replied: ""It's from both ends... It's got to come from every angle."" The Academy has increased the number of female and black and ethnic minority voters since the #OscarsSoWhite outcry in 2015. Deadwyler noted that very few black women had been recognised at the Oscars, and there were often ""numerous decades in between"" those who had. She referred to Hattie McDaniel's supporting actress win in 1940 and Halle Berry's leading actress win in 2002, which remains the only victory in that category for a black woman. ""You have to begin to question why there are these gaps,"" Deadwyler said. ""Before I was even in consideration for anything, these are the things that I witnessed.  ""So these are critical questions of, how do you begin to actually bring equity to spaces which have long been led or deeply impacted by white supremacy, ideologies, thoughts and practises?"" This year's best actress nominees are Michelle Yeoh, Cate Blanchett, Ana De Armas, Michelle Williams and Andrea Riseborough. British actress Riseborough scored a shock nomination following a campaign driven by a number of Hollywood A-listers. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences conducted a review into the campaign and said some tactics ""caused concern"", but her nomination was not revoked. Williams was recognised despite a debate in Hollywood over whether she should have been nominated in the supporting actress category. No black men are nominated for best lead actor this year. Two black performers - Angela Bassett and Brian Tyree Henry - are in the running in the supporting categories. The winners will be announced on 12 March.

"Eurovision: Volunteer roles look and smell like a job, unions claim","Trade unions have raised concerns with Liverpool City Council over the role volunteers will play when the city hosts the Eurovision contest in May. The council wants more than 500 people to help in unpaid roles that range from greeting artists to scanning tickets and giving travel advice. The authority said volunteering was a chance ""to meet new people, gain skills and make great memories"". However, unions said the roles on offer sounded more akin to paid jobs. The volunteers will help deliver about two weeks of music, entertainment and art in the city, as well as the semi-finals and grand final at the waterfront arena and fan park. A description on the council's website stated it would be ""a rewarding experience to feel part of a team and to have contributed to an event that will be talked about for decades"". ""Volunteering is an opportunity to meet new people, gain skills and make great memories,"" it added. However, Trades Union Congress (TUC) regional secretary Jay McKenna told BBC Radio Merseyside that after seeing the roles advertised, unions were concerned that people were ""being asked for various requirements, including a minimum number of shifts they ought to be available, not being paid [and] not being recompensed for travel costs"". ""Some of these roles appear to amount to what we would see as paid work and that raises questions,"" he said.  ""I can't think that anyone attending any major event like Eurovision would expect anyone scanning their tickets wouldn't be getting paid for that work.   ""One of the [other] jobs is cleaning and replenishing riders in the dressing rooms. ""So, those musicians will take to the stage but you'll be involved in cleaning their dressing rooms and maybe even providing them with food and drink and not being paid for that."" Mr McKenna said the big question he would ask the council was ""are there more people being paid to do that work than there are volunteers?"" ""If there are paid cleaners and a team of staff that will be doing the ticket scanning and so on supported by volunteers then that is something we'd expect. ""If they are doing that work and there isn't a team of paid cleaners... it looks like we are asking volunteers to do that work, and that jars with us. ""Volunteering has a role in society but in a cost-of-living crisis, we are asking people to do roles and responsibilities in what looks like and smells like a job. ""Having these events is really important, but it shouldn't be to the financial detriment  of those who are required to make it happen.""  The unions have arranged to meet the council to discuss their concerns. Harry Doyle, the authority's cabinet member for culture, said ""when it comes to large scale events we always have volunteers or ambassadors as I like to call them"".  ""We've already had 1,500 people apply so you can see the sheer scale of excitement of people wanting to get involved.  ""These are fans who want to have that access to delegations and they just want to have all the perks that come with being involved."" He said the role descriptions were ""no different to what we've done before or whatever other cities have done before"". ""We are meeting the trade unions and will discuss their concerns,"" he said. ""We want to make sure that we can work closely and be an exemplar.  ""Volunteers will be the face of Eurovision and welcome people to our city."" He added that Eurovision would also act as a springboard for people to find well-paid jobs in hospitality.

Nurses in Devon and Cornwall join national strike again,"Nurses in the South West have walked out again to join what has been described as the biggest round of strikes in NHS history. There were picket lines at Torbay, Derriford, Royal Devon, North Devon and Royal Cornwall hospitals on Tuesday. One striker asked the public to ""bear with us and understand"" their fight for better pay, staffing and patient care.  Health Secretary Steve Barclay warned the walkouts would ""undoubtedly have an impact on patients and cause delays"". He said ministers had met the recommendations of the independent NHS Pay Review Body. RCN members are striking in a third of England's NHS trusts.  Vicky Webb, a clinical practitioner at Plymouth's Derriford Hospital, said better pay was ""absolutely fundamental"" to recruitment and retention of staff.  ""Just bear with us and please understand where we are coming from,"" she said. ""We are not necessarily doing this just for us and our colleagues; this is about safer staffing on the wards and achieving better care for our patients. ""Operations are already cancelled on a daily basis. We are already a workforce in crisis."" She called on the government to ""follow the precedent"" set in Scotland and Wales, where pay deals have been reached. NHS Providers chief Sir Julian Hartley has urged the government to re-open talks with unions, but ministers ruled out reopening this year's pay award, worth an extra 4.75% on average, and instead have urged unions to start discussing next year's deal.  All 14 health unions have pulled out of that process. Stuart Quarterman, RCN steward and a registered nurse, said he hoped the government would ""start to engage"". ""We're on the coalface. We can see how much people believe in what we are doing,"" he said. Surgical specialist nurse Shaji Devadasan said the striking staff should be ""inside the hospital, caring for patients"" and that strike action would end if the government made a deal.  Cancer nurse Harriet Halfhead, picketing the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro, said: ""You've got to fight for what you believe in and if we just roll over and give up then it will never get better."" Fellow nurse Roisin Macsweeney said: ""I do think the public do support us and it is about them; it's about their health, their wellbeing and doing what we can to protect people who are vulnerable and can't speak up for themselves.""

London mayor urges people to give blood and save lives,"The mayor of London has donated blood as part of a drive to save lives. At least 40,000 new donors are needed in the capital each year over the next five years to keep supplying blood for lifesaving treatments, according to the NHS. There is a particular focus on increasing the number of Black, Asian and minority ethnic donors, who make up fewer than 5% of national donors. Sadiq Khan said donating blood was ""an easy way to be a hero"". ""Often people don't think about the fact that the blood must come from somewhere,"" he added. Also at the City Hall event was Dr Amos Ogunkoya, from BBC One's The Traitors, who donated blood for the first time. Blood donations are particularly important for those who have sickle cell - the fastest-growing genetic condition in the UK - which causes red blood cells to distort and become sticky, blocking vessels and restricting oxygen supply. The condition mostly affects people of Black heritage and ethnically-matched blood gives the best treatment. Each month in the UK, 1,300 donors of Black heritage are needed to give blood to help provide transfusions to sickle cell patients, as well as for use in emergencies, childbirth, during surgery and in cancer treatments, the NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) service said. The rare blood type Ro is also most often needed by patients with sickle cell, with Black heritage donors 10 times more likely to have the Ro subtype. Last year, hospitals in London asked for 58% more Ro blood than they did five years ago, and the city has the highest number of sickle cell patients in the UK, according to the NHS. Calvin Campbell, who has sickle cell, receives 10 to 11 units of blood every three to four weeks.  ""It takes 120 people a year to keep me alive,"" he said.  Mr Campbell added ""historical mistrust of the NHS"" was one of the reasons stopping people of Black heritage from donating blood. He said he understood people's concerns, but called blood donation ""the most important gift"" for people like him. David Rose, director of donor experience at NHSBT, said the service was only able to provide matched blood for about half of the hospital requests for Ro blood. ""As one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the world, Londoners have the unique opportunity to be part of the solution by becoming donors,"" he said.  There are currently around 108,000 donors in the capital city. Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Queen Elizabeth Prize: Solar team wins prestigious engineering award,"Four pioneers behind the electricity-generating silicon solar cell have won this year's Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering. Martin Green, Andrew Blakers, Jianhua Zhao and Aihua Wang developed so-called Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell, or Perc, technology. This transformed the efficiency of solar panels and is now built into 90% of all installations worldwide. The team is to be honoured at a special ceremony later in the year. The quartet will share a £500,000 award and a trophy, to be presented by the Princess Royal. ""Our winners did something wonderful, which was to increase the efficiency with which a solar cell converts light into electricity, and it was a really quite dramatic change,"" explained Lord Browne of Madingley, chairman of the QE Prize for Engineering Foundation. ""With their breakthrough we went from around 16-18% efficiency to something like 26%. That's a big jump,"" he told BBC News. Today, solar uptake is rocketing as the world tries to move away from fossil fuels. Some estimates suggest that by the 2030s, solar will have more installed capacity than coal, oil, gas, nuclear and hydro put together.   Previous QE Prize winners When Australian Martin Green started investigating solar energy following the oil crisis of the 1970s, solar cells were used largely just on satellites in space. If you'd wanted to put that technology on your roof, it would have cost much more than your house. But Prof Green's persistence kicked off a revolution. And with Drs Blakers, Zhao and Wang in his University of New South Wales laboratory, the team not only managed to drive up efficiency but do it in a way that became relatively straightforward to manufacture. In a solar cell, photons - or particles of light - strike silicon atoms to free electrons and set up a current. Perc technology boosted performance by remodelling the rear of the cell to reduce the ability of electrons to recombine with atoms. It also kept many more photons in play. Dr Blakers recalled: ""Traditionally, the rear surface just had a layer of metal aluminium printed directly into it, and so that wasn't a very good reflector of light. And it also gobbled up any electron that went anywhere near the back surface.  ""Replacing that crude back metal contact with a more sophisticated contact served both purposes and led to quite significant increases in cell efficiency."" The right properties for the rear surface were found in materials such as silicon dioxide, aluminium oxide and silicon nitride. Industry started to pick up the Perc approach in 2012, and by 2018 it had become utterly dominant, with China positioning itself as the home of global production. Extraordinarily, one out of every seven panels produced worldwide is now manufactured by a single Chinese facility, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The country's supremacy can be laid directly at the feet of Drs Zhao and Wang and other Chinese students who studied in Prof Green's lab and then returned home to initiate manufacturing.  ""We were among the first to start Perc production,"" said Dr Zhao. ""There are two provinces that do most of the manufacturing today. China dominates because of cost; it's so much cheaper to produce solar panels there,"" added Dr Wang.   Commercial cells typically have efficiencies - the amount of electrical energy that can be extracted from the input of sunlight - of 22-23%. The theoretical upper-limit is about 29%. Prof Green is experimenting with ""cell modules"" in which materials are stacked on top of silicon and customised to collect the photons in the sunlight spectrum that might ordinarily be lost in a standard set-up. ""We hold the world record for efficiency in a cell module of 40.6%,"" he told BBC News. ""But it's hard to see how this approach can be made cheap enough for commercial production. There's a lot of interest right now in a material called perovskite - a common mineral - but the cells use heavy elements, like lead. The cells also aren't as stable as silicon."" Demand for solar energy is growing around the world, with global economies increasingly recognising its benefits. The IEA estimates global solar PV capacity will almost triple over the 2022-2027 period, becoming the largest source of power capacity in the world.   Currently, solar is providing about half of new-build electricity generation capacity worldwide.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-64553915
"Jolene Bunting asked Paul Golding to cover £545 penalty, watchdog hears","Details of a financial dispute between a former Belfast City councillor and Britain First have emerged during an adjudication hearing of NI's local government watchdog.  Jolene Bunting is being investigated by the Local Government Commissioner for Standards. It follows a complaint from Paul Golding, the leader of Britain First. Mr Golding alleges Ms Bunting asked him to cover the cost of a £545 penalty she received from the council in 2018. It followed a stunt at City Hall with Britain First's then deputy leader Jayda Fransen. However, the adjudication heard that while Ms Bunting did have £545 deducted from her monthly council allowance, the deduction was because she had exceeded the contracted data usage on her council mobile phone - not because of Britain First.  Ms Bunting, a former independent unionist councillor who declined to participate in the hearing, denies that she asked Mr Golding for money because of the stunt in City Hall.  The adjudication heard that Ms Bunting previously told investigators that she believed Mr Golding was sending her money because she had agreed to let Britain First use her home address as a PO box.  Mr Golding disputed this.  He told the hearing that Ms Bunting had phoned him in June 2018 informing him that she had been fined by the council ""as a punishment for when Jayda Fransen sat in the lord mayor's chair in January"". He added: ""She said: 'I can't afford to pay that'.  ""I said: 'Don't worry, this was a Britain First publicity stunt' and we would pay it."" Mr Golding told the hearing that he informed Ms Bunting that he would need proof of the penalty for his records and that she sent him a copy of her payslip. He said he decided to pay her in instalments, sending her £50 and then £65.  It was later, following a falling out with Ms Bunting, that he had been prompted to look again at the payslip.  ""And that's when I realised we'd been had,"" he told the hearing.  Mr Golding said the slip that he was sent appeared to have been ""tampered with"" to omit the reason for the deduction, which was stated on the original payslip as ""member's phone repayments"".  In an earlier interview with the watchdog, Ms Bunting denied that she had altered the payslip. The assistant commissioner for standards is to consider whether or not Ms Bunting breached the council's code of conduct in the matter.  The hearing continues.

Turkey earthquake: Newcastle community's anxious wait for news,"The north-east of England's Turkish community is desperately trying to contact relatives caught in Monday's earthquake. More than 7,000 people are known to have been killed in southern Turkey and northern Syria as the  7.8 magnitude quake hit near the city of Gaziantep. There is now an urgent appeal to help survivors facing freezing temperatures. Yunus Kandemir, who lives in Newcastle, said family members he had reached had called it ""the end of the world"". His sister and parents, who live in the city of Adiyaman, two hours north-east of Gaziantep, had been sleeping outside after their home was destroyed. He has not heard from other aunts and uncles. ""We don't know what happened to them,"" he said. His brother Eyyup Kandemir said there were ""a lot of people under the buildings, you know, waiting for help"". Yilmaz Karakus, who also lives in Newcastle, said his family had survived the earthquake but communication was difficult. ""Some families, we haven't [reached],"" he said. ""We've got some family from mum's side, they live in the village, there is still a lot of people they cannot [reach] them, because of the roads."" Sahin Gulmen, chairman of the Newcastle Turkish Centre, said ""physically you can't do anything"" but the 1,800-strong Turkish community in the region was trying to help with donations of money and warm clothes. Durham University disaster recovery expert Prof Lucy Easthope, author of the Sunday Times bestselling book When The Dust Settles, said the ""scale of devastation"" was apparent. ""The eyes of the world will be on it for such a fleeting amount of time but, for the recovery, this is a very long response,"" she said. ""It's also looking like a very expensive response. ""Just the cost of the humanitarian effort... this is huge."" Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Send your story ideas to northeastandcumbria@bbc.co.uk.

Presbyterian Church: Dublin minister Sam Mawhinney next moderator,"A minister from the Republic of Ireland has been chosen as leader of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland for the first time in almost a quarter of a century.  The Rev Sam Mawhinney, from Dublin, was elected to the most the senior position within the church, known as moderator.  He is minister of Adelaide Road Presbyterian Church in Dublin. The Rev Trevor Morrow of Lucan Presbyterian Church was the last moderator from the republic.  He was elected in 2000. The moderator serves for one year, starting in June, and the Rev John Kirkpatrick from Portrush Presbyterian is currently in the role. Presbyterians voted between Dr Mawhinney from Dublin and the Rev Richard Murray from County Antrim. Dr Mawhinney became moderator by 10 votes to nine. Since Ireland was partitioned in 1921 only nine moderators have been from south of the border. Mr Murray is the minister of Drumreagh Presbyterian Church, near Ballymoney. His father-in-law, the late Rev Dr David McGaughey, was moderator of the church in 1994-95. It is rare for only two nominees to go forward for election - there are normally more. The last time there were only two was 10 years ago. The church has 19 regional presbyteries and each will meet on Tuesday evening to choose between the nominees.

Microsoft unveils new Bing with ChatGPT powers,"Microsoft has announced a new version of its search engine Bing, which incorporates the latest in artificial intelligence. The overhaul deploys Open AI's Chat GPT technology, which has taken the world by storm since its launch last year. The move is by far the biggest threat Google has seen to its dominance in web search - and marks the beginning of an AI arms race between the companies. ""The race starts today,"" Microsoft boss Satya Nadella said.  Developed by San Francisco-based OpenAI, Chat GPT uses deep learning techniques to generate human-like responses to search requests. The latest version of Bing responds to search queries with more detailed answers - not just links to websites.  Users are also able to chat with the bot to better tailor their queries. More contextual answers will be added on the right hand side of a search page. The new Bing search engine will be live right away - with a limited number of searches for each person.  The announcement comes a day after Google revealed details of its own new chatbot, Bard. Both companies are scrambling to get their products to market.  In a note to investors after the announcement, analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said he thought that Microsoft's investment would ""massively boost"" the firm's ability to compete. ""This is just the first step on the AI front ... as [the] AI arms race takes place among Big Tech,"" he said.  Since Microsoft unveiled the technology on 30 November, the speed of developments have hugely accelerated. Microsoft, an early backer of the company, last month announced it was extending its collaboration with OpenAI in a ""multiyear, multibillion dollar investment"". Microsoft said Bing will use OpenAI technology that is even more advanced than the ChatGPT technology unveiled last year.  It has also announced a new premium tier of Microsoft Teams - its messaging software - that will feature ChatGPT, including a feature that automatically generates notes and highlights of meetings.  Analysts say ChatGPT - which has been used by students to pass exams and tests - has the potential to be incredibly disruptive to multiple professions, including journalism.  But it has been criticised for confidently giving answers that are wrong. It also works on datasets that are generally scraped from 2021 or earlier - so many of its answers can feel outdated.

Turkey earthquake: Welsh rescue team told to stand down,"Rescuers ready to travel to Turkey and Syria have been left feeling ""sick"" after being told to stand down. Dog handlers Emma Whittle and Brian Jones were expecting to travel with a detection dog team to help after the earthquake. The death toll currently stands at more than 7,200. Ms Whittle and Mr Jones had hoped they would be able to help rescue survivors from the rubble with their specialist search dogs. Mr Jones, of British International Rescue and Search Dogs (BIRSD), which is based in Penmaenmawr, Conwy county, said he felt ""very sick because every little helps"". He said dogs could help pinpoint areas where people might be trapped. ""Instead of 30 yards square, it may be five yard square and we know there's a scent coming out of the rubble in that area,"" he explained. ""So we know we can mark that area for Serve On to come and extract the body."" Serve On are a humanitarian crisis organisation that works at home and abroad. Mr Jones said a team had been sent out by the UK government on Monday.  He said: ""I think they had four dogs with them. We asked if they needed our services, they said 'yes, thank you for offering'. ""We were then put on standby by Serve On. During the night we sat there. ""In the morning we got a notification from Serve On that they had been stood down and couldn't get into the country. ""The problem is between our government and the Syrian government. They couldn't get permission to go out there."" Ms Whittle has not worked in the aftermath of an earthquake before but was called in to help after a landslide in Malaysia. ""Time is of the essence, the sooner we get out there the better,"" she said. The disaster happened when a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Gaziantep, Turkey, early on Monday morning.  This was followed by 7.5 magnitude tremor which had its epicentre in Elbistan in the south of the country.  On Monday, 76 rescue specialists were sent by the UK government to help with the search for survivors.  The Welsh Institute for International Affairs and Syrian Welsh Society is asking people to donate to organisations on the ground. Mohammed Alhadj Ali, from the Syrian Welsh Society, said the situation was ""catastrophic"". He said: ""They need medical aid, they need shelters, help and support to get people out of rooms. ""That's the highest priority to be honest with you."" Dr Ali said friends had told him winter in Syria had been difficult.  There was no fuel for heating, he said, food was in short supply and prices were rising. ""They had airstrikes, they had the bombardments, the floods, tough winters and difficult summers,"" he said. ""It's been a decade of tragedy in Syria."" Wales' Social Justice Minister Jane Hutt said she had seen a message of sympathy to the Turkish ambassador. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64553883
Memphis investigating seven more officers in Tyre Nichols case,"Memphis is investigating seven more officers in the case of Tyre Nichols, and attorney for the city has said.  In total, 13 police officers could be disciplined for ""policy violations"", Jennifer Sink told Memphis City Council on Tuesday.  She declined to name the officers currently being investigated, saying the probe was not complete.  Mr Nichols, 29, died several days after being beaten by members of the Memphis police force following a traffic stop.  His death has renewed nationwide calls for police reform and his family will be in attendance at President Joe Biden's State of the Union address on Tuesday night in Washington DC.  The president is expected to push for reforms in the televised speech.  To date, seven police officers have been relieved of duty in connection to the death of Mr Nichols, who was black, including six who were fired and one unnamed officer who was suspended.  Five of the officers fired - all of whom are black -  have been charged with his murder. Three emergency medical workers have also been fired for not providing Mr Nichols adequate care.  In a written statement to the BBC on Tuesday, Ms Sink said that an administrative investigation is underway for the additional officers to ""determine if City policies were violated and what disciplinary action should be taken"".  The ""information is subject to change"", she said, and Memphis officials expect to share more information next week after hearings have been held. Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn Davis told the city council that Memphis is ""still adding names to the list"" of officers charged in the incident.  She said around 10 police officers responded to the 7 January traffic stop. Video footage of the encounter released two weeks ago shows police using a taser, pepper-spraying, and hitting Mr Nichols.  The meeting, which focused on reforms in the wake of his death, was the first held since that footage was released to the public. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64557997
Zoom cuts 15% of staff in post-pandemic 'reset',"Zoom, the video conferencing company that became a household name when remote work spiked during the Covid pandemic, is laying off 1,300 staff. The move affects about 15% of its workforce, which has seen user growth slow and profits fall recently. Boss Eric Yuan said he and other leaders would also take big pay cuts, as the company focuses on making sure it can weather the slowdown.  It is joining a large number of other tech firms making similar adjustments. ""As the world transitions to life post-pandemic, we are seeing that people and businesses continue to rely on Zoom,"" Mr Yuan wrote in a message to employees shared by the company.  ""But the uncertainty of the global economy, and its effect on our customers, means we need to take a hard - yet important - look inward to reset ourselves so we can weather the economic environment, deliver for our customers and achieve Zoom's long-term vision."" Amazon and Salesforce are among the other heavyweights to have announced big job cuts, saying the boom in business they saw during the pandemic was ending.  More than 300 tech firms have laid off nearly 100,000 workers globally since the start of the year, according to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks such announcements.  Zoom especially has faced challenges as rival tech firms upgrade their video offerings.  The firm's revenue more than tripled in 2020 and grew about 55% in 2021. But last year, the gains slowed to the single digits and its profits dropped sharply.  Shares in the company have plunged more than 80% from their 2020 peak. Mr Yuan said the cuts would affect every part of the organisation and were aimed at reducing duplicative roles and refocusing on the firm's top priorities. Affected staff will receive 16 weeks of salary and health care coverage, among other support.  Mr Yuan said he would also reduce his salary in the coming fiscal year by 98% and forego his bonus. Other members of the executive leadership team will see their base salaries fall by 20% and lose bonuses, he added.  ""We worked tirelessly.. but we also made mistakes. We didn't take as much time as we should have to thoroughly analyze our teams or assess if we were growing sustainably, toward the highest priorities,"" Mr Yuan said. ""As the CEO and founder of Zoom, I am accountable for these mistakes and the actions we take today - and I want to show accountability not just in words but in my own actions."" Shares in the firm jumped more than 8% following the announcement.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64562673
Relics of zero-Covid dot China as life moves on,"China has ditched zero-Covid but remnants of the policy are still everywhere - from sprawling temporary hospitals and empty testing booths, to posters of QR codes that ask for your travel history.  Streets and malls are busy again after officials announced the end of the current wave, sparked by the sudden reversal of three-year-long restrictions. There is no public record of how much China invested in what became a signature policy of leader Xi Jinping. But according to a Reuters estimate last year, Beijing was on track to spend more than 350 billion yuan ($52bn; £43bn) on Covid testing, new medical facilities, monitoring equipment and other anti-Covid measures in 2022.  And now much of that infrastructure is being dismantled or repurposed - or at least that's what officials are trying to do.  In Shandong province, they recently turned a makeshift hospital - which appears to be built from metal containers - into a rental space. It offers discounted apartments to ""skilled talents"", although it's unclear who qualifies for this.  This is despite local media reporting in only December - just before zero-Covid was dropped - that Shandong's local government was planning to spend 23bn yuan on building makeshift hospitals.  This particular 605-room facility, located in the provincial capital Jinan, was being used as a quarantine centre. One tenant, who works at a carmaker nearby, told Jinan Daily that he ""literally moved in with his suitcase"", adding it was ""very convenient"" as his workplace was just across the street. The government has portrayed this as a cost-saving win. Many people commenting online support it too, suggesting it as a housing option for migrant workers. Others, however, question how comfortable this ""square cabin"" would be in winter, especially as it was built within a month last year. ""I suggest the person who came up with the idea go and live in the square cabin,"" one user on Weibo mocked. On Douyin - the Chinese version of TikTok - a top-liked comment read: ""This will surely scare the talents away."" But that's not all that remains as an inescapable reminder of life under zero-Covid.  Testing booths, both mobile and stationary, had been a common sight across the country. Located in every neighbourhood, they played an essential role in implementing zero-Covid.  Now some of these booths are up for sale - from 500-8,000 yuan - on second-hand trading platforms. Many more are still on the streets, sitting empty and no longer in use.  Queues at these sites were common at the peak of restrictions as some places required people to test every day. Often people had to have a negative result for permission to use the bus or buy groceries.  Tape and barricades also frequently seen - to section off parts of streets for testing booths, queues or other Covid-related measures. Many of these remain visible too. While most testing requirements are gone, bright red posters asking people to scan QR codes can still be spotted everywhere. Under zero-Covid, anyone entering shops or restaurants was required to scan these codes, which revealed their travel history, whether or not they had Covid, or whether they had been in contact with someone who had tested positive.  In some cases the signs are stuck on to restaurants and shopfronts that have long shut.  Zero-Covid hit China's economy hard, strangling supply chains and shuttering businesses, from economic hub Shanghai to rural towns.  But the one thing that is no longer visible is the hundreds of thousands of workers in white hazmat suits who carried out Beijing's zero-Covid edicts.  There has never been an official tally of their number, and it seems like authorities have given little guidance on where they could work next.

New Zealand pilot taken hostage by separatists in Indonesia,"A New Zealand pilot has been taken hostage by separatist fighters in Indonesia's Papua region who have threatened to kill him.  The man was taken after his plane was set alight when it landed in the mountainous district of Nduga. Five passengers who were on board, including a young child, are thought to have been released. The separatists want Indonesia to recognise the independence of the province of West Papua. Police have said they are investigating the incident - but say this is logistically difficult as the area can only be reached by air.  The pilot has been named as Philip Merthens, although different spellings for his name have been given.  The West Papua National Liberation Army - which Indonesia has designated as a terrorist group - has claimed responsibility for the attack.  The group's spokesperson, Sebby Sambom, has said the pilot will be executed if Indonesia ""is obstinate"" and fails to negotiate over the independence of West Papua. The New Zealand government has said that it is aware of the situation and its consulate in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, is providing assistance to the pilot's family.  The plane, which belonged to Susi Air, was carrying supplies from the mining town of Timika in the neighbouring district, according to the Associated Press.  The airline's founder, Susie Pudjiastuti, has said on social media that she is praying for those who were captured.  The Papua region is a former Dutch colony that is divided into two provinces, Papua and West Papua.  It was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969 following a disputed UN-supervised ballot and since then fighting between separatists and the Indonesian military has become common. Papua is separate to Papua New Guinea, which was given independence by Australia in 1975.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64562315
State of the Union 2023: Who is the designated survivor?,"When US President Joe Biden steps onto the dais in the US Capitol for his State of the Union address on Tuesday, a ""who's who"" of Washington power players - lawmakers, Supreme Court Justices and top military brass - will be just feet away. But one player will be notably absent - the so-called ""designated survivor"" tasked with taking charge in the event an unforeseen tragedy wipes out or incapacitates the rest of the government officials gathered for the speech.  The identity of the night's designated survivor is a closely held secret until after the event. Last year, it was Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.  According to the non-profit National Constitution Center, the tradition began in the 1950s, when the spectre of a possible nuclear war between the US and the Soviet Union loomed in the early Cold War.  It was only in 1981 that the US government first publicly identified the designated survivor. That year, it was Terrel Bell, then President Ronald Reagan's secretary of education.  Since then, designated survivors have been chosen from a range of government agencies, including the attorney general in the justice department, and a number of cabinet-level secretaries.  Under former President Donald Trump, the State of the Union designated survivors were the secretaries of agriculture, energy and the interior.  For the traditional presidential address to a joint session of Congress that followed his election, Mr Trump's designated survivor was Secretary of Veteran Affairs David Shulkin.  Designated survivors must be eligible for the presidency to be named to the position and will only take on the role of commander in chief if every higher-ranking official in the line of succession is incapacitated. Eligibility requirements demand the person must have been born a US citizen, meaning naturalised citizens like current Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm cannot take on the position.  The role has also been thrust into the public consciousness in part by Hollywood.  Designated Survivor, a TV show, has actor Kiefer Sunderland playing the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and taking the helm of the US government after an explosion destroys the Capitol during the State of the Union. The reality, however, is far more mundane. Last year, Ms Raimondo watched the speech from a secure location, but otherwise had a normal day. In a 2017 Politico essay, one of Bill Clinton's designated survivors, former agriculture secretary Dan Glickman, recalled spending the State of the Union at his daughter's apartment in New York, alongside a military officer carrying the codes necessary to launch the US nuclear arsenal.  ""I sometimes wonder if I would have had the courage to give the order,"" he wrote.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64563185
Turkey earthquake: What are UK charities doing to help?,"Aid is being stepped up in southern Turkey and northern Syria, after a huge earthquake devastated the region, leaving more than 7,000 people dead. The 7.8 magnitude quake struck near Gaziantep, Turkey in the early hours of Monday, reducing blocks of flats to rubble at a time when most were asleep. It is a region where there has not been a major earthquake for more than 200 years, or any warning signs. National governments of many countries including the UK, the US, China and Russia are providing aid, including search and rescue experts. And many charities are also launching appeals and sending teams to the area.  The British Red Cross was one of the first major UK charities to launch its appeal. It is working in conjunction with the Turkish Red Crescent and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, and is already on the ground ""providing urgent support during these critical hours"" and evacuating people to safety. Many of those injured have lost their homes and all their possessions, surviving in freezing conditions or rain with little shelter or food. Oxfam is another large charity to have launched an appeal.  It said it would focus on providing ""protection, water and sanitation, shelter and food"", while also assessing the longer-term needs of people in the aftermath of so much destruction. Its spokesperson in Ankara, Meryem Aslan, said local people were ""shell-shocked"" and struggling to cope ""following two big earthquakes and over 60 aftershocks"". ""The scale of destruction is vast. People are still in shock and fear, they don't even have time to mourn the lost ones,"" she said. Turkish and Syrian communities in the UK - many searching for information about missing loved ones - have launched their own local donation drives - many using Facebook to reach volunteers and donors. A spokesman for the British Turkish Association, based in Luton, said the reaction of ""all communities"" in London had been ""emotional"". Atilla Ustun, 55, also a chairman of the Luton-Turkish Community Association, spoke to the PA news agency from Heathrow as he helped load a Turkish Airlines cargo plane with more than 300 boxes of donated clothing, medical supplies and aid for babies. ""All the communities in Luton and around have swarmed to donate... Just locally, in Luton itself, we've raised around £20,000,"" he said, ""but we know that in general, I think in London it's now between £200,000 and 300,000."" Ali Topaloglu, from the Nottingham Turkish Community, is part of a campaign asking for donations of tents, blankets and clothes for Turkey, as well as money for food parcels. The region hit by the earthquake is home to millions of refugees displaced by the Syrian civil war, with northern areas still embroiled in conflict. It was already a major hub for NGOs (non-governmental organisations) and charities - many of whom have been there for years, as part of cross-border support for those displaced by war. Organisations including Save the Children, Unicef and Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) have all launched appeals following the earthquake. MSF provided immediate support to 23 healthcare facilities across Idlib and Aleppo in north-west Syria, where hospitals and clinics are ""overwhelmed"" and access to the war-torn region for external medical personnel can be difficult. The charity is providing emergency medical kits and staff to reinforce local healthcare teams who are ""working around the clock to respond to the huge numbers of wounded"". ""The needs are very high in north-west Syria as this quake adds a dramatic layer for the vulnerable populations that are still struggling after many years of war"", said Sebastien Gay, head of MSF in Syria.  Save the Children said it had spent a lot of time so far checking on needs, and what was working logistically. James Denselow, UK head of conflict and humanitarian advocacy, said: ""Providing shelter is the most urgent type of aid from our perspective, because the cold will kill people in ways that are less spectacular than the earthquake, but equally deadly."" He said with airports out of action and hospitals and clinics collapsed, ""all the sort of places we would normally use are not necessarily accessible"". He added the aid route to northern Syria remained inadequate. ""Northern Syria is an area where we were dealing with severe malnutrition and far more huge humanitarian needs than in other environments before this happened,"" he said. ""If you're a vulnerable population and then something else like this happens on top of that, obviously what happens to you is likely going to be far worse. ""We see that with very basic things like children's physiology. The ability of a child to survive crash injury from a building falling on them is far reduced if they are malnourished."" He added: ""This is going to be about getting blankets, food, clean water, education kits - so children don't find their studies completely devastated by this - to them. ""We need to keep those people warm, we need to keep young infants warm."" David Wightwick, CEO of medical aid charity UK-Med, said his team were heading to Turkey to assess where their help was most needed, before mobilising their register of hundreds of NHS medics. ""You can imagine in an area the size affected and with the numbers affected that's not necessarily an easy decision to make,"" he told BBC Radio 4 Today programme. Typically, the larger humanitarian organisations do not ask for donations of blankets or clothes - but prefer money. ""What people give today might not be what people need tomorrow,"" states Oxfam, highlighting the delays in aid reaching victims because of shipping times from the UK. ""Our approach is to work with local organisations and communities on the ground, rather than sending blankets, clothes and other donated goods from the UK"", the charity's humanitarian lead Magnus Corfixen said. ""In emergencies, we often do cash distributions because it's quicker, allows people to get what they most need and also helps the local economy to recover. From our years of experience, we have found that as well as giving people choices, cash also helps to preserve their dignity."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64554165
State of the Union: Biden to tout economic record in primetime speech,"US President Joe Biden is expected to tout his administration's record on the economy when he gives an optimistic State of the Union address on Tuesday. He will speak to a full, politically divided Congress and make the case for his leadership in the primetime speech. It is being viewed as a blueprint for a potential re-election bid in 2024, which he is expected to announce soon. But it comes as Mr Biden's public approval rating hovers near the lowest level of his presidency. He will likely lay out his administration's achievements and agenda over the past year, focusing on recent strong employment figures and falling inflation. Mr Biden, 80, will deliver the hour-long address to a full House chamber featuring high-profile guests and nearly every senior member of government. He will cover a range of issues, including the economic recovery after the coronavirus pandemic, the war in Ukraine and police reform following the death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis last month. He will also challenge Republicans, who have a new majority in the House, to raise taxes on the wealthy and increase social aid. Republican Kevin McCarthy, who leads the party in the chamber, reportedly called on his colleagues to behave during the address. The ""cameras are on,"" and the ""mics are hot"", he said during a closed-door meeting. Mr Biden will speak in front a large television audience at 21:00 eastern time (02:00 GMT). ""I want to talk to the American people and let them know the state of affairs,"" he said on Monday. ""Just have a conversation with the American people."" ""This is a president who is incredibly optimistic,"" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. But the address has been complicated by escalating tensions with China over the shooting down of a suspected surveillance balloon at the weekend. Mr Biden has been criticised by Republicans for not ordering the object to be destroyed sooner. A new poll by the BBC's US partner CBS showed 39% of Americans approved of the administration's general China policy. Another recent poll by the Associated Press showed just a quarter of US adults felt the country was heading in the right direction, with many raising concerns about the state of the economy. The president is also facing questions over his ability to serve a second presidential term, which would end when he is 86. The classified documents found at two of his properties in Delaware have also prompted criticism. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the country's youngest governor, will deliver the Republican response to the address. She is best known for her tenure as press secretary to former President Donald Trump from 2017-19. The rebuttal is often delivered by young rising stars in the opposition party and frequently from outside Washington. Senior aides to Mrs Sanders - who took the oath of office four weeks ago to become governor of Arkansas - said she would lay out her priorities for the state and discuss issues at the southern border.

The hostel that gives wine or beer to alcoholics,"In the first project of its kind in Scotland, a hostel in Glasgow aims to stabilise alcoholics by giving them alcohol. It is 10:00 and Peter is getting his first ""pour"" of the day - an agreed measure of lager deemed sufficient to curb his cravings to binge. Peter is 60 and has been a chronic alcoholic since he was a teenager.  He is one of 10 men at the Managed Alcohol Programme (MAP) in Glasgow, which is based on a model used in Canada I visited three years ago. It is for the most chaotic homeless alcoholics who have already tried and failed traditional abstinence programmes.  Every hour or two hours the residents are given a measure of wine or beer to keep sufficient alcohol in their bloodstream to prevent a seizure but not enough to get them drunk. In addition they get a home, stability and some structure, the chance to engage with mental health services and develop their interests.  The proposal was controversial with some but it has now been up and running for 12 months.  For the past few months we have had exclusive access to the pilot. The first time we go in with the camera in October 2022 one resident seems a little inebriated, lurching from wall to wall.  There's been an argument between one man who has been buying extra alcohol and another who is trying his best to reduce his intake.  Peter admits he has had a lot to drink. His best friend has just died from an alcohol-related illness. He doesn't want to die the same way but for today, he is drowning his pain. He says: ""I think I was an alcoholic when I was 16, because I used to drink two bottles of wine, two bottles of Buckfast every night with my mum."" She bought it for him, he says. When we return two weeks later, Peter is doing better. He has been to the dentist for the first time in decades, started eating meals, and getting in touch with his family after years of silence and shame. Every Monday he has a music lesson. His voice - deep and hoarse - tells a story in itself. I ask him where he would be if he wasn't here. ""I'd be dead,"" he says. ""Because I just kept doing it - buying drink. This has helped me a lot, this place."" Now, eight months after he entered the house, Peter is talking about getting a flat of his own and a dog.  Paul is making lunch for himself and the other residents. Pork chops, mashed potatoes and vegetables. Eating hot meals together is one of the benefits of the programme. The 51-year-old says he has an appetite for the first time in decades. He spent much of his childhood in hospital because of a serious skin condition.  Paul says he already had a problem with alcohol by the time he was a teenager. When he was referred to the MAP he says he was consuming around 30 units - equivalent to almost a bottle of vodka - a day.  ""I was seeing the police every day because I was doing my drinking on the street,"" he says. ""I was getting lifted by the police every Friday or Saturday.  ""I need to start slowing down. My body isn't going to take much more. This place has opened my eyes to that."" After lunch he receives his 'pour' - a can of lager in his room. He sips it while sketching Glasgow's iconic statue of the Duke of Wellington with a traffic cone on his head.  ""I am a wee bit happier, believe it or not, but the thing is when you come out of drunkenness after 20 or 30 years then your regrets come back as well,"" he says. ""You realise what a mess you have made of your life. And then the guilt comes in."" Paul says he feels much more positive about his future.  But just the next day staff say his drinking and behaviour spirals out of control and he is asked to leave the project.  For some the MAP will not work. Paul and another man have already been told to leave the project and a third has left through mutual agreement.  Manager Peter McLachlan says the first year has been a ""learning curve"" with ""bumps"" along the way. ""For some guys this might not be the right place, it might not be the right treatment, they might not be ready for it at this particular time,"" he says.  But those still in the service have significantly cut their drinking, Mr McLachlan says. They have started to look after themselves, started going to the dentist, optician, and GP, and significantly reduced their run-ins with police and paramedics.  Not every applicant is accepted. Blood tests, liver scans and psychological assessments are done to see if the men are physically strong enough.  The project is funded by the homeless charity the Simon Community with support from the Scottish government. Not everyone supported the idea or methodology. Traditionally alcohol rehabilitation has focused on detox. But views have changed since the MAP opened and there is already interest from other areas in Scotland, England and other European countries. Karyn McCluskey, the head of Community Justice Scotland, was behind piloting the Canadian model here. She analysed the cost to emergency services of these men street-drinking before they entered the project and believes the cost of not having the MAP would run into ""millions"" of pounds. ""One of the men that I looked at had been taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary by ambulance over 400 times in a period of two and a bit years,"" she tells the BBC.  ""That is extortionate. I mean serious amounts of money. Probably millions."" She says some people may have a ""visceral reaction"" to the MAP but that telling these men to stop has not worked.  She says: ""The tears of their children and families would have made them stop but they can't so we have to try to give them less.""  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-64464406

Cost of living: GP concerns over rise in signs of malnutrition,"More cases of malnutrition are being seen in Scotland, according to doctors working in some of the most deprived communities.   A group called GPs at the Deep End is concerned the cost-of-living crisis is making people more reliant on cheaper, processed foods. Dr Jen Dooley told the BBC people were choosing the wrong foods to 'fill up'. She said she often saw patients lacking in basic vitamins and minerals. GPs at the Deep End is a network representing doctors working in surgeries in the 100 most deprived populations in the country.  Dr Dooley, who is based in Port Glasgow in Inverclyde, said: ""We're seeing a lot of cases where people come to us feeling a whole diverse range of presentation - fatigue, tiredness - and when we're investigating, we're finding signs of malnutrition."" With less money to spend on their weekly food shop, Dr Dooley said she was worried people were eating food that was very energy-dense. ""It's not very nutritious and I think what we're seeing is the impact of that,"" she said. Dr Dooley said food banks did good work but she worried they were unable to provide fresh, quality food. ""They tend to be providing packaged food, tinned food, dried food and it's just not as nutritious,"" she said.  She praised the community pantry model which sees a range of food, including fresh fruit and veg, sold at a fraction of the usual price to people who sign up to be members. At the Kidzeco community pantry in Bathgate, mum-of-three Jenna McNabb said being able to keep her children well fed took the stress and burden off her family. Ms McNabb said: ""A weekly shop has gone from about £60 if you went to a normal supermarket up to about £100 now, so to be able to come here has cut our food bills so much."" She said knowing her two young children were well fed was hugely important to her. The charity's managing director Tracey Murdoch said demand was vast and mostly from working families. ""We work on shopping slots, and we can only offer so many per week,"" she said. ""We do it on a computerised system and they're booked out within an hour."" New research from Which? suggests one in 10 consumers in Scotland are skipping meals and financial pressures are leading people to make choices that could be harmful to their health.  As well as not having enough to eat, malnutrition can be a result of not eating the right things.  According to the Scottish Health Survey, two-thirds of adults in Scotland were overweight in 2021. Prof Mike Lean, from the University of Glasgow, is concerned that the stress of the current financial climate could lead to more overeating. The nutritionist said: ""Obesity in Scotland is always cited as being among the highest in Europe and it is. ""There's a lot of other people who are at risk of gaining weight if conditions change.  ""Cost of living, lockdowns - these can all exacerbate behaviours which tend to result in increased calorie consumption without the physical activity you need to burn it off.  ""The cheapest foods are the old-fashioned traditional ones. Lentil soup is a very cheap, very nutritious meal."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-64518568
Book prices need to rise for businesses to survive - industry body,"Book prices in Wales need to increase for businesses to survive rising publishing costs, an industry body has warned. The Books Council of Wales (BCW) said prices had been ""artificially low"" to encourage customers to keep on buying. One Welsh publisher said the price of paper increased by 40% last year, with ink and glue prices rising too. Another company said it would print a smaller selection of books as it tried to absorb the extra costs. Many Welsh publishers depend on grants from the BCW, which is based in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, to fund the publication of titles which are culturally significant but not necessarily commercially successful. This includes many Welsh language books, whose market is small but well-supported. BCW's head of business, Mererid Boswell, said book prices had been ""stagnant"" because of a fear that customers would stop buying if prices increased. ""What we found was, on the contrary: if the quality of the cover and the awareness of the author is good, then people do buy that book, regardless of its cover price,"" she said.  ""I think we've got to be a little bit more confident about the quality of our books, because we're not doing ourselves justice by keeping prices artificially low."" Ms Boswell added that a low price did not ""help the authors, it doesn't help the presses. But importantly, it doesn't help the book shops, either"". The publisher Rily, which is based in Caerphilly and produces original Welsh and English language books, said the economic conditions meant it would have to scale back its plans. ""I think it's a new reality, and that is worrying,"" co-founder Richard Tunnicliffe said. He runs Rily with his wife, and the couple recently restructured the company to try to become more efficient, but Mr Tunnicliffe said he was concerned about the wider publishing industry in Wales. ""I am not confident everybody is going to survive if it is a prolonged recession. If it is a prolonged period of rising prices and reduced sales, it will take its impact,"" he said. ""I can't see the transport costs coming down. I can't see paper costs coming down. I can't see any of them coming down."" Without support from the BCW and the Welsh government, he said a lot of publishers ""wouldn't have survived"". A different Welsh publisher said its printing costs had increased largely due to a 40% rise in the price of paper last year, and its energy bills had almost trebled as prices spiked. There have also been above-inflation increases in the cost of ink and glue, which are essential to the printing trade. Despite some publishers cutting back, the BCW has called for a greater variety of new books from Welsh publishers, which it hoped could reach new readers. This call is supported by organisers of one of the world's leading literary festivals, which takes place in the Powys town of Hay-on-Wye every summer. ""Clearly, it's a really challenging time for authors, for publishers,"" said Hay Festival chief executive Julie Finch. ""There are those inherent costs of paper and energy. But there's been a prolific number of new writers entering the market post-Covid.  ""Particularly this year, we have experienced a high number of publishers wanting new people to be heard and seen at the Hay Festival, which is fantastic."" Ms Finch added that many publishers were keen to improve the diversity of the authors they work with. ""Publishers are realising that the diversity in the material that's coming through to them is important because it has to reflect much broader audiences - and possibly new audiences - who they hadn't necessarily thought of, or targeted before,"" she added.

NHS waiting lists: Patient is left scared to go out,"Being confined to home watching ""rubbish TV"", taking 22 tablets a day and left scared to go out are some of the realities of being on an NHS waiting list. The Welsh NHS planned to eliminate two-year waits by March.  Yet the latest figures show 38,600 patients were waiting for 49,594 procedures in November 2022.  The Welsh government said numbers had fallen by a third from a high in March, after record levels during Covid. ""I've hardly got a social life at the moment,"" said Frank Moore, 69, from Newtown, Powys.  ""I used to go out once a week say, socialising to the pub, or wherever, all that's gone and it is horrible. ""When you're scared of going out it's very difficult, so I have a lot less contact."" Mr Moore has been waiting for surgery on a stomach hernia since 2020 and had an operation cancelled in autumn 2021 due to Covid pressure. He is now fearful of going out and aggravating his condition or picking up other illnesses. Mr Moore describes himself as ""uncomfortable all the time"" and does not agree with the simplicity with which his condition has been described as ""non life-threatening"".  ""When they say it's not life-threatening, I dispute that fact because somebody with mental health problems, they could tip over the edge quite easily and I'm sure it probably happens,"" he said.  While it has affected his relationship with his grandchildren, Denise Cole, from Neath, is enduring similar heartache.  ""Simple things, little ones' sports day, grandmothers' race. You know, 'Oh come on grandma, do it'. 'I'm sorry sweetheart I can't do that' and that really hits,"" she said. ""There are people out there worse than we are, but the effect on life is awful, really is awful. ""My balance is affected and I don't want to fall flat on my face in front of my grandchildren."" The 57-year-old tore cartilage in her knee in 2017 and also has arthritis, taking 22 tablets a day to manage the pain.  A full knee replacement was planned, but last year she was referred to a different surgeon for a partial knee replacement instead, meaning she is again on a waiting list. Ms Cole says she is tired of sitting at home watching ""rubbish TV"" and wishes she could be more active with her grandchildren. Christine Haley, from Swansea, also needs knee surgery and said she has had three separate urgent referrals, but is still waiting. ""It's like every day you're waiting for the mail,"" the 66-year-old said. Swansea Bay health board, which covers Ms Haley, is doing much of its planned orthopaedic surgery at Neath Port Talbot Hospital in Port Talbot. However, she has been told she must have her surgery at Morriston Hospital, Swansea, where there is a waiting list of more than four years, because of underlying health conditions.  That has left Ms Haley feeling like she is ""back on the scrap heap again"" and ""old before her time"". ""It's not just affecting your knee, it's throwing all your body out of kilter,"" she said. ""Pain levels can make you really irritable with people you're close to."" The Welsh government said: ""The number of people waiting more than two years for treatment has fallen by nearly a third to the end of November 2022 compared to a high in March.  ""We are committed to ensuring no-one waits longer than a year for treatment in most specialities by spring 2025. ""These patient stories highlight the importance of this commitment, and while we already have excellent examples of this working well for people, we know we have more to do."" Betsi Cadwaladr health board - which is treating Mr Moore - admitted ""unacceptably long waits"" had a ""significant impact on people's quality of life"".  ""Reducing waiting times is a key priority and we're continuing to do all we can to ensure that people are seen in order of clinical priority as quickly and as safely as possible,"" said deputy executive director of nursing Chris Lynes. Swansea Bay health board, which is treating Ms Cole and Ms Haley, described long waits as ""far from ideal"". ""We are already delivering on our plans to reduce waiting times,"" a statement said.  ""Between April and the end of December 2022 the number of people waiting over two years for treatment fell by 38%. However, we are determined to do even more to bring waiting times down further.""

Beyoncé superfan credits star with saving her life,"After a week of stress, sweat and tears, a Beyoncé super fan from Angus has managed to bag tickets to her idol's first solo tour in seven years. Gwen Denholm from Kirriemuir believes the singer has helped save her life. She said her music has seen her through tough times battling Parkinson's disease and bipolar disorder. After being unsuccessful in ticket presales, Ms Denholm finally secured tickets to her idol's Renaissance World Tour on the day of the general sale.  Due to her health issues, she needed tickets which could accommodate a wheelchair. However she said disabled tickets are sparse, so she ended up spending a small fortune - £900 - on VIP hospitality tickets. Ms Denholm, 56, told BBC Scotland it was worth it. ""I was crying this morning,"" she said. ""My hands wouldn't work so my husband took time off work to help me buy the tickets. ""It means so much to me. I don't think I will see her again. I'm not as good as I should be, so this is it."" The UK concerts are part of a world tour in support of her Renaissance album, which the won best dance/electronic album at the Grammys on Sunday.  Ticket prices ranged from £56 to £252 - and some VIP packages which include guaranteed front row seats or even seats on the stage stretch to more than £2,300. Ms Denholm has followed Beyoncé's career since she emerged as part of Destiny's Child in the late nineties and said listening to Beyoncé's hits helped her though dark periods in her life. ""I loved her music, I was inspired by the group,""  Ms Denholm said. ""When she went solo, she just took it to another level.  ""I was in the hospital quite a lot, so I had a wee iPod at the time with all of Beyoncé's music. ""My headphones were never off and I willed myself better using her music.  ""She saved my life on a number of occasions actually."" The superfan, known as Momma Gwen to fellow fans, created the Beyhive Momma group dedicated to fans on Facebook with over 13,000 members. She said they were praying for her to get her hands on tickets. ""There are so many people out there that think like me, admire her so much, look up to her - and that's where this group that I have got has come from,"" she said. ""And it is global."" The struggle for tour tickets has been difficult, with demand vastly outstripping availability and technical errors plaguing sales. The Murrayfield gig on 20 May was all but sold out within the hour when tickets went on sale at 10:00.  Seeing that the star had added a third, fourth and fifth date at London's Tottenham Hotspur stadium, fans took to social media to call for a second Scottish date. Some users got an error message on the Ticketmaster website, while others said they were kicked out of the queue - which in some cases was 500,000 strong. ""There's been a lot of mixed emotions,"" said Ms Denholm. ""The site was down, it was crazy. She broke the internet."" Luckily, the fan has already managed to see Beyoncé live three times. ""The first time was in 2014 at the Hydro when she did the Mrs Carter tour,"" she said. ""I took my husband to that one and she did most of her show sitting on a chair - and I don't think his eyes moved off the stage! ""So he fell in love with her from then on as well."" Ms Denholm also went to the star's last solo tour, the Formation World Tour, and her subsequent On The Run 2 tour with husband Jay-Z. Now she has her latest tickets, she wants to meet up with the fans who help her run the group for the first time.  But her ultimate aim is to meet Beyoncé herself. She said: ""This is a once in a lifetime chance. The Beyhive Momma is from Scotland, Beyoncé is coming to Murrayfield and I am going to be so close. ""I would love her to come and see me so I can tell her what I do for the fans  - and I will buy her a glass of wine."" Asked why she had so much admiration for Beyoncé, she said: ""She's just so determined to do what she wants and what she thinks is right, even if people don't like her for it. ""She has given me avenues I never would've explored.  ""And Beyoncé's fans don't like negativity, we all respect one another and we look after one another.""

UK economy likely to avoid recession - think tank,"The UK is likely to avoid a recession this year, an economic think tank has predicted. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said the economy will grow marginally despite high prices hitting household budgets. But it warned while the UK may not fall into recession, it will feel like one for at least seven million households. The forecast comes ahead of figures showing how well the UK economy is doing, which are due on Friday. An economic recession is defined as when the economy shrinks for two consecutive three-month periods. If a country's economy shrinks, it means it's performing badly and typically, companies make less money and cut jobs leaving the government with less tax revenue to spend on public services. NIESR has predicted the economy will grow by 0.2% this year, with growth rising to 1% in 2024. The forecast paints a more optimistic picture than others, such as the Bank of England's. However NIESR's still warned the rising cost of living would mean for millions, particular in the North East of England and in parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, it would feel like a recession.  Inflation, which is the rate prices rise at, has been hitting the budgets of UK households, with energy and food costs high. NIESR said one in four UK households - some seven million families - would be unable to meet in full their planned energy and food bills from their post-tax income in the 2023-24 financial year, up from around one in five in 2022-23. Middle-income households would face a hit to their disposable income ranging from 7% to 13%, reaching up to £4,000 in this financial year, its researchers added. It said as many people examine their finances, fewer will be able to retire early, meaning more workers between the ages of 50-64 will return to work.  The government has been considering plans to coax retired middle-aged workers back into jobs to boost the economy, with 300,000 fewer people in employment than before the pandemic.  A Treasury spokesperson, in response to the research by the NIESR, said the UK was not immune to global challenges of high inflation and slow growth.  The government reiterated it's a plan to halve inflation, which is at 10.5%, this year, but many economists expect this to happen anyway largely due to a slowdown in energy price rises and as post-pandemic supply problems ease. NIESR's forecast comes after several others, which have not gone as far as suggesting the UK economy will avoid recession. The Bank of England said last week the UK is set to enter recession this year but one which will be shorter and less severe than previously thought. The Bank has raised interest rates to 4% - their highest level in 14 years - in a bid to curb inflation. The Bank's governor Andrew Bailey explained that the slump it predicts is now expected to last just over a year rather than almost two, due to energy bills falling and price rises slowing down. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which works to stabilise economic growth, has predicted a more gloomy picture for the UK economy. It has forecast it to shrink and perform worse than other advanced economies, including Russia. Economic forecasters are not always right when it comes to predicting the future. For example, the IMF's forecasts have picked up fewer than 10% of recessions a year ahead of time, according to an analysis it conducted of recessions around the world between 1992 and 2014.

Lloyd's of London boss warns UK's financial reputation is dented,"The UK's reputation for financial stability was dented by a year of political turmoil, says the boss of insurance giant Lloyd's of London. John Neal said confidence in the UK had been hit by a high turnover of prime ministers and a mini-budget which saw the pound drop and mortgage rates soar. He said he believed the government could recover its credibility by working with business to get it right. The government said it had taken action to ""restore economic stability"". As the world's largest insurance market, Lloyd's of London is one of the leading financial institutions in the City of London. It insures a variety of risks from all over the world and is sensitive to the UK's reputation. Mr Neal said the UK's reputation for economic stability had suffered in September when then-Prime Minister Liz Truss and then-Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng announced £45bn of unfunded tax cuts. This was followed by days of turmoil on the markets, a fall in the value of the pound and rises in the cost of UK government borrowing and mortgage rates. Mr Neal said other factors that harmed the UK's reputation included having three prime ministers and four chancellors in 2022 as well as the additional costs associated with Brexit. ""All of them don't help us because I think we had huge credibility around stability and certainty,"" he said. ""And I think what we need to do through 2023 and 2024 is begin to rebuild that stability.""  He said the UK should not take its position as a global financial centre for granted.   ""We're at an important moment. We've really got to re-prove our value proposition, I think there's a responsibility on government and us in business to get it right.  ""I think we can get it right but we have got to work hard,"" he said. The government said it had taken ""difficult decisions on tax and spend"" to restore economic stability in the UK.  ""We are now focusing on halving inflation, reducing our debt, and growing the economy - including reforming EU-era insurance rules that could unlock over £100bn in investment,"" a spokesperson added. Last year was not just a turbulent 12 months in politics, it was a risky and expensive one for insurers. The industry saw losses of more than $120bn (£100bn) from natural disasters - 20% higher than the five-year average.  Mr Neal predicted the increasing frequency and severity of floods, hurricanes and wildfires would see that trend continue to rise as the climate changes.   ""I would be really disappointed if you ever sat down with an insurer who denied climate because the statistics are terrifying both in terms of frequency and severity,"" he said. The Lloyds market could provide insurance of up to $200bn but at a cost, he added. ""We can provide insurance but does the cost of that insurance go up? The answer is definitively yes. But there still is an opportunity for the individual to be protected.""  You might expect an insurance salesman to say that but he said there are some risks the Lloyd's market could not fully cover.  One of the fastest emerging classes of risk is cyber-attack. So far the market is small - just $12bn worldwide - but Lloyds has made it clear that state-sponsored systemic cyber-attacks will not be covered. ""If it was a Russian state-sponsored attack that systemically attacks software, you know, there's no way that any industry has got the money to cover that. That could be a loss of $300 or $400bn I mean, it could be that big,"" Mr Neal said. Asked how Lloyd's would know if an attack had been launched by a state, he said: ""We would have to take our lead from governments as to how they classified such an attack.""  Given the stakes, that could make for an interesting conversation between governments and insurers as to who pays for what.  A more recent systemic risk was Covid and Mr Neal admitted the pandemic was not a great moment for Lloyd's.  There were protracted disputes about whether so-called business interruption policies to compensate firms for closure were covered by existing policies. There has been a fourfold increase in legal action against insurers for unpaid claims.   ""It [insurance] didn't do its job I agree. So I don't think that was a good day. And I think there's a real pressure on us for ourselves, and the regulators not to repeat that situation,"" he said. But Mr Neal insisted the world has rarely needed insurance more. ""There are only three times in 200 years when we really mattered. And this is one of them,"" he said. ""If you think of recent events, you know we've had Brexit, we've had Covid, the evidence of systemic risk. We debate climate, we've got war in the Ukraine. ""Whether you're an individual going through the economic challenges that everybody has today with food prices and energy prices, or a business, risk is at the forefront of your mind.  ""And our job on our best day is to give an individual or a business the confidence to make the brave financial decisions they need to make."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64553955
McDonald's manager 'exposed himself in front of me',"Christine was working at a South London branch of McDonald's in 2018 when, she says, she was sexually harassed by a manager. ""He pulled his pants down in the stockroom,"" she said, adding the experience left her ""terrified"". Her story comes after McDonald's signed an agreement with the UK equality watchdog following concerns over how it handled sexual harassment complaints. McDonald's said Christine's experiences were ""completely unacceptable"". ""We are extremely concerned to hear these allegations,"" a spokesperson said. ""We would encourage them to contact us directly so we can investigate immediately."" Currently, the amount of complaints of sexual harassment made by McDonald's workers in the UK is unclear, but four years ago the union representing the company's employees, the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU), said it had received 1,000 of them.  Concerns were raised by employees via the union about inadequate processes to deal with the allegations, which led the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to get involved. And on Wednesday, it was announced that the fast food giant had signed a legal agreement with the EHRC to protect staff from sexual harassment. The agreement, known as the section 23 agreement under the Equality Act 2010, means the EHRC will now monitor the company to check if it is complying with the law. If it finds evidence it is not, it will investigate. The EHRC told the BBC that it did ""not enter into agreements lightly"". Christine, who has waived her right to anonymity, started working at McDonald's in 2011, having just moved to London. She told the BBC she ""thought it would be really great"", but added ""I had no idea what I was walking into"". She described a toxic workplace culture, with managers flirting with more junior staff, and another manager going around ""touching everyone's bum"". ""I saw a lot of things that were not okay,"" she said. She described how one manager constantly came up to her and said ""inappropriate things"".  She tried to manage the situation by asking colleagues to intervene. Christine then said she started suffering anxiety and panic attacks, and started taking anti-depressants ""just to cope with going into work"". ""How do you expect to work when you're having a panic attack, you can't breathe? Your heart's racing, and you're terrified,"" she said. ""You don't want this person to come up to you doing or saying anything. You would assume that they get the message when you say no, but they just think it's okay. They don't see what they're doing to you."" Things took a turn for the worst one day in 2018, when she was feeling unwell and went into the stockroom to ask the manager's permission to go home. ""He started making really inappropriate sexual suggestions that I wasn't comfortable with,"" she said. ""He pulled his pants down in the stockroom and wanted me to do inappropriate things."" Christine said she walked out and went to her business manager to raise a complaint, but added after the business manager spoke to the man in question, she was told to ""get back in the kitchen and work with him"". When she objected, the business manager told her to call the police if she had such a problem.  ""So I was like, fine. I packed up my stuff and went home,"" she said. Christine never worked at McDonald's again, although she claims the man is still employed there. She described her time working at the fast food chain as ""one of the worst experiences of my life"". ""I want McDonald's to realise what they're doing is not okay,"" she said. ""It feels like you're being bullied, it feels like you don't have a voice,"" she said.  ""You should not have to go into work feeling anxious or scared...you need that job to pay your bills and to keep a house going but at what price."" In response to Christine's story, McDonald's said the experiences described by her were ""completely unacceptable and have no place in our restaurants"". A spokesperson added the safety of its teams and customers was an ""absolute priority"" and said the company encouraged ""all employees to speak up if they have any concerns of any kind"". Ranjit O'Mahony of Thompsons Solicitors, which has worked with the union on sexual harassment complaints, any cases the firm had been instructed by the BFAWU had been ""settled with a confidentiality clause at McDonalds insistence"".  She said that the firm ""wash their hands of legal liability if they possibly can by passing the buck to local managers, and the franchise system they operate for the stores enables them to do so"". Under the section 23 agreement, McDonald's has committed to a number of measures to protect staff in the UK from sexual harassment. These include communicating a zero tolerance approach to sexual harassment and improving responses to complaints. Other measures include conducting an anonymous survey of workers about workplace safety, and providing anti-harassment training for employees. Baroness Kishwer Falkner, chairwoman of the EHRC, said that by signing this agreement, McDonald's had shown its intent to make its restaurants ""safe places to work"". Meanwhile, Alistair Macrow, chief executive of McDonald's Restaurants Limited in UK and Ireland said he welcomed the ""opportunity to work with the EHRC"" and added harassment and abuse had ""no place"" at McDonald's. But Sarah Woolley, general secretary at the BWAFU, said she didn't have ""a lot of confidence"" that the agreement would change the culture at McDonald's and said the union didn't believe complainants had been consulted on ""how they believe problem should be fixed"". There have been sexual harassment allegations by workers at the McDonald's US restaurants over several years. In October 2021, McDonald's workers walked out at restaurants in 12 US cities in protest at the fast food giant's handling of sexual harassment claims. In 2019, Steve Easterbrook was fired as chief executive of McDonald's after finding he had had a consensual relationship with an employee, with the firm stating he had ""violated company policy"". Further investigation uncovered hidden relationships with other staff members and in January, In January, he was fined by the US financial watchdog for misleading investors about his firing in 2019. Mr Easterbrook agreed to pay a $400,000 penalty, without admitting or denying the claims. The food giant prohibits ""any kind of intimate relationship between employees in a direct or indirect reporting relationship"". ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64553852
SNP MP Stewart McDonald's emails hacked by Russian group,"An MP has told the BBC his emails have been stolen and he fears they will be made public. The SNP's Stewart McDonald said the hack took place in January and he wanted to pre-empt any publication sharing them. The group responsible are believed to be linked to Russia's spy services.   The UK's cyber-defence agency has warned about targeted attacks on politicians in recent weeks.  On 13 January Mr McDonald was walking down the street when he received a notification on his phone. There was a new message in the MP's private email account. He glanced at it - it was from a member of his staff.  There was nothing suspicious about it and it came from the staff member's real email account.  The message said there was a password protected document attached which had a military update on Ukraine.  This made sense as the MP for Glasgow South had taken a close interest in Ukraine for a number of years, receiving the order of merit from the Ukrainian government.  He had also been the defence spokesperson for the SNP until last year. Mr McDonald clicked on the document.  It brought up a login page for the email account he was using. He put in his password.  Strangely, it then brought up a blank page.  Perhaps it was not loading properly on his phone, he thought?  He would ask the staff member to resend it next time they spoke. What he did not know yet was that a hacking group believed to be linked to Russia's intelligence services was now inside his account - a group which has on other occasions published emails belonging to public figures. A few days later, the member of staff mentioned to the MP that he had been locked out of his personal email account because of suspicious activity and was having problems trying to prove his identity and get back in.  ""I meant to ask you about that email you sent. I couldn't open the attachment,"" Mr McDonald recalls saying to him. ""I didn't send any email,"" the member of staff replied. Alarm bells were now ringing for the MP.  The advice was to contact the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), an arm of the UK's intelligence agency, GCHQ.  Working with the parliamentary security team, they asked for the email and attachment to be sent so they could examine it.  The NCSC was already preparing to issue an advisory about a hacking group, known as Seaborgium saying it was responsible for a highly targeted campaign against individuals including politicians, activists and journalists. That advisory tallies closely with what Mr McDonald experienced - the compromise of individuals, like his staff member, so they can in turn be used to send emails to the primary target.  These are highly targeted and sophisticated attacks against a small number of people rather than the broad-bush sending of malicious emails that are usually seen. Sources say the advisory was long-planned and confirm the same group is believed to be behind the hack of Mr McDonald's account. The British government has not formally accused the Russian state of being behind the group or the hacks but within the wider cyber-security community the group has been identified as linked to Russia's intelligence services. The same group is said to have published hacked emails and documents by other individuals, including the former head of MI6 Sir Richard Dearlove, as well as journalist Paul Mason. Mr McDonald says he has decided to go public to warn others of the risks and limit the potential damage as he waits to see what the hackers do with the stolen material. ""If it is indeed a malicious state-backed group, then, in line with what I've seen elsewhere, I expect them to dump some of the information online.  ""And I can expect them to manipulate and fake some of that content and I want to get out ahead of that to ensure any disinformation attack against me is discredited before it's even published,"" he told the BBC. ""An incident has been reported to us and we are providing the individual with support,"" a spokesperson for the NCSC told the BBC.  ""The NCSC regularly provides security briefings and guidance to parliamentarians to help them defend against the latest cyber threats. This includes expert advice for MPs and their staff available on the NCSC website."" Mr McDonald continues to be unsure what - if anything - will be done with the stolen material. Even though he was aware of the risks before the incident he has since then taken additional steps to secure his accounts. ""It can catch people even those who are alive to these threats,"" he said.

India paper leaks: Cheating plagues India jobs coveted by millions,"On a chilly December morning, police in the western state of Rajasthan saw a bus heading towards Udaipur city and followed it.  The night before, they had received a tip-off - the question paper for an examination to recruit teachers in the state's government schools was going to be leaked in the morning, just hours before millions of students were to take the test. Some 1,193 exam centres were set up for the eagerly-awaited recruitment drive on 24 December.  In India, where government jobs are highly coveted, cases of aspiring candidates resorting to unfair means are not uncommon. One way many job-seekers try to secure a place is by cheating in exams, which includes buying question papers or paying someone else to write the test on their behalf.  The bus in Udaipur was on its way to an examination centre and police suspected that those leaking the paper were on it.  At first, they waited at a distance as the bus circled around a building for a few minutes. Then they stopped it.   ""Inside, we found four government school teachers who were solving question papers for at least 20 candidates,"" an official, who wished to stay anonymous, told the BBC.   The aspirants had allegedly paid the teachers, who were on invigilation duty at the centre, money - the police did not specify how much - to solve the papers for them. Around 20 ""dummy"" candidates, who were paid by aspirants to take the test on their behalf, were also caught from the bus. Police alleged the accused were carrying fake IDs.  A total of 48 people were arrested in connection with the scam that morning, prompting authorities to cancel the examination process.  Two of the main accused are yet to be caught - authorities have announced a bounty of $1,500 (£1,245) on each of them, Udaipur police chief Vikas Sharma told the BBC. The incident was the latest in a series of scams where question papers for crucial government exams have been leaked or solved in exchange for money. Since 2018, at least 12 recruitment drives have been cancelled in the state after the test was leaked - just days, sometimes hours, before the exam.  Aspiring students say they are frustrated by the delays and are beginning to lose faith in the recruitment process. ""I don't think I will come again for the test,"" says Santosh Kumawat, the 30-year-old mother who has travelled twice from the neighbouring state of Maharashtra to appear for the exam in Rajasthan.  ""First time, they called off the exam. The second time, our answer sheets were abruptly snatched away midway as the question paper had leaked,"" she said. The problem is not unique to Rajasthan - exam leaks are notoriously common across India, where millions are unemployed and in search of secure jobs.  Political scientist Pankaj Kumar, who headed the Public Service Commission of Uttar Pradesh state that recruits civil servants, says ""it's the craze for a government position which makes people desperate"". Government jobs in India are generally for life and Mr Kumar says millions often wait for years to get one and ""spending money to cheat eventually becomes the motto of some aspirants"". In Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at least nine attempts to recruit schoolteachers and junior clerks have been cancelled since 2014 due to paper leaks. In the eastern state of West Bengal, authorities had to launch an investigation last year after question papers to hire teachers were widely shared on social media, hours before the exam.  The story is no different in the central state of Madhya Pradesh which was rocked by a massive recruitment scam in 2009 when aspirants taking a medical exam hired students from neighbouring states to write their papers. Question papers were also leaked and sold to candidates at astronomical prices, before authorities clamped down and arrested thousands. The heartland states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are equally infamous.  In Bihar, students are sometimes not allowed to wear shoes and socks to exam centres to stop them from cheating. In the past, authorities have imposed fines, jail terms and even detained parents for allegedly helping their children cheat.  In neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, exams are often conducted under CCTV surveillance.  Police say lapses usually occur when question papers are being transported to examination centres. In other instances, like in Udaipur, students go to great lengths to fake their identity, making it almost impossible for authorities to catch them.  There are no clear laws to deal with the problem at the moment, as most cases are recorded as bailable offences such as fraud and cheating. Some states like Uttarakhand have passed a law to punish offenders with life imprisonment, but critics say this has done little to improve the situation.  Ashok Rathore, a senior official investigating paper leaks in Rajasthan, says authorities need to come up with new ways of policing to tackle the problem.  ""We have asked the government to involve police and local administration even before the exam begins so that the question papers are beyond the reach of cheaters - just like ballot boxes are kept safe until the votes are counted,"" he said.  But experts say the problem also shines a spotlight on the unemployment crisis in India, where millions are unable to find jobs.  India's unemployment rate crept up to nearly 8% in December 2022, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), an independent think tank. It was less than 7% in 2021.  Almost 20 million people in India are employed by the federal and state governments, and officials estimate that at least a million more jobs are lying vacant at the moment.  ""Even 30 years after liberalisation, India doesn't have enough jobs for its population, which is nearing 1.4 billion,"" says writer and political commentator Gurcharan Das. He adds that government jobs are more lucrative in a country where three-quarters of its workforce is self employed with little to no social security benefits.  ""Unlike government jobs, private jobs do not come with a lifelong guarantee of security and pensions,"" Mr Das said. The job aspirants say their future looks bleak because of paper leaks and repeated cancellation of exams - they fear that they will soon be past the age limit to apply for these positions.  ""I attended years of coaching classes to qualify for a government job, but most of my exams got cancelled,"" said Devender Sharma.  The 30-year-old from the Bikaner city in Rajasthan has been applying for a decade for a low-skilled government job in the state.  ""My parents blame me for failing, even though it's the system which has let us down,"" he said.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-64495673
King Charles unadorned new stamp design revealed,"The image of King Charles III that is to appear on new stamps from 4 April has been revealed by the Royal Mail. The minimalist, unadorned picture, with no crown on the stamp or any other decoration, was approved personally by the King. ""The feedback we got back was that he wanted it to be simple,"" said Royal Mail director of external affairs, David Gold. ""It's a very human image, with no embellishment,"" he said. The design was also intended to provide continuity, influenced by the classic profile of Queen Elizabeth II created by the artist Arnold Machin in 1967. The new stamp is even more pared back and stark. It does not have any crown or royal symbols - unlike many of the predecessors, where kings' stamps often include an image of a crown and queens are depicted wearing a crown or diadem. ""It was 70 years that we had the same monarch and since 1967 we've had pretty much the same stamps,"" said Mr Gold. He said people would now have to get accustomed to seeing the new image on everyday first- and second-class stamps. Britain's postage stamps are unique in not showing the name of the country, and the new stamps have nothing except the King's head, the price and also, now, an attached barcode. The design is based on a sculpture made by artist Martin Jennings for the new King Charles coins - with the image then digitally adapted for stamps. Millions of new stamps are being printed, which will be used concurrently with those of Queen Elizabeth II, which will be sold until the old stocks run out. The image released by the Royal Mail is for so-called ""definitive"" stamps, which are the regular, plain, non-commemorative postage stamps. Some of the first sheets were unveiled at the Postal Museum in London, which is showing an exhibition called the King's Stamp. King Charles becomes the seventh monarch to appear on stamps - Queen Victoria was the first, in 1840, when her profile was shown on a ""Penny Black"". The picture of Queen Victoria used on the first stamps originated from an earlier sketch drawn when she was 15 years old, and that continued as the image used until her death at the age of 81.  King Charles has been an inveterate letter writer - figures from the Duchy of Cornwall suggest he personally wrote 1,830 letters in his final year as Prince of Wales, in response to more than 50,000 sent to him by the public. His letter writing when Prince of Wales also drew him into accusations of meddling in politics. During the Covid pandemic he wrote a personal letter praising the importance of postal workers as a ""point of daily human contact, a friendly, familiar face"", addressing his envelope to ""Everyone at Royal Mail"".

HS2 Ltd miscalculating impact on nature - Wildlife Trusts,"The company building the controversial HS2 rail line has underestimated its impact on habitats and wildlife, according to a coalition of wildlife charities. A report by the Wildlife Trusts found that HS2 Ltd had missed trees, ponds and hedgerows off maps. It said the methodology used to calculate the impact on biodiversity of the project was ""fundamentally flawed"". HS2 Ltd said the trusts' report was ""not reliable"". The trusts are calling for construction to be paused and for the government to require HS2 Ltd to re-evaluate the impact construction has on nature.  The Wildlife Trusts said their investigation took a year to complete.  ""In addition to the catalogue of errors when assessing the pre-existing nature, this audit found that HS2 Ltd's metric (its 'accounting tool' for assessing impacts on nature) is untested, out of date and fundamentally flawed,"" they said. For developers to calculate the impact of construction projects on the natural world, features like streams, hedges and woods are given values that can fit into a spreadsheet and be accounted for. The trusts' report said that mature hedgerows which ""provide berries, shelter and nesting places for wildlife"" had been given ""a lower nature value than the new hedgerows"" that HS2 Ltd would plant. It said some watercourses, ponds and trees had been ""missed out of the data"". Using HS2 Ltd's data where possible, the report found that Phase One, which covers 140 miles of track between London and the West Midlands, would cause almost eight times ""more nature loss"" than accounted for by HS2 Ltd's calculations. Phase 2a between the West Midlands and Crewe would result in a 42% nature loss, compared with HS2 Ltd's prediction of 17%, according to the document. Dr Rachel Giles from Cheshire Wildlife Trust and author of the report, said she had been shocked by the errors and discrepancies that their audit revealed. ""HS2 Ltd must stop using a deeply flawed method to calculate the value of nature affected by the construction of the route,"" she said. ""It is astonishing that a flagship infrastructure project is able to use a metric which is untested and not fit for purpose.  ""HS2 Ltd should urgently recalculate the total loss to nature, by re-evaluating existing biodiversity along the entire route whilst there is still time to change the scheme's design and delivery."" Tom Oliver, professor of applied ecology at the University of Reading, told the BBC that the report was 'hugely worrying"".  He said that the methodology HS2 Ltd was using was ""ten years out of date"" and that the organisation was ""marking its own homework"". ""You can't go back in time and undo the phase one work that has happened, but for phase two the importance of these natural habitats is so great, the extra work in terms of recalculating ... seems a no-brainer."" Responding to the trusts' report, a spokesperson for HS2 Ltd said that the organisation ""didn't recognise the figures"" nor did it ""believe them to be reliable"".  ""The Wildlife Trusts have undertaken limited desk research and have not accessed huge areas of land for undertaking ecological survey, in contrast to the ecologists who have compiled HS2's data,"" the spokesperson said. They added that it was reviewing its assessment methodology, and intended to ""align more closely with the government's biodiversity metric once it is published in the coming months"". The Trusts said that HS2 Ltd should immediately pause all construction and enabling work, and the bill that authorises the Crewe to Manchester leg of the line should be halted. It called on the company to re-map existing habitats and recalculate the impact on nature. Follow Claire on Twitter ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-64558664
A secret room that saved this girl's life,"A major work by Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky could fetch a record price at auction in London in a few weeks. But behind the sale is one family's story of tragedy and heroism, all laid out in an unpublished memoir, writes Stephen Smith. It begins with a little girl, seven years old, hiding in a secret room.  A woman tells her, ""You're quiet, very quiet, you can't make a sound, no one can know you're here, no one! Do you hear me?"" The woman is the girl's nanny, who looked after her with her mother and grandmother at their house.  ""If you make noise and someone hears it, we could all be killed by the Germans. Did you hear me right?"" The girl doesn't know that she won't see her house again for years and that she will never see her mother or grandmother again.  She doesn't know this place, the nanny's home, nor the nanny's family. But she will spend the next two and a half years here, hidden in this small room, with no company except for a toy elephant called Jumbo, and all because of a deadly secret.  The little girl, Dolly, is Jewish. It is 1943 in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam.  Dolly's story has remarkable parallels with the famous wartime history of Anne Frank, and indeed Anne is hiding in another house less than two miles away at the same time. The two girls are unknown to each other and never meet.  Anne and her family are captured in August 1944 and sent to Auschwitz. Dolly's mother and father and grandmother are also murdered in Auschwitz, but she survives.  Anne's account of living in hiding, The Diary of a Young Girl, becomes one of the most important documents of the Holocaust. Dolly's account of how she came to survive the war is contained in an unpublished memoir but her story is connected to a work of art rather than a book.  It's a groundbreaking modernist masterpiece, in fact, and it's at the centre of a campaign to establish the claims of Dolly's family to an art collection which they lost in the war.  The painting goes on sale in London in a few weeks' time and could fetch more than £35m ($42m), a world record for the artist who made it. They say that every picture tells a story and this one tells the story of Dolly's family, who they were and what happened to them. The acclaimed work is Murnau mit Kirche II (Murnau with Church II) painted in 1910 by the Russian master Wassily Kandinsky.  It once hung in the elegant villa where Dolly's grandparents lived in Potsdam, outside Berlin. An old family photograph shows that the Kandinsky had pride of place in the dining room of Siegbert and Johanna Margarete Stern.  A hundred years ago, they created a successful textile business together. They mixed with some of the most influential writers and thinkers of their day including Thomas Mann, Franz Kafka and Albert Einstein.  The couple appreciated art and were broad-minded in their tastes. Their collection ranged from Dutch old master paintings to Renoir and bold newcomers including Munch and Kandinsky. Siegbert's will includes a record of more than a hundred art works.  Next to the Kandinsky in his will he wrote ""Landschaft"", German for landscape. The Sterns were also active in the Jewish community. In 1916 they helped to set up an organisation to assist Jews who had fled Eastern Europe and were living in poverty in Germany.  With the rise of the Nazis, the Sterns and families like them became targets for persecution. After Siegbert died in 1935, life became increasingly difficult. Some of the children had already left for the Netherlands by this time and Johanna Margarete followed, taking some of her furniture and paintings with her. Like many Jewish families, the Sterns raised funds by selling off precious artworks at cut-throat prices to unscrupulous dealers.  In 1941, Johanna Margarete was declared a stateless person by the Nazis. They held out the tantalising prospect of freedom to her: she could have a visa, allowing her to leave Holland with her family, in exchange for a painting by the French artist Henri Fantin-Latour.  But it was a trick. She handed over the picture but there was no visa. Johanna Margarete went into hiding but she was seized in 1943, as were Dolly's parents. In her memoirs, Dolly describes a desperate scene as her mother and father entrust her into the care of her nanny, Anna, while doing their best to shield her from the horror of what is about to happen.  ""It was late at night, I was already asleep, when my mother's soft voice woke me up. 'Dollychen, you have to get up now. It's not morning yet.' She came and sat on the bed with me and so did my father. They said they had to leave for two weeks, as the Germans wanted that, but then they would come back.... the doorbell suddenly rang very loud and long and my father opened the door. Three officers from the Grüne Polizei [Nazi police force] burst in, their boots making a loud noise of clicking and stamping. They shouted all sorts of orders loudly and roughly for everyone to hurry up: 'Schnell, schnell, sonst schiessen wir [(Quick, quick, otherwise we shoot]'. I hid behind Anna and was scared, very scared."" Dolly's parents were taken away. It was the last she would ever see of them. The next day she made the perilous journey across the city alone to Anna's house. The Nazis forced Jews like Dolly to wear a yellow star but Anna had unstitched it from Dolly's jacket and told the girl that from now on she was to call her Aunty. Part of Anna's house served as a doctor's consulting room and it had a tiny, hidden annex.  This became Dolly's home for the next 30 months.  She had two books, a child's Bible and a collection of fairy tales, which she read and reread. There was a faded poster on the wall which said ""God sees all"" and Dolly wondered how he could see everybody, even her.  ""On the evenings when there were also consultation hours, I had to sit in the dark in autumn and winter. I often stretched out on the floor and counted the feet of the waiting patients through the bottom crack of the door.""  Her solitude was punctuated by the terror of police raids. Anna hid Dolly beneath the floorboards or bundled her into a cupboard under a sink. She was ""made invisible"" under dusters and mops.  ""When the German officers were inside the kitchen, Anna played the innocent. She made German jokes and wound them around her finger, but as soon as they were gone she collapsed like a wet mop and shivered all over."" For a little girl, one of the hardest things was staying perfectly quiet, so when the Allies finally liberated Amsterdam in 1945 and Dolly could come out of hiding, the exhilaration and relief of it was expressed for her in everyday sounds.  ""Like many others I had no shoes. This problem was solved by wooden clogs that were suddenly sold everywhere. A wooden sole and two straps at the top. I loved the clattering. I was allowed to be there and everyone could hear that and was allowed to know that. I was allowed to live again, completely live."" Dolly lived into her late 70s, in fact, and enjoyed her life, to judge by her memoir.  Records of Holocaust survivors include Dolly, born in 1935, who ""went into hiding"" during the war.  Official Dutch documents show that she lived with her nanny Anna during occupation. As far as Dolly's surviving relatives are aware, no one is still alive from that household and the BBC has not been able to separately verify Dolly's account of her experiences. Younger members of her family took on the task of researching the whereabouts of the missing Stern art collection. In 2013, they discovered that there was a Kandinsky in a museum in Eindhoven. It had been there since 1951. Could it be the one from the Potsdam villa?  Curators took a fresh look at it and found the word ""Landschaft"" scratched on the stretcher at the back of the painting. It was the same term that Siegert had used to record the Kandinsky in his will, and the handwriting was a good match for his. Dolly died before the find could be confirmed, but she knew that her family were on the trail of the lost masterpiece.  After a lengthy campaign, it was finally handed to the family. It will be sold at Sotheby's in London next month, when it is expected to reach the highest price ever achieved by the artist.  The proceeds will be divided between the Sterns' 13 surviving heirs and will go towards further research into the fate of their paintings that remain at large. Murnau mit Kirche II is a highly significant work in art history, harking back to what the Russian had absorbed from Cezanne and Van Gogh in Paris, but also looking ahead to the influence he would have over Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and others in New York. Most of Kandinsky's early paintings are already in museum collections and it's rare for one as special as this to come onto the market. Art historians say that the painter had the condition, or gift, of synesthesia: he could look at a colour and hear music.  It seems fitting that his vivid lost masterpiece should be linked to the story of a little girl who found joy in the everyday music of footsteps in liberated streets.  Dolly's family did not want to use her surname in this article because they want to protect their identity.  Murnau mit Kirche II by Wassily Kandinsky will be auctioned at Sotheby's, London, on 1 March.  Stephen Smith is a writer and broadcaster.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64513310
Sarah Huckabee Sanders to deliver State of Union Republican response,"Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the youngest governor in the US, will deliver the Republican response to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address. Mrs Sanders, 40, took the oath of office four weeks ago as the 47th - and first female - governor of the southern state of Arkansas. But she is best known for her tenure as press secretary to former President Donald Trump from 2017 to 2019. Her speech will come on the heels of Mr Biden's primetime address on Tuesday. Mrs Sanders is the youngest child of former Arkansas governor and two-time presidential candidate Mike Huckabee. She had a tumultuous White House tenure, in which she clashed frequently with members of the media, and faced personal attacks over her looks. She will speak from Little Rock, the state capital of Arkansas. She has promised to contrast her party's ""optimistic vision for the future against the failures of President Biden and the Democrats"". In her 10-minute speech, Mrs Sanders will criticise what she calls ""the radical left's America"" which - in her words - is characterised by ""high gas prices, empty grocery shelves"" and an education system in which ""our children are taught to hate one another on account of their race"". She will also criticise ""woke fantasies"" and ""a left-wing culture war"".   The BBC will be providing live updates and analysis throughout the evening here. The State of the Union has been delivered every year since 1790, except in presidential inauguration years, but the history of the opposition's response is far more brief. The first response came in 1966, after Lyndon Johnson upgraded the annual address from a daytime event to a primetime slot. Guaranteed a much bigger audience than initially expected, Republicans seized the moment and established a new tradition. Mr Biden is one of only four Americans to have delivered both the presidential address and the opposition response. Forty years ago, as the junior senator from Delaware, he participated in a 12-person Democratic Party response to Ronald Reagan. The rebuttal is often delivered by young rising stars in the opposition party and frequently from outside of Washington. Also delivering a response to President Biden's State of the Union, but in Spanish, will be Juan Ciscomani, a newly-elected lawmaker in the US House of Representatives from Arizona. The Spanish response, a sign of Latino voters' growing importance in the US electorate, has taken place on and off since 2004. Mr Ciscomani, 40, was born in Mexico and is the first foreign-born American elected to Congress from his state. He sits as part of the new Republican majority in the House, a change from Mr Biden's first State of the Union last year, which came under unified Democratic control of Washington. ""My message will be simple and straightforward: the American Dream is a dream worth fighting for,"" Mr Ciscomani said in a statement. ""The people of my district in Arizona and Americans across our country want accountability, responsibility and sensibility restored in our nation's capital."" During Mr Biden's tenure, others in his party have sought to make their voices heard during the primetime event. At last year's State of the Union, Democratic House lawmakers delivered responses on behalf of the Working Families Party (WFP), the Congressional Black Caucus and the No Labels group. The WFP, a minor political party that is closely allied with Democrats ideologically to the left of their party, will again field a response to the president this year - by Congresswoman Delia Ramirez of Illinois. Born to a Guatemalan mother who was pregnant with her when she crossed the US-Mexico border, Ms Ramirez, 39, is the first Latina elected to Congress from the Midwest region. Along with progressive firebrands like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, she is considered a member of ""the Squad"" in Congress. ""I will be laying out a vision for how Democrats can win working-class voters of all races and nationalities by fighting for a government that has working people's backs,"" Ms Ramirez wrote on Twitter.

Toxic gaming tackled by Ubisoft's unique police alert system,"Rape jokes, racism, bullying - if you've picked up a controller, or scrolled a mouse, to dabble in some online gaming then you've likely come across plenty. The gaming industry, like others where people interact online, has been trying to figure out how to get to grips with behaviour like this for years.  Ubisoft, makers of major franchises like Assassin's Creed and Rainbow Six, has now signed a first-of-its-kind deal with police to try and tackle the issue for its players. The hope is for this agreement to start a conversation within the industry and see others follow suit. Online gaming is a joyful experience for millions of people every day.  It's a space where friendships are forged and memorable experienced shared. During the pandemic online games were a saviour for many people's mental health. However its dark side is also plain to see.  Abusive behaviour, deaths threats and grooming - can be found in online gaming spaces.  ""We want to be on the right side of history,"" says Damien Glorieux a senior director of the Newcastle-based Ubisoft Customer Relationship Centre. It's here, and at four other locations around the world, that staff monitor how players of Ubisoft games are getting on - responding to requests for help and actively getting involved with the communities that have evolved around their titles. They deal with everything from purchasing issues to online toxicity.  Other companies have similar set-ups, but what's unique here is the involvement of local law enforcement.  The deal between the company and Northumbria Police works in two parts.  Firstly, it sees specialist officers share their knowledge and expertise on harmful online interactions with the 200-strong team working at the centre in Newcastle, who then apply that training to their daily work.  Secondly, an agreement is in place so that in extreme cases, where there is a threat to life or potential serious harm spotted, staff can fast track the information to police. They will then decide whether or not to act. Glorieux explains to BBC News: ""We have millions of players, and tens of millions of interactions - so how can we spot incidents?  ""It is daunting, but at the same time it is very important, which is why we wanted to sign this deal and try to make things right . ""We wanted to focus on the most extreme cases, make sure we do the right thing there because it gives us a solid foundation to build the rest of our work around."" Less than 0.01% of cases that the centre deals with end up requiring police intervention.  That works out as roughly a handful of cases a month. Most of the time, accounts will be temporarily banned or permanently closed if players have breached a code of conduct.  Staff in Newcastle can also recommend the company start legal proceedings in some instances. Andrew Holliday and his team deal with the cases that get close to, or reach, the threshold for police intervention: ""This isn't just a gaming problem, it's is an internet problem,"" he begins. ""There's a real appetite to make the whole ecosystem a better place. ""What we're working on closely with police on is triaging, you know, where we look at a case and decide - 'right is this is one we can deal with in-house? Or is this  something we need to pass on?'"" Gaming is global and some of the cases seen by staff here cross national borders.  Holliday tells us about a recent case in Norway, saying: ""Things were said and behaviours displayed that hit our threshold for intervention. There was a threat to life or serious harm. ""The agreement with Northumbria Police meant that after we flagged it, even though it wasn't a UK citizen - they were able to get Norwegian authorities involved. ""It was a lot quicker, more efficient and safer than trying to do it as a private citizen.""  Some of the staff here argue that the games industry has shied away from talking about the reality of online play for too long. They say it needs to be more open and proactive in talking about the steps being taken to tackle unpleasant, dangerous or threatening behaviour. For Northumbria Police, Detective Chief Superintendent Deborah Alderson has been leading the work with Ubisoft on this agreement. She argues that policing ""is about prioritising protecting the vulnerable"". ""That means all of our communities not just the ones that we see in person, but our online communities as well,"" she adds. ""Policing changes continually, demands evolve and we have different challenges all the time - our job is to evolve with it."" Deborah Alderson, whose son is a massive Fortnite fan, thinks work like this is vital, as more and more of our lives go online, and more and more people play,  She wants this arrangement to be replicated by games companies and other police forces across the UK, and is working with professor of police sciences, Dr Gavin Oxburgh of Northumbria University, to provide a blueprint for how it can be copied by others. The centre in Newcastle was founded in 2014, initially as a call centre to deal with player issues but its role has developed significantly since then.  The staff clearly care about their work and the agreement with Northumbria Police has been in the pipeline for some time.  However, as well as wanting to lead the conversation within the UK industry on tackling harmful online behaviour, there is also a compelling business case for focusing on customer relations. In an increasingly competitive market place, keeping people playing your games is harder than ever. They're more likely to stick around if they feel safe and listened to.  It's been a difficult few months for Ubisoft with games being cancelled and their financial forecast scaled-back. Keeping their player base happy is more important than ever.  Andy Millmoor is the player experience director at the centre, and says that when it comes to online behaviour, making people feel ""safe and secure"" is their number one goal. ""Toxicity takes a lot of different shapes,"" he says. ""The important things for us is when you're at home trying to have a good time and relax - our aim is to make sure you're doing that in a safe environment.  ""When someone wants entertainment they've got a whole host of things they can do, and if you had a bad experience, if someone's giving you a bad time online - you're just going to go to one of the other options.""   However Ubisoft is not alone, with the cost of living crisis likely to impact more gaming companies in the coming months - it may be another reason why more people in the industry take an interest in how this partnership works and develops. No-one who works in this field expects a quick fix to a problem that has plagued online life since its inception - but here is one companies attempt to make games joyous every time people press play.

Black Sabbath The Ballet to premiere in Birmingham in September,"Ballet and heavy metal may not be an obvious pairing, but that's the mash-up fans will be getting when Black Sabbath - The Ballet opens later this year. The brainchild of Birmingham Royal Ballet director Carlos Acosta and the band's Tony Iommi, the ballet will premiere in Birmingham in September. It will feature eight Black Sabbath tracks plus new music inspired by them. Iommi told Radio 4's Today he hopes the ""rags to riches"" tale will attract ""both our fans and ballet fans"". Acosta told the programme he had been a big fan of the band since a friend introduced him to their music around the year 2000. Following a week's run at the Birmingham Hippodrome from 23 to the 30 September 2023, the full-length three-act ballet will then tour to Plymouth's Theatre Royal and Sadler's Wells in London. In a press release announcing the production, guitarist Iommi said: ""I'd never imagined pairing Black Sabbath with ballet but it's got a nice ring to it!"" He added: ""I'm looking forward to seeing how this all develops. Black Sabbath have always been innovators and never been predictable, and it doesn't come any more unpredictable than this! I've met with Carlos several times and his enthusiasm is infectious."" The eight Black Sabbath tracks from the show include Paranoid, War Pigs, Orchid and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and the music will be re-orchestrated for the Royal Ballet Sinfonia.  The idea of a Black Sabbath ballet has been on Acosta's mind since he first arrived in Birmingham at the start of 2020, just before the pandemic hit.  Acosta said: ""Black Sabbath is probably Birmingham's biggest export, the most famous - and infamous - cultural entity to ever emerge from the city - so I was naturally drawn to the idea of a collaboration between what most people might think are the most unlikely of partners.  ""The band's enthusiasm for the project is a huge endorsement. They are putting their trust in us to deliver something completely new and original, and that's quite a responsibility but one that we are beyond excited to take on."" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the former ballet star said he had been a fan of the band for more than two decades, and said he felt their song War Pigs still has particular resonance. ""War Pigs is so relevant today, how sometimes politicians and governments hide behind words. And all the wars happening at the moment... it's timeless."" The Cuban-born dancer added that it was ""incredible"" to meet Iommi, who he described as ""a gentle soul"". ""We both come from poor working class backgrounds. The band came out of this hardship. They represented so many people."" Iommi told Today's Nicola Stanbridge the storyline will be a ""rags to riches"" tale and while he ""can appreciate"" ballet as an art form, he has never actually been to a ballet. Yet. ""I went down to see the rehearsal and they were dancing around me, it was fascinating. ""I think it's really adventurous to do this. It's hoping to attract both our fans and ballet fans."" The news comes a week after Black Sabbath's frontman Ozzy Osbourne announced he was retiring from performing. Osbourne told fans he was still struggling to recover from a spine injury he sustained in 2019. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-64544418
Fawlty Towers: John Cleese to revive series with daughter,"Comedy series Fawlty Towers is set to be revived after more than 40 years.  John Cleese, who played Basil Fawlty, will be returning to write and star alongside his daughter Camilla Cleese.  The two-series show, which featured on BBC2 in 1975 and 1979, followed the lives of Torquay hotelier Basil and his wife Sybil as they tried to keep their business and marriage afloat.  The new series will explore how the dramatic and cynical Basil navigates the modern world. Castle Rock Entertainment announced on Tuesday it had closed a deal with Cleese to bring back the television series.  The revival will also see Basil and a daughter he has just discovered is his, team up to run a boutique hotel.  Cleese is also well known as one of the original members of the Monty Python comedy group.  Fawlty Towers was named the greatest British sitcom of all time by a panel of television experts for Radio Times magazine in 2019.  The new series will see actor Rob Reiner, his wife and actress Michelle, director and producer Matthew George and Derrick Rossi act as executive producers.   Cleese said when he first met George ""he offered an excellent idea"" which led to ""one of the best creative sessions I can remember"".  ""By dessert we had an overall concept so good that, a few days later, it won the approval of Rob and Michele Reiner. ""Camilla and I look forward enormously to expanding it into a series.""  Director George said he was ""obsessed with Fawlty Towers"" and meeting Cleese and his daughter was ""one of the ""great thrills"" of his life.  ""I've watched the first two seasons so many times I have lost count.  ""I dreamed of one day being involved in a continuation of the story. Now it's come true."" Actor Reiner described the Fawlty Towers star as a ""comedy legend"". ""Just the idea of working with him makes me laugh."" In 2020, Cleese had a disagreement with the BBC after it temporarily removed a classic episode of Fawlty Towers because of ""racial slurs"".  The 1975 episode, called The Germans, featured the Major character using highly offensive language and Basil declaring ""don't mention the war"".  Cleese criticised the decision, saying: ""I would have hoped that someone at the BBC would understand that there are two ways of making fun of human behaviour. ""One is to attack it directly. The other is to have someone who is patently a figure of fun, speak up on behalf of that behaviour."" Streaming service UKTV temporarily removed the episode while it carried out a review, but it was reinstated with a warning about ""offensive content and language"".  The original show was written by Cleese and Connie Booth.  In October 2022, the Monty Python actor confirmed he would be hosting his own GB News TV show.

US sources insist Chinese balloon was military," US intelligence sources have insisted the balloon shot down on Saturday was used by the Chinese military for spying. Unnamed officials told the Washington Post they believed such balloons were used to collect intelligence on strategically relevant countries. Japan, India, Taiwan and the Philippines were among those countries.  Chinese officials have already denied using such balloons for surveillance. An official told the Washington Post that the US intelligence community believed some of the balloons were being flown from Hainan, a southern Chinese island that is home to a naval military base. Quoting an unnamed senior Biden administration official, CBS News confirmed that the US intelligence community believed the balloon was part, in its words, of an ""aerial surveillance program run by the People's Liberation Army out of Hainan"".  On Monday, the US briefed 40 allied countries about the alleged espionage, a senior Biden administration official confirmed to CBS News. In that briefing, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman also revealed one balloon had circumnavigated the planet in 2019, travelling over Hawaii and Florida. According to the Biden administration official, a group of US Congressional leaders responsible for overseeing national intelligence matters, known as the Gang of Eight, will be briefed on the development on Wednesday, and Congress will be updated on Thursday,  Last week, the Pentagon said a second Chinese spy balloon had been spotted over Costa Rica and Venezuela. The discovery of alleged spy balloons has caused a diplomatic row between the US and China.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken cancelled a trip to Beijing, set to take place just a few days after the balloon was first detected. It would have been the first meeting of its kind between the two countries in years. ""This is an unacceptable as well as an irresponsible action,"" he said. ""It's even more irresponsible coming on the eve of a long-planned visit."" US defence officials have previously said at least three suspected Chinese spy balloons flew over the country during Donald Trump's presidency.  And according to US officials, the balloon shot down had flown over Alaska and Canada before appearing in the US state of Montana, which is home to a number of sensitive nuclear missile sites. On Monday the US Navy released pictures of the debris of the balloon once it was shot out of the sky.  It was believed to have been nearly 200ft (60m) tall and officials said the debris spread over seven miles (11km) of Atlantic ocean. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64564549
US-China trade hits record high despite rising tensions,"Trade between the US and China hit a record high last year even as their diplomatic relations reach new lows. Imports and exports between the two countries totalled $690.6bn (£572.6bn) in 2022, official figures show. Tensions rose between Washington and Beijing in recent days after a Chinese balloon travelled across the US. The world's two biggest economies have been locked in a bitter trade war since 2018 when then-President Donald Trump started imposing tariffs on China. The new figures show that US imports from China increased to $536.8bn last year as American shoppers spent more on Chinese-made goods, including toys and mobile phones. In the same period, US exports to China increased to $153.8bn. While some of the increase in trade between the two countries is a result of the rising cost of living, the figures also point to how reliant the US and China still are on each other even after years of trade conflict between them. ""I think it's an important indication of the difficulties of actually decoupling,"" Deborah Elms, the founder of Asian Trade Centre, told the BBC.    ""Even if governments, firms and consumers wanted to separate, the economics make it difficult to deliver products in a decoupled world at a price that firms and consumers are willing to pay,"" she added. In 2018, the Trump administration started to ramp up trade measures against Beijing. After decades of rising Chinese imports, Mr Trump began imposing tariffs on a total of more than $300bn worth of Chinese goods. China hit back by placing import levies on about $100bn of American goods. Most of those measures remain in place more than two years after Joe Biden became president. This month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had been due to visit China in what was seen as a thawing of relations between the two country's. America's top diplomat was set to visit Beijing from 5 to 6 February to hold talks on a wide range of issues, including security, Taiwan and Covid-19. However, the trip was abruptly postponed after the discovery of a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that drifted across America.  Chinese officials have repeatedly said that the ""airship is for civilian use and entered the US due to force majeure - it was completely an accident"". In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, US President Joe Biden made no direct mention of the Chinese balloon but said that his administration will always protect its sovereignty. ""I am committed to work with China where it can advance American interests and benefit the world. But make no mistake: as we made clear last week, if China's threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did,"" he said. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64563855

Ukraine war: Borrowed time for Bakhmut as Russians close in,"The soil of Bakhmut is dusted with snow and soaked with blood. This small city in Eastern Ukraine is at the centre of an epic battle. For more than six months Russian forces have tried to claim it. Ukrainian troops have resisted, giving rise to the popular slogan here ""Bakhmut holds.""  Now the Russians are attacking from three sides, with regular troops and fighters from the notorious Wagner mercenary group. The Russians have reached one of the main highways into the city, and are closing in on the outskirts. There is house-to-house fighting in some areas on the outskirts, with ""hard battles for every home"" according to the Ukrainian military. It feels like Bakhmut is on borrowed time. If so, Ilya and Oleksii intend to use every second of it. The two Ukrainian National Guardsmen move swiftly and silently across open ground on the frontlines and then plunge into a trench.  Their camouflage backpacks contain weapons of war - a drone, a modified hand grenade, and a Velcro strap.  The German-made grenade had a tail fin attached, made with a 3D printer, to ensure it exploded on impact. Ilya - an IT guy turned intelligence officer - makes short work of velcroing the grenade to the drone. Then he launches it towards enemy forces nestled in their trenches, a kilometre and a half away.  ""We know there are a lot of Russian soldiers there, walking, living, and sitting,"" said Oleksii, the drone pilot. ""And so, we just give them [a] gift.""  ""The aim is not to kill a lot of soldiers but to make them afraid of our sky, to make them watch out every second. It's psychological pressure."" He shows us a drone's eye view as he releases the grenade over a frozen expanse. We can see the impact on his screen but can't tell if they were casualties below.  Oleksii says the fighting in Bakhmut is tough, emotionally and physically: ""It's hard, but we are staying here, and we will protect Bakhmut and the area around it as much as we can."" But Ukraine is counting the cost and there's speculation it could withdraw to avoid further heavy losses.   In the Kremlin, a clock is ticking - counting down to the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of its neighbour, on 24 February 2022. President Putin wants a victory before then. Taking Bakhmut would give him one, and bring him closer to his aim of capturing all of the mineral rich Donbas region. To reach Bakhmut you drive along winding back roads. The route we used for previous trips last September is now classed as ""suicidal"" because of constant Russian attacks. The city is now a shell. The thud of incoming and outgoing fire echoes through empty streets. Missiles have punched holes through buildings. Power and water supplies are long gone, along with most of the pre-war population of about 70,000.  But some families have remained here, with their children, sheltering in the shadows. Anna, who is seven, is a bright spark in an airless dark basement. Tiny gold earrings glint in her ears, her blonde hair is tied back in a ponytail, and she's wearing a pink sweater. Her colourful drawings line the walls but it still feels like a prison cell. Anna lives with her mother Yulia, grandfather Valery, two cats and Mushka the dog. She proudly shows us her favourite soft toys, but her blue eyes stand out against her pale complexion.  ""I sit in the cellar almost all day long,"" she tells me in a lilting voice. ""Outside I take Mushka for a walk, but she's afraid of these booms and constantly comes back. Only in the morning, when it is quiet at dawn, I can take her out."" Yulia sits in the gloom nearby, as Anna lists her friends who have already fled.  ""I miss them all,"" she says. ""Arina might be in Poland, Masha in Western Ukraine. Diana went somewhere else. Everyone left."" But Yulia is staying put with her daughter. ""Of course, I am worried,"" she tells me.  ""But I think it is more or less safe. At least we have everything here, everything is prepared. We think nowhere in Ukraine is safe and we have no means to go abroad."" Their basement shelter is well stocked with food and water, and they get regular deliveries from the White Angels, a unit of Ukrainian police who provide aid and carry out evacuations.  The team leader, Pavlo Dyachenko, lights up when he sees Anna. In the depths of war, they have forged a bond. He has brought Anna a new sleeping bag to keep her warm, but he would rather be getting her and her family out of the line of fire.  ""I don't understand why they are deciding to stay,"" he said. ""Bakhmut is under attack in the evening, in the morning, in the night. It's very dangerous with bombing and shelling all the time."" More thuds above ground amplify his point.  The shelling usually intensifies as midday approaches - part of the rhythm of warfare in Bakhmut. After exhausting overnight battles, troops on both sides sleep late into the mornings, before getting back to their guns.   We race out of the city and onwards through rolling hills that offer a commanding view of the area.  ""These heights are more important for the Russians than Bakhmut itself,"" said a Ukrainian colleague. ""If they can bring their artillery here, they can target bigger cities like Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. "" Bakhmut holds, for now, but for how much longer.

This is what real Americans thought of the State of the Union,"President Biden delivered his 2023 State of the Union address on Tuesday - the annual speech in which the US president sets out his agenda and tries to sell his accomplishments to the public. So what did Americans make of it?   Viewers around the country, with a range of political views, shared their candid thoughts with us as they tuned in.  While some said Mr Biden sounded measured and focused, others felt the speech fell flat in addressing big issues.  As for whether they wanted him to run for president again, there was unity across the aisle - but perhaps not the kind the president had hoped for... The speech in 3 words: Hollow, hopeful, platitudes I don't think that he was unconvincing, but there was nothing I heard in this speech that I believe would change anybody's mind about his presidency or his plans going forward. I really appreciated some aspects like discussion around the Inflation Reduction Act and infrastructure bill, and the support for Medicare and social security. Insulin caps, out of pocket expenses for seniors and all that are so important.  On a bit of a more personal note coming from someone who lives in Memphis - that was one of the most milquetoast responses to police violence and a murder by police that you could write up. More training and support staff for first responders is fine and all, but until we fundamentally restructure and regulate police, these things will keep happening. I don't want him to run [for the presidency in 2024]. First, on principle I think that he's too old. He has not demonstrated a strong, cohesive agenda that resonates with any large percentage of the country except ""vote blue, no matter who"" Democrats. Of course, he would be less bad than Trump or DeSantis, but is that what we should hope for in a president?  The speech in 3 words: Missed the mark It was a pretty rowdy crowd there tonight. They didn't sound especially united. What I heard was pretty random stuff from Mr Biden. Junk fees at resorts? I don't know that's ever been a critical worry for anyone. What I hear at work and in our community are concerns about inflation, drug overdoses, crime, and the escalating situation in Ukraine.  My first impression was that Mr Biden appeared a bit frail entering the chamber. I think the issue of advancing age may become a real liability if he decides to run again in 2024. I wouldn't be voting for him in the first place, but if I was a Democrat, I think I'd be looking for a younger, more coherent candidate. The world is a dangerous place right now and we need a president at the top of their game whatever political party they represent. The speech in 3 words: Measured, bipartisan, focused President Biden has accomplished quite a bit in his two years. The President inherited a country in the middle of a global pandemic and has successfully navigated the country out of it. He has been able to work across the aisle to accomplish goals. Looking at his record, the plan and strategy to improve the state of the country are clear.  President Biden has a special way of connecting to the regular person. His message was optimistic and strong. What this country has overcome is unifying. Right off the bat, he addressed a diverse collection of Americans and how his initiatives have helped them. And this is true, his achievements have helped a wide array of Americans.  While I believe he could successfully serve another term, I do not want him to run if the American people will not vote for him against a Republican nominee. Ultimately, he is past an acceptable age for a president by many Americans and that must be taken into account when deciding the Democratic nominee. The speech in 3 words: Divisive, extremist, demoralising The president painted a rosy picture of a country that has gone steeply downhill under his watch. Millions are suffering as a result of trillions in reckless spending rammed through Congress under his administration that has led to the worst inflation in decades, which disproportionately harms low-income Americans. He conveyed no coherent plan to address this issue, while brushing over topics where his administration has failed, and embarrassing himself on topics like the humanitarian border crisis that he has fuelled.  He peddled divisive anti-police rhetoric, dividing Americans by race. Does anyone in the US sincerely believe that we are less divided as a nation today than we were two years ago? I don't think so. I would like him to run in 2024, but only because I think he would lose. He has a historically low approval rating and low enthusiasm within his own party.  The speech in 3 words: Effective, patriotic, poignant I think Biden has accomplished more in two years than most presidents of recent years - the Infrastructure Deal, Chips deal, adding more jobs to the market and steering us through the pandemic. He was the perfect successor to the former president as he leads with actions over words, for the purpose of the American people, and with unity as the goal for the country. That said, I do not think he should run again. I believe he will be too old for a second term - as will Trump. Biden's love for America and its people was palpable. I am impressed with his accomplishments to date. He had this ability to evoke a sense of patriotism within me.   The speech in 3 words: Misleading, empty, unbelievable  Biden was not convincing that he has a plan. Most of what he said was all smoke and mirrors. On the surface what he says sounds good, but very few or none of the things he says will actually come to fruition. Absolutely nothing has improved since he took office. Inflation, gas prices, cost of living have gone up post-pandemic and most Americans are not better off than they were two years ago.  His attempt to unify is a joke. He can't say he is unifying when he takes jabs at Republicans and President Trump. A unifier would just stick to their own plan and say what they would do to implement it.  I don't think he should run again. He shouldn't have run in 2020. He's not mentally fit to be president.

SWAH: Concerns raised over future of maternity services,"Concerns have been raised about the future of maternity services at the South West Acute Hospital (SWAH) in Enniskillen during a public meeting. It followed a report in the Fermanagh Herald. The paper said several obstetrics and gynaecology consultants were planning to leave the hospital. A doctor told the newspaper the impending departures meant they were unsure if the service would be able to be sustained beyond May or June. A spokesperson for the Western Trust said six consultants were on the rota, which they said remained ""stable"". ""Preparations for recruitment are ongoing,"" they added. The assistant medical director described the rota as ""compliant and staffed"". The trust is carrying out a public consultation following the temporary withdrawal of emergency general surgery at SWAH. It said the hospital's emergency department and other services including maternity and cardiology would continue to operate as normal. Some obstetrics and gynaecology consultants, however, have raised concerns that the removal of emergency general surgery service would endanger their patients' safety. As part of the consultation process a public meeting was held on Tuesday night in Belcoo Community Centre. One member of the public asked Western Trust representatives: ""Are you suggesting that the surgeons and the consultants and the whistleblower today are wrong to have those concerns or are you saying something is being done to mitigate that risk?"" The Western Trust said it had put in place safety mitigations following a review by the regional representative of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The assistant medical director at SWAH, Prof Ronan O'Hare, said ""obstetrics continues today as does gynae surgery"".  He added that caesarean sections would continue to be carried out as they were not performed by general surgeons. ""Currently we have a compliant and staffed rota, a combination of substantive consultants and locums,"" he said. ""We are actively recruiting for consultants that have moved elsewhere, but the last round of consultants we did recruit for obstetrics and gynae."" Another member of the public said when going for routine gynae surgery a consent form lists potential complications, including a bowel perforation. ""Thankfully nothing happens, but I'm very aware that my gynae consultant would like to make sure that I am covered should this happen for routine gynae surgery,"" she said. ""I can understand gynae consultants' fears, I can understand their concerns at not having surgical backup.  ""I can also appreciate that it has been difficult to recruit general surgeons."" Prof O'Hare added that the decision for SWAH to be an elective overnight surgery centre would ensure a surgical presence who could be called upon ""for life and death emergencies"".  He said the hospital had five theatres, but two were empty as only three were currently commissioned and funded by the Department of Health.  ""So if we had those running and commissioned then we could have surgeons there the entire time to provide essentially the type of cover that you are suggesting and me and my colleagues also requested,"" he said. During the meeting a former special adviser to former Health Minister Robin Swann described the process regarding the suspension of emergency surgery as ""shambolic"". Mark Ovens, who lives with his young family in County Fermanagh, said the consultation had been ""terrible"" with mixed and contradictory messages.

Curlew: Record-breaking NI breeding season brings renewed hope,"There is renewed hope for one of Northern Ireland's most endangered birds after a record-breaking breeding season.   Sixty-nine curlew chicks were recorded at Glenwherry, County Antrim during 2022, said RSPB NI.   That is more than double the number that fledged from nests there in 2021.  The curlew is at risk of extinction in Northern Ireland within the next decade, with numbers declining by 82% since 1987.   Farmers and landowners have been given advice on habitat management to help support the ground-nesting species.   The number of curlews returning to breed in Glenwherry has declined in recent years.   Katie Gibb, RSPB NI's conservation officer for the area, said the 2022 results could mark a turning point.    ""What this season means is that in the next five years we could have over 30 new pairs return to the area to breed, which would be a massive and healthy influx of young, fertile, new genetics for this population,"" she said.   ""The number of chicks we have seen fledge this year is not just heartening, it is unequivocal proof that conservation and landscape-scale nature protection works, and should remain a priority in tackling the biodiversity crisis.""    Those protection works include helping farmers implement more nature-friendly practices through DAERA's Environmental Farming Scheme and support from projects like Curlews in Crisis.  Temporary electrified fences were installed around nest sites to protect the birds from ground predators. There were also targeted measures to control the number of other predators.   ""It really is a case of every chick counts when it comes to curlew in Northern Ireland,"" Ms Gibb said.   She said in the last year the team at Glenwherry had installed the highest number of targeted nest fences - which protect nesting chicks from predators - at a single site in the UK. ""The fences, and knowledge of the pairs gathered from previous seasons, have been a game-changer for curlew conservation on our site,"" she added. She described the increase in hatching rates, from about 40% to 70%, as marking ""a real turning of the tide for curlew conservation on the Antrim Plateau"".  Almost 8,000 hectares in the plateau, which include Glenwherry and the Antrim Hills, were surveyed to find the nests for monitoring.   In County Fermanagh, another 11 chicks were recorded as successfully leaving the nest at the Lower Lough Erne RSPB NI reserve, with four of the broods hatching on the same day on the same island. The charity's estate manager, Amy Burns, said there could be more, because the terrain of islands, scattered across the lough, is difficult to monitor accurately.   ""A total of 23 pairs of curlew were recorded hatching young this season in this area, with 18 nests located, 17 of which successfully hatched full clutches,"" she said.

North York Moors National Park seeks new authority members,"The North York Moors National Park needs two new members to sit on the authority's board. The 20 member organisation is responsible for major decisions such as planning and conservation. Applicants should be ""passionate and committed"" and will be chosen following interviews in March. The positions are unpaid, but an allowance and expenses are paid. Members are expected to commit two to three days a month to the role. Jim Bailey, chairman of the North York Moors National Park Authority, said it was a ""pivotal time"" for all protected landscapes. ""National Parks are extra special places for nature and biodiversity, but they are also living working environments with local communities and a rich cultural heritage."" In addition to making decisions about planning applications, conservation projects and grant schemes, members also act as ambassadors for the North York Moors. ""As a board we aim to make the best possible decisions regarding the direction of the National Park Authority, ensuring that money is well spent and always with great consideration for future generations,"" Mr Bailey added. Five of the 20 Members are appointed by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). A further four are selected by parish councils and the remaining 11 are drawn from the local authorities within the North York Moors. The two new members will be selected by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Thérèsa Coffey.

Northern Ireland Protocol: Supreme Court to deliver judgement,"The Supreme Court is set to deliver judgement on the lawfulness of the Northern Ireland Protocol. Part of the Brexit deal, the protocol creates a trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. It has been challenged by unionist politicians who say it breaches the Acts of Union and the Northern Ireland Act. Their arguments have previously been rejected by the High Court and Court of Appeal. The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU in 2019 to ensure free movement of trade across the Irish land border after Brexit. However, it means there are new checks and controls on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. In March 2022, the Court of Appeal found the Withdrawal Agreement Act, which includes the protocol, did conflict with the 1800 Acts of Union in respect of free trade between Britain and Northern Ireland. However, the court added that the Withdrawal Agreement lawfully modified the Acts of Union. The lady chief justice said the Acts of Union had not been repealed but one section, Article 6, now has to be read subject to the Withdrawal Agreement Act, which placed into law the arrangements for the protocol. The Court of Appeal also rejected the argument that the protocol had changed the constitutional status of Northern Ireland as defined in the Good Friday Agreement. Furthermore, the court found that the Northern Ireland secretary did have the power to change Stormont's usual cross-community voting mechanism. Normally, Stormont must approve controversial issues by a cross-community vote, but the protocol will be subject to a straight-majority vote. The court found the Northern Ireland secretary had the power to do this on two grounds: that it was necessary to reflect the will of Parliament in implementing the Withdrawal Agreement Act and that it concerned international relations, which is not a devolved matter. However, the court said there were legal points of public importance which merited consideration by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal in the UK for civil cases. It hears cases considered to be of the greatest public or constitutional importance affecting the whole population. A five-judge panel, including Lord Reed, the president of the court, heard the case over two days in November. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64558530
Rhona Malone: Cover-up claim over police review of sexism case,"A former firearms officer who won a pay-out of almost £1m from Police Scotland claims an external review following her tribunal smacks of a cover-up.   Rhona Malone said the review lacked independence and depth. It came after an employment tribunal found she was victimised after raising concerns about a sexist email.  The Police Service of Northern Ireland, which carried out the review, said it resulted in five conduct assessments. Meanwhile, Ms Malone also called for Chief Constable Iain Livingstone to resign, questioning what he knew about her case and when. Police Scotland responded by saying it was ""inaccurate and misleading"" to suggest the chief constable had not been honest about his knowledge of Ms Malone's case. The former firearms officer won the pay-out in May last year. In the days after the tribunal judgement Police Scotland asked the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) to carry out a review and make recommendations.  A redacted copy of the review was published in June 2022. The main section is critical of all the officers and staff who victimised Rhona Malone except for one - a chief superintendent who was in charge of the Professional Standards Department (PSD).  Ms Malone told the BBC she was ""really disappointed"" that the published sections did not cover his conduct nor the conduct of the PSD. Ms Malone said her initial reaction was: ""What are they trying to cover it up for?"" She said it raised issues around transparency and integrity. ""The Professional Standards Department are basically policing the police,"" she said. ""This is behaviour by senior police officers within Police Scotland and if they're not getting held accountable then how can police officers have faith to report anything."" Ms Malone instructed her solicitor to write to the justice secretary.  The letter states Ms Malone considered the appointment of the PSNI to carry out the review to be ""ill-judged, considering widespread media reports which suggested that sexist and misogynistic behaviours and cultures were systemic within policing"".  She added that ""her reservations about the PSNI conducting an independent, unbiased, and thorough review were well founded"".     Margaret Gribbon, Bridge Employment Solicitors, Glasgow, told the BBC that Police Scotland and PSNI had ""some significant questions to answer regarding this review"". She added: ""My client's legitimate concerns have not been addressed and it is concerning that it is being left to her to highlight unexplained irregularities in the review."" The BBC put Ms Malone's claims to the PSNI. A spokeswoman said: ""The PSNI were asked by Police Scotland to independently review the Employment Tribunal judgement only..."" She said Police Scotland's request to carry out a review ""did not involve an investigation into the original matters that led to the tribunal or a review of Police Scotland's Professional Standards department…"" ""The review did result in five conduct assessments of individuals who gave evidence in the tribunal. These assessments were provided to the chief constable of Police Scotland."" The BBC has been unable to verify whether one of the redacted conduct assessments did relate to the chief superintendent in question. Ms Malone met Chief Constable Iain Livingstone after the tribunal judgement was published.  She described the meeting as ""informative and productive"" but said Mr Livingstone gave her the impression he ""wasn't really that aware of her case"" before it went to tribunal. Several media outlets had covered Ms Malone's legal action in the months and years before. In November 2022 the BBC asked Police Scotland when the chief constable became aware of the detail of this case. A spokesperson said: ""The chief would not be aware of all the details or the personal impact to Rhona Malone in advance"" of the tribunal. The BBC has now seen two emails Ms Malone sent the chief constable more than a year earlier, detailing the personal impact on her. In one email to Mr Livingstone and others, in April 2020, she wrote: ""I now find myself mentally and physically ill"".  She also complains about a ""lack of transparency and obstructive behaviour"".  In a second email, in May 2020, she describes her ""utter hopelessness at the lack of regulation, accountability and the injustice"". When the BBC asked Ms Malone about the fact Mr Livingstone receives many emails and he might not have seen them or remembered them she said it was either ""incompetence or self-preservation"". She said if he didn't know about it, he should have. ""What does that tell you about what's happening in Police Scotland and the management of Police Scotland and how they look after their employees if he isn't made aware by my case (before the tribunal),"" Ms Malone said.  ""That's quite worrying."" Ms Malone said the chief constable should resign, adding ""I don't think he deserves to be in that job at all."" Deputy Chief Constable Fiona Taylor said: ""It is inaccurate and misleading to suggest the chief constable has not been honest about his knowledge of Ms Malone's case. She added: ""In the days after the judgment, Police Scotland made a public apology to Ms Malone and the chief constable commissioned the Police Service of Northern Ireland to carry out an independent review of the tribunal decision.  ""A meeting with Ms Malone in April 2022 was the first opportunity for the chief constable to meet her in person and to listen to her experience. During this meeting, the chief constable personally provided an unreserved apology for our poor response when a dedicated officer raised legitimate concerns."" Ms Taylor said a redacted copy of the PSNI's independent review of the tribunal judgment and an action tracker outlining Police Scotland's response were published in June 2022. ""The chief constable underlined his commitment to tackling sexism and outlined action being taken and further plans to address discrimination in society and our service in our Policing Together strategy, published in September 2022,"" she said. ""As part of this, we conducted an internal survey to listen to colleagues' experiences of sexism and misogyny as we build a service where everyone knows they are valued and welcome. ""Accordingly, it is utterly wrong to report that the chief constable has been untruthful about his knowledge of Ms Malone's case."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-64513654
Strike action: Heads advised only to close schools as last resort,"Principals have been told they should only close schools to pupils as a last resort when many teachers strike in Northern Ireland. The guidance came in a letter to school heads from the education management bodies. It also advises heads to organise remote learning for pupils if their school has to close. Teachers in three big unions - the NASUWT, INTO and UTU - are due to hold a half day strike on 21 February. The action, from midnight to 12:00 GMT, is due to continuing stalemate over a pay deal. But the NAHT union which represents many Northern Ireland school leaders has decided not to join the strike. The chief executive of the Education Authority (EA), Sara Long, has written to principals about arrangements for the day of the strike.  Her letter is on behalf of the employing bodies, including the EA, Department of Education (DE) and Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS). ""Given the large numbers of teachers who are members of the trade unions that are taking action, it is anticipated that this will cause significant disruption,"" Ms Long wrote. She has advised principals to carry out a risk assessment to decide what to do on the day of the strike, but to open their school all day if it is ""safe"" to do so. But if it is not safe due to a lack of staff, schools are to open at 12:00 GMT. ""If necessary as a last resort, close the school to all pupils but open for all staff not on strike for the full day and have arrangements in place, prior to half term, for pupils to engage in remote learning,"" her letter continues. Heads are also asked to try to find out in advance which staff will be on strike, although staff are not legally required to say in advance if they will be taking action. Ms Long also warned that although school transport would operate as normal on 21 February, it was ""not feasible"" to bring pupils to school at 12:00 GMT. Heads are asked to consider providing remote learning for pupils who cannot get to school in the afternoon. ""Consider a hybrid model for the delivery of the curriculum in the afternoon if some pupils are in school but others are unable to travel to attend,"" Ms Long wrote. The decision to open or close a school on the 21 February is down to the school principal. Ms Long's letter asks them to give parents and pupils as much notice as possible of what is likely to happen. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64561569
NI Assembly: Chris Heaton-Harris to extend election deadline again,"The deadline to hold an assembly election if there is no executive formed looks set to be further extended by the Northern Ireland secretary, BBC News NI understands  Chris Heaton-Harris is under a legal obligation to hold a poll by mid-April. However it is believed he is planning to bring forward legislation to push back the timeline  He is also under pressure to amend the legislation to ensure the stalled opt-out organ donation law is introduced  It is understood the bill - the Executive Formation Bill - could be tabled in the House of Commons as early as 22 February. When asked to confirm the date for the legislation, the Northern Ireland Office said the Northern Ireland secretary would provide ""an update on the next steps in the near future"". Mr Heaton-Harris has been under a legal duty to call a fresh assembly election since mid-January after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) failed to end its boycott of the Northern Ireland Executive. The party withdrew its first minister Paul Givan from the executive in February 2021 in protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol part of the Brexit deal and has not returned. Under the timeline laid out in law, the last date an assembly election could be held was 13 April which meant the Northern Ireland secretary had to call the poll before 6 March to allow for the six-week election campaign. The Northern Ireland Office refused to confirm or deny the plans for new legislation. A spokesperson said: ""On 20 January, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland fell under a legal duty to propose a date for further elections to the NI Assembly.  ""He has since engaged widely across Northern Ireland and will provide an update on next steps in the near future."" When the new legislation is published it may also include an amendment to clear the way for the introduction of the new opt-out organ donation law - popularly known as Dáithí's Law. It is believed the Northern Ireland secretary is coming under pressure from Northern Ireland MPs at Westminster to push the law through  It was approved by assembly members in February 2022 and was due to take effect this spring, but has been held up due to the stalemate at Stormont. The law is to be named after Dáithí MacGabhann, a six-year-old who is waiting for a heart transplant. His parents met Mr Heaton-Harris recently to ask for the new law to be brought through Westminister  They also met DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who told them the quickest way to implement Daithi's Law was through the House of Commons  But Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said the easiest way to introduce the new organ donation system was through the executive and called for the DUP to return to Stormont.

Hexham auctioneer to quiz MPs over lamb imports,"A livestock auctioneer is heading to Westminster to raise his concerns about ""worrying"" levels of lamb meat being imported from New Zealand. Jack Walton, from Northumberland, said supermarkets are stocking ""a hell of a lot"" of imported frozen meat. The 25-year-old said British farmers were already struggling in the face of rising running costs. The National Sheep Association are due to speak to members of the House of Lords and supermarket bosses. Jack, who chaired his first auction aged 14, is from a family of tenant farmers that has been involved in livestock sales for generations. Auctioning up to 10,000 sheep every market day Hexham and Northern Marts, he has been in his dream job for more than three years. ""It's a great line of work. You're in charge of a big crowd of people creating a bit of theatre. What more could you want?"" However, he fears for his future. ""The big problem in the sheep industry is that the supermarkets are buying a hell of a lot of New Zealand lamb,"" Jack said.  ""There's thousands of sheep available which would supply our supermarkets but I guess it's cheaper for them to ship it frozen in a boat for 13 weeks across here.  ""I don't understand how that can be sustainable. ""It's demoralising. I'll stand there and try and persuade buyers to buy sheep and I know for a fact the farmers aren't making any money."" Jack is also concerned about a lack of interest from the younger generation and the financial hardship facing farmers. His family are also preparing for the arrival of new lambs but to minimise costs they are doing the lambing themselves. ""It's hectic, it's a 24-hour job,"" he said. ""If we get two to three hours of sleep a night that's pretty good going"". He added: ""There's not masses of us getting involved in the industry nowadays, it's a bit of an aging population. ""I was on a farm where a young lad handed his notice in because he realised how tough the job is - working on a hill farm, not seeing people for days and having to put up with it."" ""I'm away down to Westminster to discuss why we need to support British sheep farmers and also look at why on earth it's sustainable to be shipping meat across to this country."" Meetings are due to take place throughout Wednesday. The National Sheep Association's next generation co-ordinator Katie James said the trip was a ""key opportunity"". ""Our meeting with several Lords, MPs and Defra representatives and then also with influential retailer M&S gives the young sheep sector representatives a unique opportunity to explain the concerns they have for their futures working in the industry.  ""Decisions made in London influence the next generation of our farmers more than most and so it is these young people that can help to shape that future with opportunities such as this meeting.""

NHS cancer bus tour due at Barnsley market,"A special bus tour designed to raise awareness of cancer is due in Barnsley later. Organised by NHS England the bus is visiting areas with some of the lowest early cancer diagnosis rates. NHS staff and Cancer Research UK nurses will be on the bus and they are able to give people information about the common signs and symptoms of cancer. Health Secretary Steve Barclay said early diagnosis was the ""best way to improve patient outcomes"". The NHS Bus-ting Cancer tour is due to be at Barnsley Market from 10:00 GMT until 16:00 after visiting Blackburn and Sunderland. It will move on to Leicester and London later in the week.

Mental health trust to introduce single-sex wards,"A number of psychiatric wards in Somerset and Wiltshire will become male or female only spaces under new plans. The changes will be made at sycamore ward at Bath Royal United Hospital, as well as wards in Swindon and Salisbury. It comes after a recent Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection recommended single-sex wards were needed to improve sexual safety. Avon and Wiltshire NHS mental health partnership said patient safety would always remain its ""top priority"". At the moment, the wards all care for men and women aged between 18 and 65 with severe mental health problems - many of whom have been sectioned. The change to the wards being used for only male or only female patients would mean some patients having to go further away from home for treatment. A member of staff who works on one of the affected wards contacted BBC Radio Somerset and said many of the staff were worried about the proposed changes. They said they felt patients should be based as close to their home as possible so they could receive visitors and spend some time at home when appropriate. They also claimed that challenging conditions, which might be more present in one of the sexes, would be concentrated at one inpatient ward - making it harder for the staff working there.  Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust said it currently had two single-sex wards in Bristol but none in Bath, Swindon or Wiltshire. ""During a recent inspection by the quality regulator CQC, it was pointed out that the trust is required to offer admission to a single gender ward for people who are sexually vulnerable,"" a spokesperson said. ""The trust is therefore considering how best to resolve this issue on a temporary basis until such time as the trust can reconfigure its wards on a permanent basis,"" they added.

Hill Crest in Redditch, run by Herefordshire and Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust, was visited in July after multiple issues were raised. During the unplanned visit, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) found a ""significant deterioration"" in ""safety and quality"" on the ward. The trust apologised and said it was taking steps to improve care. Claims reported to the CQC included incidents of staff asleep on duty and a culture of bullying. A BBC investigation previously found a male patient's jaw had been broken by another service user. Mixed-gender 18-bed Hill Crest ward supports people between 18 and 65 with acute mental health difficulties, and those detained under the Mental Health Act. Craig Howarth, CQC's deputy director of operations in the Midlands, cited an incident during which a patient had attempted to throw boiling water and sugar at a member of staff. ""On the day of inspection, two boilers were still in use indicating that lessons had not been learned following this incident and no actions had been taken to mitigate any future risk,"" he said. Other key findings included: Inspectors heard male patients regularly entered a female-only lounge without being challenged by staff, the report said. According to staff, a door between male and female areas was kept open with a towel over the handle. The BBC has previously heard reports of staff resigning after violent attacks on the ward. The CQC report detailed high vacancy rates, with seven out of 10 nursing posts, and seven out of 18 healthcare assistant roles unfulfilled. Workers reported ""staffing issues"" had left them under pressure, and they did not always feel respected or supported by managers. The ward could not guarantee high numbers of bank and agency nurses were familiar with the hospital or patients, inspectors said. In response, the trust said it had made immediate improvements to environment, risk assessment and handover procedures since the inspection, but personnel remained an issue. Chief executive Sarah Dugan said: ""We recognise that the standards of care and professionalism at Hill Crest at the time of the inspection last July were not good enough.  ""I would like to apologise to the patients and families concerned."" Ms Dugan said there were still ""significant staffing challenges which affect our ability to embed and sustain these improvements"". A temporary reduction to 10 beds would ""help alleviate the pressures"", she added. ""It will also help us focus on continuing to implement our improvement plan and sustain the changes that we are making."" The trust said it would work with other inpatient wards and community teams to ensure patients could continue to access care. It submitted its action plan to the CQC on 5 September.

New £110m Countess of Chester Hospital building approved,"Plans for a new building at the Countess of Chester Hospital have been given the go ahead. The new building will house the women and children's service, as the current site of the service is constructed from a material which has been deemed as at risk of collapse and needs to be removed. NHS England has provided £110m for the construction of the new building. But there were some concerns over parking plans for the site. The current women and children's service is based in a 1970s building constructed out of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete, which has been identified as at risk of sudden collapse and needs to be removed by 2030. The proposals include the construction of a three-storey building and a temporary car park to compensate for the loss of parking during construction. But there were some concerns ahead of and during the Cheshire West and Chester Council planning meeting where the scheme was signed off. The local parish council said although it did not object to the development and improvement of local healthcare facilities, ""this is not the way to do it"". It raised concerns about parking and impact on the green belt, due to the development of the temporary car park. Meanwhile, local councillor Jill Houlbrook said that parking had been a ""huge and contentious issue for 30 years"". Councillor Peter Rooney, who told the committee he spent 20 years working at the hospital in charge of the car park, proposed the committee accept the plans. ""Physically, there is nowhere else for this building to go and there is no space for a car park,"" he said. ""It does need to be replaced with a modern building for the generations to come"". The plans were approved, by six votes for to three against. Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Australia blocks coal mine to protect Great Barrier Reef,"For the first time in history, Australia has blocked the creation of a coal mine under environmental laws. The government on Thursday rejected a proposal for a new mine about 10km (6.2 miles) from the Great Barrier Reef. Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said the project posed an unacceptable risk to the World Heritage area, which is already highly vulnerable. The mine's owner, the controversial Australian billionaire Clive Palmer, has not yet responded to the rejection.  His firm, Central Queensland Coal, had proposed to build an open-cut mine about 700km north-west of Brisbane, that would produce both thermal and coking coal and operate for about 20 years. Ms Plibersek had last year flagged that the federal government might block the mine. After opening it to public consideration, her department received more than 9,000 submissions in 10 days - the majority calling for the project to be stopped. The Great Barrier Reef - the world's largest coral reef system - has suffered four mass bleachings in the past six years due to rising sea temperatures and its outlook is ""very poor"", authorities say. The Queensland state government had last year also recommended their federal counterparts reject the proposal, saying the environmental risks were ""significant"". Minister Plibersek's department agreed, finding sediment and run off from the open-cut mine was likely to damage the Reef and local water resources. ""I've decided that the adverse environmental impacts are simply too great,"" the minister said in a video statement on Wednesday. While state governments have rejected proposals before, it is the first time a federal Environment Minister has used their powers to do so. Australia's Labor government - elected in May - has been under pressure from some quarters to block any future coal and gas mining projects. The country cannot help to stop catastrophic climate change - or keep global warming below a 1.5C increase this century - if it allows new mines, environmental advocates like the Greens political party say. Australia is a major global supplier of fossil fuels. When exports are factored in, the country accounts for producing 3.6% of the world's emissions, but with only 0.3% of the world's population. While the new government has significantly increased Australia's 2030 emissions reduction target, it has also said it will approve any new fossil fuel projects that make commercial sense.

Unlawful trade barrier warning over deposit return scheme,"A leading lawyer has claimed that Scotland's deposit return scheme could create an unlawful trade barrier with the rest of the UK. The initiative is due to launch in August and is designed to boost recycling via a 20p deposit on single-use drinks bottles and cans. But Aidan O'Neill KC said the Scottish government may have to delay it until the launch of a UK-wide scheme in 2025. He made the remarks in advice sought from a group of distillers. The BBC has contacted the Scottish government for comment. Critics of the scheme in the drinks industry have voiced concerns that it will disrupt trade, create higher prices and reduce choice. Under the initiative every drinks producer based in Scotland will have to add 20p to products to be sold in the country in a single-use container. It will be charged to the retailer who will in turn bill the consumer. In order to recoup this money people need to take the empty bottles or cans to a reverse vending machine in a supermarket or designated return point. A total of 17,000 return points have to be set up across Scotland, with the scheme due to go live on 16 August.  In a legal opinion, Mr O'Neill said he believed there were ""well-founded"" concerns that the scheme would create a trade barrier between Scotland and England as it would require different prices to be charged for the same product on each side of the border.  He said expert economic evidence would be required to confirm this, but that it meant the scheme could contravene the UK Internal Market Act 2020. Mr O'Neill also warned that the regulations could not be enforced for single-use packaged drinks imported into Scotland from elsewhere in the UK, which would disadvantage Scottish producers.  He said this should ""not come as any surprise to the Scottish government"" as the Scottish Parliament was warned about such potential legal difficulties in a 2020 briefing paper by a University of Cambridge law professor.  The UK government said its preference would be to launch a UK-wide deposit return scheme as it would ""minimise disruption to the drinks industry and ensure choice for consumers"". A spokesperson added: ""As the Scottish government is pressing ahead with their own deposit return scheme, the UK government is working with them to ensure as much interoperability as possible between the schemes across the UK.""

New Zealand drug bust: Batman-labelled cocaine haul seized at sea,"New Zealand's navy has intercepted a floating haul of cocaine in the Pacific Ocean in what the country says is its largest drug bust ever. The stash - weighing total 3.2 tonnes (3,200kg) and worth NZ$500m (£263m; $316m) - was found drifting hundreds of kilometres northwest of New Zealand. Police believed it was destined for Australia, where it would have been enough to serve that market for a year. The packages were strung up with buoys and some labelled with a Batman symbol. Pictures released by New Zealand police and defence officials also showed cocaine packets labelled with a clover leaf symbol. ""This is the largest find of illicit drugs by New Zealand agencies, by some margin,"" said New Zealand's police commissioner Andrew Coster on Wednesday. ""It is more than New Zealand would use in 30 years,"" he added. New Zealand's navy deployed a vessel to retrieve the massive shipment last week, which comprised 81 bales of cocaine. They were brought to Auckland in New Zealand's North Island on Tuesday and taken to a security facility to be documented and destroyed, officials said.  ""We believe we have dealt a significant blow to an international criminal syndicate's operation,"" Mr Coster said. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64565454

Kaylea Titford: Experts questions how she 'dropped off radar',"How a teen ""dropped off the radar"" before her death has been questioned by a child protection expert.  Kaylea Titford, 16, who had spina bifida died in ""squalor"" at her Newtown, Powys, home in October 2020.  David Niven said it was ""ironic"" her mother Sarah Lloyd-Jones, 40, was a carer and called dad Alun Titford, 45, ""a lazy waste of space"". Lloyd-Jones admitted gross negligence manslaughter, while Titford was found guilty after a trial.  A spokesman for Powys County Council said a child practice review would be carried out by the local authority and involve all relevant agencies following a clear statutory framework. Mr Niven said Kaylea ""completely slipped through the cracks"", adding: ""The number of people who would have been involved with a 16-year-old girl, who had a severe impairment and was known, and then suddenly dropped off the radar.  ""I think there was somebody along the line who could have pushed a button."" Kaylea weighed almost 23st (146 kg) when she died.  Mr Niven questioned if anybody in the community could have noticed any warning signs, on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.  ""Were there extended family? Were there neighbours? Did she talk to people on social media? She certainly talked to the school, even if she didn't attend it, the medics must have been providing something for her spina bifida,"" he said.  ""Effectively, there were plenty of people in the community, given her involvement beforehand, who could have at least said 'has anybody talked to, seen or visited Kayley?'"" Mr Niven said during the pandemic ""presumably nobody was going into the house"" and ""nobody was saying this is a child at risk"". ""At any one moment, if any agency who was closer to Kaylea like police, medics or her school, they could have made a referral to social services at any time, and I don't believe they did,"" he said.  Mr Niven was asked what could be done to stop similar cases happening again, and replied: ""You don't, I'm afraid to say bluntly, but we can improve things. ""Maybe there won't be any particular person to blame here except the parents, I don't know, but certainly there is quite a lot to be reminded about and learned.  ""At the end of the day, we must remember that children can't always speak for themselves."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64566170

Turkey earthquake: The false and misleading images shared online,"Within hours of the earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria, false and misleading content began circulating online. Pictures and video from previous disasters in other countries were shared by people with claims that they showed damage caused by Monday's tremors.  We've looked at some of the most viral examples. One tweet - from a verified Twitter user - claimed to show a nuclear plant exploding, due to the earthquake in Turkey. The video got more than 1.2 million views.  The tweet also said ""Not confirmed, is this real?"". It wasn't.  Running the images through a search engine to see if they had appeared online before, revealed that they were actually from the aftermath of the Beirut explosion in August 2020, which resulted in the deaths of at least 200 people. Twitter later added a note underneath the tweet, clarifying its actual origin.  In the early hours of Monday, a video claiming to show a building collapse in Turkey was shared online, racking up more than a million views on Twitter.  However, a search of key frames from this video on Google revealed the clip actually shows the deadly Surfside condominium collapse in Florida in June 2021, footage of which was widely shared at the time.  British-Iranian comedian Omid Djalili shared a video on his Twitter account of what he claimed was a ""tsunami after the earthquake hit the coast of Turkey"". It has been viewed nearly 300,000 times. The video shows a huge wave washing away buildings next to a beach, as people run for their lives.  But, again, taking screenshots of the footage and searching for them on the internet revealed the clip actually dates back to September 2018 and was from Indonesia. It showed the aftermath of a 7.5-magnitude quake which struck off the island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that damaged the coastal city of Palu. After people pointed this out to him, Mr Djalili tweeted again to say, ""I understand this was NOT Turkey yesterday ...tweeted emotionally late night from usually reliable sources."" A different post on Twitter showed a video with scaffolding from a high-rise building falling to the ground.  The tweet falsely claimed that this was caused by the earthquake in Turkey and was shared across multiple platforms and garnered hundreds of thousands of views.  This video was in fact from an incident in Japan in 2016.  It was posted by the same user who posted the Beirut blast pictures.  An image of a dog lying on top of rubble, with its paw next to a hand sticking out of the debris, was shared in the aftermath of the quake, accompanied with the caption ""heartbreaking photo of the day"" and a Turkey hashtag.  The image has been viewed more than 1.4 million times so far. But a reverse image search using the freely-available Google Lens technology leads to the exact same photo on a stock image website, captioned ""Dog looking for injured people in ruins after earthquake"". The website says the image was taken on 18 October 2018, proving it has no link to the earthquake this week.

Turkey earthquake: Syrian man in Derry fears for missing family,"A Syrian man living in Londonderry has said family members are missing after huge earthquakes hit Turkey and Syria. Rescue teams in both countries are desperately working to find survivors following Monday's earthquakes. A crowd, including people from the local Turkish and Syrian communities, gathered in Derry's Guildhall Square for a vigil on Tuesday. Mohammed Ouathachi, who is originally from Damascus, has lived in Northern Ireland now for three years.  Mr Ouathachi is among many Syrians in Northern Ireland anxiously awaiting news from family and friends caught up in the disaster. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle, Mr Ouathachi said they have lost contact with his wife's cousin who was living in the Turkish city of Antakya when the earthquakes struck. ""We lost her with her family, she has four children and a husband,"" Mr Ouathachi said.  ""I hope we can find her, but up until now we cannot find her, so the situation is a real tragedy and my wife and I are so sad.""  Mr Ouathachi said rescue efforts are continuing in Syria, but it is a race against time and their country needs more support from the world.  ""In my country, the situation it is very complicated,"" he said.  ""I hope we can do something about this, we need more support to north Syria."" More than 9,000 people are known to have been killed in Turkey and Syria following Monday's earthquake. The number of people killed in Turkey has risen to 6,957, according to the country's disaster agency. It is difficult to verify the number in Syria, but its state media and a rescue group say about 2,500 people have died. Monday's 7.8 magnitude quake struck at 04:17 (01:17 GMT) near the city of Gaziantep. A later tremor was nearly as big, with its epicentre in the Elbistan district of Kahramanmaras province. You can follow live updates from Turkey and Syria over on the BBC's live page. Mahmood Khello, who is originally from Syria and now also lives in Derry, said the rescue efforts in Syria are very challenging.  ""I am feeling very bad, they need help and they need aid,"" he said.  ""I have two uncles in Syria, I called back yesterday and they said it is very dangerous, it is very cold, rain and it is a very difficult time.""  Rescuers in both countries have spent a second freezing-cold night searching for survivors under the rubble. Crowds cheered as a family of two adults and four children were pulled from rubble in Idlib, Syria by the White Helmets rescue group, which operates in rebel-controlled areas. Sameh Hassan from the North West Islamic Association said the vigil at the city's Guildhall on Tuesday was an opportunity to show that the people in the north west stand with the people in Syria and Turkey.  ""At this difficult time it is important to get together and show solidarity,"" Mr Hassan said.  He said it is important that governments around the world respond to the level of devastation in both countries in terms of aid and deliver it as soon as possible.  A book of condolence for the lives lost in the tragedy will be opened by mayor of Derry and Strabane Sandra Duffy later on Wednesday.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64565630
Turkey earthquake: Long journeys to find family,"As he waited for a delayed flight out of Istanbul Airport this week, Samet Yilmax held up his phone, pointing to a photo of rubble. He said his brother, Ismail, was buried beneath it. Samet lives in Bahrain, but has joined scores of people making the journey to southern Turkey in the wake of a huge earthquake that has killed thousands.  Like others, he believes that he is more likely to find his missing brother if he sifts through the rubble himself. Ismail, a 26-year-old supermarket cashier, had been staying with relatives in Hatay province on the Syrian border at the time of the earthquake.   Others, including his brother-in-law, were pulled from the remains of the building later that day, but Ismail has not been found, Samet said. ""I'm missing him so much. I have come from Bahrain to Turkey to search for him. He's my one and only brother,"" he told the BBC. Samet described Ismail as intelligent and ""shy with girls"". He said he was desperate for good news, but felt there was ""no help"" with the search. After arriving in Turkey, Samet waited for hours in Istanbul for a flight to take him to Adana in the south of the country, before beginning the hours-long drive to Hatay province. ""It's so cold here. Life is difficult,"" he said by WhatsApp message late on Tuesday night after arriving in the province, which has been devastated by the earthquake. With nowhere to stay, he warmed himself by a fire through the night, as he waited for daylight so he could begin the search for Ismail. Samet is not alone. The BBC has spoken to people from across Turkey and abroad who have been travelling down to areas hit by the earthquake to search for missing loved ones.  In the city of Antakya, men armed with pickaxes and crowbars sifted through the rubble of a fallen building on Tuesday, looking for survivors. They told the BBC they were family members of the building's residents and had come from Istanbul to search for their relatives.  Medical student Aylin Pulat could not get hold of several members of her family, including her parents, after the earthquake struck. She is based in Mugla, more than 1,000km (620 miles) from her family home in Adiyaman. With no news on her family's fate, she took a four-hour bus trip, a two-hour flight and a more than two-hour drive back to her home city to find out if they were alive. To her great relief, she arrived to find that her siblings and parents had survived. But 20 other relatives had died. ""When I arrived, I saw so much of the city was destroyed and there was no safe place for people to get shelter,"" she said. ""The only relief I got was to see that almost all of my [immediate] family were safe. I wasn't sure before getting there. ""When I found them, they were all dressed in pyjamas and that's how I knew they had escaped with nothing. We all just froze."" She said she could hear noises from some fallen buildings, but that rescue efforts were being left largely to residents of the city. ""People are just waiting helplessly to reach their loved ones under the rubble. We need support here as soon as possible."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64567295

"NI Assembly: £44,000 a month spent on TV services","The cost of TV broadcasting services at Stormont is £44,000 a month even though the assembly has been effectively shut since February 2022, BBC NI's Nolan Show has revealed. A contract began in July 2022, shortly after the DUP refused to nominate a speaker and when Stormont was closed. The Assembly Commission said the system must be maintained and kept ready. It said it has always had a contract for the operation and maintenance of broadcasting sound and vision services.  Political commentator Brendan Mulgrew told the Nolan Show on Wednesday that the situation was ""baffling"". ""The fact that it was signed up to when Stormont was down with no prospect of it coming back is very hard to understand,"" he said. ""We live here with political stalemates - rows, suspensions - so why would this contract have been entered into without some sort of clause?"" Mr Mulgrew acknowledged that it was important to be prepared, should Stormont return. ""Yes we do need to be in a state of readiness,"" he said. ""But I do think that a wee bit of imagination could have been employed at the time when the contract was drawn up, tendered for and awarded."" Former Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik took the opposite view calling the fee ""pretty good value"" at £44,000 a month. ""Financially, to get rid of this and try and reinstate it afterwards could be far more expensive,"" he said. ""Everybody agrees that their (the tv broadcasting company) quality of service is superb and it is hard to find that quality of service. ""This company can't sit around, they have to pay their staff. It would be a false economy and it would be practically dangerous to get rid of them."" In a statement to the Nolan Show, the Assembly Commission said it has always had a contract for the operation and maintenance of broadcasting sound and vision services and the current one runs for six years. ""Statutory responsibilities necessitate that plenary sittings and committee meetings are broadcast, streamed and recorded,"" the statement said. ""Since May 2022, there have been five recall plenary sittings and the chamber has also been used for tributes to her late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, tributes to the late Lord Trimble and to hold a sitting of the Youth Assembly. ""The assembly has not been dissolved and it could be recalled and begin normal working immediately.

West Midlands Police told it must house 44 prisoners in custody cells,"The government has told a police force to house more than 40 inmates in custody cells, its police and crime commissioner (PCC) said. West Midlands PCC Simon Foster said the ""remarkable"" request was because of jail overcrowding and the move would put extra strain on police officers. Custody units were not meant to handle prison inmates, The Labour PCC added. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said it would help to manage the ""short-term pressure"" on prison places. Last year the government announced it had asked to use 400 cells, following a surge in overcrowding in male prisons and youth jails. On Monday, the MoJ gave the National Police Chiefs' Council 14 days to make cells in the north of England and the West Midlands available, following a rise in the number of inmates since the start of the year. Mr Foster said: ""The public want their police officers out in communities preventing and tackling crime, not having to double up as prison officers because this chaotic government has failed to get the basics right and has failed to plan.""   He added the fact officers would be asked to look after 44 prisoners would put an extra strain on the force, which was 1,000 officers down on the number it had in 2010.  An MoJ spokesperson said: ""We have given notice to the National Police Chiefs Council to make available cells in police custody suites in the North of England and West Midlands as planned under Operation Safeguard. ""This will help ensure we have enough spaces to manage the short-term pressure on prison places - driven in part by the impact of the barristers' strike and Covid pandemic. ""We are building 20,000 extra prison places and our newest prison is set to open in the spring."" In November justice minister Damian Hinds said there was a ""highly unusual"" surge of more than 800 prisoners over two months.  Mr Hinds has described Operation Safeguard as an ""established protocol"", which has been used before in periods of high demand. He said England and Wales had ""not run out of prison places"" and the emergency measures did not reflect a failure to plan ahead. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Police said it was part of an investigation into an organised crime group and followed searches earlier in the day.

Health services for women in Highlands to be reviewed,"NHS Highland is reviewing women's health services in Caithness, Health Secretary Humaz Yousaf has said. Campaigners have been calling for improved provision of obstetrics and gynaecology. Women in Caithness and parts of Sutherland can face round trips of 210 miles (338km) or more to get to Inverness to access the services. Members of North Highland Women's Wellbeing Hub (NHWWH) met Mr Yousaf this week. Women's and Public Health Minister Maree Todd, who is also the local SNP MSP, along with representatives from Scottish government health teams and NHS Highland also attended the meeting. Mr Yousaf said: ""We had a very productive meeting, with various concerns raised and discussed. ""As NHS Highland's review of women's services gets under way, the board has committed to engaging with the Hub throughout the process and I will get regular updates as this continues."" NHWWH said a constructive approach to finding solutions was discussed during the meeting.  A spokeswoman said: ""All parties listened and took on board our concerns around diagnostics, operations, emergency care, access to care and travel. ""A review into gynaecology services in NHS Highland is now in the planning stages."" For years there have been calls for increased provision of obstetrics and gynaecology, services focused on the care of pregnant women and unborn babies and women's sexual and reproductive health. In 2016, the maternity unit at Caithness General in Wick was downgraded from consultant-led to midwife-led. Most first-time mothers are sent to Inverness' Raigmore Hospital for births. NHWWH said gynaecology and sexual health services had become increasingly centralised. It said emergency gynaecology care and surgical service were not available locally. It also claimed a consultant had only been available 31 weeks of the year in 2021-22 and that 12% of gynaecology procedures were carried out at Caithness General. NHS Highland said it was in regular contact with NHWWH and provided a range of gynaecology services locally. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-64537081

Nigeria's naira crisis: Supreme Court suspends banknote deadline,"Nigeria's Supreme Court has temporarily suspended Friday's deadline to stop using old banknotes, which had caused a cash crisis in the country. Many banks have not had enough of the new naira notes, leading to desperate and chaotic scenes as people tried to get their hands on them. Videos were shared of people stripping in banks in protest and fights at ATMs. The chaos led to concern that it could affect this month's elections, as many Nigerians do not have bank accounts. The head of the election commission said some of the election service providers will need to be paid in cash, and that could prove to be difficult. The Central Bank said the currency redesign would help it tackle inflation, which is currently running at about 21%. The bank said 80% of the notes currently in circulation were being held outside financial institutions. It hoped the redesign would bring some of that money being hoarded by individuals and companies back into the financial system, and so stop prices from rising so quickly.  The case, which was brought by the northern states of Kaduna, Kogi and Zamfara, has been adjourned to 15 February.

Turkey earthquake: Erdogan 'responsible for this' opposition leader says,"Anger is growing in Turkey over the government's perceived failure to prepare after thousands died in two huge earthquakes on Monday. The death toll in Turkey has risen to 6,957, according to the country's disaster agency. The figures came as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in one of the worst-affected regions. But there is growing anger politically and on the ground at his government's response and preparation. Many in the worst affected areas have challenged what they said was the slow response from the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD).  In the southern Turkish port of Iskenderun on Tuesday Arzu Dedeoglu said two of her nieces were trapped under the rubble. Her family had arranged a digger with their own resources to remove the debris, but she said officials did not allow them to use it.  ""We waited till late in the evening, but nobody came,"" Ms Dedeoglu said. ""We brought in a caterpillar (digger) with our own means, but they did not want us to use it - they stopped us. We have two kids under the rubble: my sister's daughters, Ayşegül and İlayda.  ""They are gone now, they are gone."" When emergency services eventually arrived, Ms Dedeoglu yelled that they were ""too late"". Rescue workers paused for a moment, but the girls' family begged them not to stop. ""Please don't leave - maybe my kids are still alive,"" said their mother. While many accuse the government of reacting too slowly to the quake, others say the government was not sufficiently prepared in advance. ""If there is one person responsible for this, it is Erdogan,"" said Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of Turkey's main opposition party. Mr Erdogan has announced a three-month state of emergency in 10 provinces worst-affected by an earthquake. It will end just before elections on 14 May, when the 68-year-old will attempt to stay in power after 20 years. His main opposition is an alliance of centre-left and right-wing parties, known as the Table of Six. Mr Kilicdaroglu is expected to be the presidential candidate. In a video posted on Twitter, he vowed not to meet the president ""on any platform"", accusing the government of conducting ""PR work"" since the quakes.  Anger is also mounting over an ""earthquake tax"" levied by the Turkish government in the wake of a massive quake in 1999 that killed more than 17,000 people. The estimated 88bn lira ($4.6bn; £3.8bn) was meant to have been spent on disaster prevention and the development of emergency services. Questions about the ""special communication tax"" - as the authorities call it - are asked every time there is an earthquake in Turkey. But the government has never publicly explained how the money is spent. And Mr Kilicdaroglu said Mr Erdogan's government ""has not prepared for an earthquake for 20 years"". But it's not just the president's main political rival who is voicing anger at the government's lack of preparedness.  ""Where have all our taxes gone, collected since 1999?"" Celal Deniz, 61, told the AFP news agency in the city of Gaziantep. His brother and nephews remain trapped under rubble. Social media users have also criticised some Turkish mainstream and pro-government news channels for ""muting"" criticisms by people in affected areas. Videos have been shared showing an NTV correspondent in Kahramanmaras saying locals were complaining that ""aid is inadequate"", with residents heard in the background asking: ""Where is the state?""  The channel then appears to cut the correspondent short before returning to the studio. Another video shared online showed a survivor telling a reporter on mainstream Haberturk network that ""no one has come"" to rescue them for days. The reporter subsequently moves away from the survivor and says rescuers have been ""looking everywhere"". Mr Erdogan said the state of emergency will ensure that rescue work can be ""carried out quickly"". He is scheduled to visit Kahramanmaras and Hatay, the president's office has announced. He will also go to Pazarcik, epicentre of the quake. But for many in Iskenderun, the help arrived too late. ""Why didn't you come yesterday, we were still hearing voices from the rubble yesterday!"" one woman shouted at rescue workers on Tuesday.  Another woman was in tears. ""We could have saved them if you'd arrived yesterday,"" she said. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64566296

SNP MP Stewart McDonald criticises Nicola Sturgeon's independence strategy,"An SNP MP has criticised Nicola Sturgeon's plan to use the next general election as a de facto referendum on independence.  Stewart McDonald believes the move will not actually deliver independence.  He instead urged the party to look to build sustained majority support for independence in order to force Westminster to agree to a referendum. The SNP is to hold a special conference on 19 March to decide its strategy. Members will be given two options, with the first being Ms Sturgeon's plan of attempting to win a majority of the votes in Scotland at the next general election, which is likely to be next year, and then seeking to open negotiations over independence with the UK government.  But there is no guarantee that the UK government would agree to this, and there is nothing in law that would force it to do so. Alternatively, the SNP could decide to use the next Scottish Parliament election in 2026 in the same way. There have been reports that some SNP politicians are uneasy about the proposals, which would see the SNP campaign on the single issue of independence. Mr McDonald - who is generally seen as being an ally of the first minister - has published a paper arguing that both options risked significantly damaging the independence movement.  It describes a de facto referendum as a ""deficient mechanism for the party to opt for"" which has ""the potential for all sorts of problems for the cause"" and ""will not deliver independence"".  Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme he said polling suggested that most people in Scotland were opposed to the de facto referendum plan. He warned that independence would not be delivered if only one side in the debate was treating the election as a referendum, and acknowledged the ""difficulties"" of securing more than 50% of the votes. And he argued that the SNP should ""stick to calls for a legitimate referendum"", saying that this was ""what the public would expect"" and also ""what the international community would expect"". Mr McDonald urged his party to create a ""properly funded national campaign"" aimed at driving up support for independence to levels that would force the UK government to agree to another ""legitimate"" referendum. He said: ""I think part of the reason why we are stuck at the moment and that there is this miasma of impatience - impatience that I share entirely - is because support for independence isn't yet clearly the sustained majority opinion in Scotland. ""I think that is the problem that we need to fix with some urgency before we go into the next election."" Mr McDonald said SNP branches were already starting to decide what kind of amendments and alternative positions they might put forward during the special conference.  He added: ""We can do that in the best traditions of the SNP, which is a robust exchange in a fraternal way, and get the movement onto a path that materially moves us closer to independence by taking the public with us. ""We are not quite there yet, but I believe we can do it."" Mr McDonald also insisted that Ms Sturgeon would not have to ""back away"" from her preferred strategy as she had ""correctly kicked this out to the party to have a debate and come to a decision"" on the best way forward.  Nicola Sturgeon doesn't just have opposition leaders to contend with. This week she has also been taking flak from SNP members on gender reform, as well as from her old mentor-turned-foe Alex Salmond. With a party conference looming where the first minister has invited an open debate about the route towards independence, even her allies can complicate matters. Stewart McDonald has long been seen as a pragmatic, centrist voice within the SNP's Westminster operation and the furthest thing from a rebel or thorn in the side of the leadership. But he is part of an apparently growing chorus of voices willing to kick around ideas which run contrary to Ms Sturgeon's preferred positions. To be clear, the first minister remains very much in charge of a party which remains miles ahead of its competitors in Scotland. But the rows and fractures she is currently contending with would probably have been unimaginable a year ago. Mr McDonald was speaking after revealing that his emails have been stolen and he fears they will be made public. The hack took place in January, with the group responsible believed to be linked to Russia's spy services. The same group is said to have published hacked emails and documents by other individuals, including the former head of MI6 Sir Richard Dearlove and journalist Paul Mason. The first minister's plan to use the next general election as a de facto referendum was a response to the Supreme Court ruling that she did not have the power to hold a vote on independence this year.  She later said the option of using the next Holyrood election as a de facto referendum instead of the next general election would also be put to SNP members in the interests of having a ""full and open debate"" on the way forward.  Ms Sturgeon added: ""Given the significance of this decision for both the party and the country, it is important that this debate is a full, free and open one - which is what the draft resolution seeks to enable. ""While this will be a debate on the process of securing independence, it is one that will be guided by a fundamental principle - that the future of Scotland must and will be decided by the people of Scotland, not by Westminster politicians."" The first minister had previously described talk of attempting to bring about independence via an election as a ""unionist trap"". The last time any party in Scotland got more than 50% of the votes in a general election was the Conservatives in 1955. The SNP fell just short of it while winning a huge landslide in 2015, and won 45% of the votes at the last general election in 2019.

Orange Order: Wife killer Stephen Fulton quits role,"A man convicted of shooting dead his wife has resigned from a senior position in the Orange Order, the institution has announced. Stephen Fulton, 77, had been appointed worshipful grand master of Cookstown Loyal Orange Lodge Number 3, as revealed by the Sunday Life newspaper. In April 2000 Fulton was convicted of the manslaughter of his wife Corien. She was shot in the head in their home at Old Rectory Heights in Cookstown, County Tyrone, in June 1999. Fulton was a soldier in the Royal Irish Regiment at the time. He was sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted manslaughter. On Wednesday the Orange Order said: ""The district and former district master would take this opportunity to apologise for any distress or upset caused by his installation to this post. ""Cookstown District LOL No3 now considers this matter to be closed and will not be making any further comment in relation to it. ""It is anticipated that a new district master will be elected in the coming weeks."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64568591
Quantum breakthrough could revolutionise computing," Scientists have come a step closer to making multi-tasking 'quantum' computers, far more powerful than even today's most advanced supercomputers. Quantum computers make use of the weird qualities of sub-atomic particles. So-called quantum particles can be in two places at the same time and also strangely connected even though they are millions of miles apart. A Sussex University team transferred quantum information between computer chips at record speeds and accuracy. Computer scientists have been trying to make an effective quantum computer for more than 20 years. Firms such as Google, IBM and Microsoft have developed simple machines. But, according to Prof Winfried Hensinger, who led the research at Sussex University, the new development paves the way for systems that can solve complex real world problems that the best computers we have today are incapable of. ""Right now we have quantum computers with very simple microchips,"" he said. ""What we have achieved here is the ability to realise extremely powerful quantum computers capable of solving some of the most important problems for industries and society."" Currently, computers solve problems in a simple linear way, one calculation at a time. In the quantum realm, particles can be in two places at the same time and researchers want to harness this property to develop computers that can do multiple calculations all at the same time. Quantum particles can also be millions of miles apart and be strangely connected, mirroring each other's actions instantaneously. Again, that could also be used to develop much more powerful computers.  One stumbling block has been the need to transfer quantum information between chips quickly and reliably: the information degrades, and errors are introduced. But Prof Hensinger's team has made a breakthrough, published in the journal Nature Communications, which may have overcome that obstacle. The team developed a system able to transport information from one chip to another with a reliability of 99.999993% at record speeds. That, say the researchers, shows that in principle chips could be slotted together to make a more powerful quantum computer.   Prof Michael Cuthbert, who is the director of the newly established National Quantum Computing Centre in Didcot, Oxfordshire and is independent of the Sussex research group described the development as a ""really important enabling step"". But he said that more work was needed to develop practical systems. ""To build the type of quantum computer you need in the future, you start off by connecting chips that are the size of your thumbnail until you get something the size of a dinner plate. The Sussex group has shown you can have the stability and speed for that step. ""But then you need a mechanism to connect these dinner plates together to scale up a machine, potentially as large as a football pitch, in order to carry out realistic and useful computations, and the technology for communications for that scale is not yet available."" PhD student Sahra Kulmiya, who carried out the Sussex experiment, says that the team are ready for the challenge to take the technology to the next level. ""It is not just solely a physics problem anymore,"" she told BBC News. ""It is an engineering problem, a computer science problem and also a mathematical problem. ""It is really difficult to say how close we are to the realisation of quantum computing, but I'm optimistic in how it can become relevant to us in our everyday lives."" One of the UK's leading engineering firms, Rolls Royce, is also optimistic about the technology. It is working with the Sussex researchers to develop machines that could help them design even better jet engines. Powerful supercomputers are used to model the flow of air in simulations to test out new designs of aircraft engines.  A quantum computer could in principle track the airflow with even greater accuracy, and do so really quickly, according to Prof Leigh Lapworth, who is leading the development of quantum computing for Rolls-Royce. ""Quantum computers would be able to do calculations that we can't currently do and others that would take many months or years. The potential of doing those in days would just transform our design systems and lead to even better engines."" The technology could potentially also be used to design drugs more quickly by accurately simulating their chemical reactions, a calculation too difficult for current supercomputers. They could also provide even more accurate systems to forecast weather and project the impact of climate change. Prof Hensinger said he first had the idea of developing a quantum computer more than 20 years ago.  ""People rolled their eyes and said: 'it's impossible'."" ""And when people tell me something can't be done, I just love to try. So I have spent the past 20 years removing the barriers one by one to a point where one can now really build a practical quantum computer.""

Chile forest fires: Heatwave puts news regions at risk,"The Chilean government has put three central regions of the country on high alert of forest fires amid a heatwave. while thousands of firefighters continue to battle blazes in the south.  Twenty-four people are confirmed to have died in the fires which have been raging for more than a week.  Thousands have been left homeless after their houses went up in flames.  Now it is feared that high temperatures forecast for the rest of the week could ignite fires in new regions. The deputy ministry of the interior, Manuel Monsalve, said that all teams had been put on standby to fight any possible blazes as temperatures could exceed 37 degrees Celsius.  Almost 300,000 hectares have already gone up in flames in the regions of Ñuble, Maule, Biobío and Auracanía. On Tuesday, smoke from the fires drifted over the capital, Santiago.  More than 5,000 firefighters are in action to try to put out the more than 300 fires. The United States has sent a DC-10 Air Tanker plane capable of carrying 36,000 litres of water.  Argentina, Mexico, and Spain have also sent specially trained emergency workers to help extinguish the flames.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-64568379
Turkey's Erdogan fighting to stay in power after 20 years,"From humble beginnings, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has grown into a political giant, leading Turkey for 20 years and reshaping his country more than any leader since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the revered father of the modern republic. Now he faces one of the biggest tests of his political career, as Turkey reels from its most devastating earthquake since 1999.  He survived a coup attempt in 2016, but his chances of extending his rule into a third decade may now hinge on his handling of the quake that has hit 10 provinces in the south-east. Rampant inflation and a cost-of-living crisis has already hit his poll ratings and, as May elections approach, an emboldened opposition has accused him of failing to prepare for Monday's disaster in a country prone to powerful earthquakes. For a pugnacious leader who built a proud record on modernising and developing Turkey, the loss of so many lives in the rubble of thousands of buildings represents a real threat. Opposition leaders were quick to visit the region well before the president arrived. First as prime minister from 2003 and then as directly elected president since 2014, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has flexed Turkey's muscles as a regional power, championed Islamist causes and been quick to outmanoeuvre domestic opposition. Although he is the head of a Nato country, he has positioned himself as a broker in Russia's war in Ukraine and kept Sweden and Finland waiting in their bids to join the Western defensive alliance. His muscular diplomacy has riled allies in Europe and beyond. While many Turks are looking for a future without him, President Erdogan is a proven election winner and will not give up power lightly. He has already sought to prevent a leading rival, the mayor of Istanbul, from running. He, more than anyone, knew the risk of defeat at the hands of a popular Istanbul mayor, because that was the role in which he built his powerbase in the 1990s. Born in February 1954, Recep Tayyip Erdogan grew up the son of a coastguard, on Turkey's Black Sea coast. When he was 13, his father decided to move to Istanbul, hoping to give his five children a better upbringing.  The young Erdogan sold lemonade and sesame buns to earn extra cash. He attended an Islamic school before obtaining a degree in management from Istanbul's Marmara University - and playing professional football.   In the 1970s and 80s, he was active in Islamist circles, joining Necmettin Erbakan's pro-Islamic Welfare Party. As the party grew in popularity in the 1990s, Mr Erdogan was elected as its candidate for mayor of Istanbul in 1994 and ran the city for the next four years. But his term came to an end when he was convicted of inciting racial hatred for publicly reading a nationalist poem that included the lines: ""The mosques are our barracks, the domes our helmets, the minarets our bayonets and the faithful our soldiers."" After serving four months in jail, he returned to politics. But his party had been banned for violating the strict secular principles of the modern Turkish state. In August 2001, he founded an new, Islamist-rooted party with ally Abdullah Gul. In 2002, the AKP won a majority in parliamentary elections and the following year, Mr Erdogan was appointed prime minister. He remains chairman of the AKP or Justice and Development Party to this day. From 2003, he spent three terms as prime minister, presiding over a period of steady economic growth and winning praise internationally as a reformer. The country's middle class expanded and millions were taken out of poverty, as Mr Erdogan prioritised giant infrastructure projects to modernise Turkey. But critics warned he was becoming increasingly autocratic. By 2013, protesters took to the streets, partly because of his government's plans to transform a much-loved park in the centre of Istanbul, but also in a challenge to more authoritarian rule. The prime minister condemned the protesters as ""capulcu"" (riff-raff), and neighbourhoods would clang pots and pans at nine o'clock every night in a spirit of defiance. Allegations of corruption ensnared the sons of three cabinet allies. The Gezi Park protests marked a turning point in his rule. To his detractors, he was acting more like a sultan from the Ottoman Empire than a democrat. Mr Erdogan also fell out with a US-based Islamic scholar called Fethullah Gulen, whose social and cultural movement had helped him to victory in three consecutive elections and had been active in removing the military from politics. It was a feud that would have dramatic repercussions for Turkish society. After a decade of his rule, Mr Erdogan's party also moved to lift a ban on women wearing headscarves in public services that was introduced after a military coup in 1980. The ban was eventually lifted for women in the police, military and judiciary. Critics complained he had chipped away at the pillars of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's secular republic. While religious himself, Mr Erdogan always denied wanting to impose Islamic values, insisting he supported the rights of Turks to express their religion more openly. However, he has repeatedly supported criminalising adultery. And as a father of four, he has said ""no Muslim family"" should consider birth control or family planning. ""We will multiply our descendants,"" he said in May 2016. He has extolled motherhood, condemned feminists and said men and women cannot be treated equally. Mr Erdogan has long championed Islamist causes - groups ideologically close to Egypt's repressed Muslim Brotherhood. He has been known to give the latter's four-finger salute - the rabaa. In July 2020, he oversaw the conversion of Istanbul's historic Hagia Sophia into a mosque, angering many Christians. It was built 1,500 years ago as a cathedral, and made into a mosque by the Ottoman Turks, but Ataturk had turned it into a museum - a symbol of the new secular state. Barred from running again for prime minister, in 2014 he stood for the largely ceremonial role of president in unprecedented direct elections. He had big plans for reforming the post, creating a new constitution that would benefit all Turks and place their country among the world's top 10 economies. But early in his presidency, he faced two jolts to his power. His party lost its majority in parliament for several months in a 2015 vote, and then months later, in 2016, Turkey witnessed its first violent attempted coup for decades. Rebel soldiers came close to capturing the president, holidaying at a coastal resort, but he was airlifted to safety. In the early hours of 16 July, he emerged triumphant at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport, to the cheers of supporters. Almost 300 civilians were killed as they blocked the advance of the coup plotters. The president appeared on national TV and rallied supporters in Istanbul, declaring he was the ""chief commander"". But the strain was clear when he sobbed openly while giving a speech at the funeral of a close friend, shot with his son by mutinous soldiers. The plot was blamed on the Gulen movement and led to some 150,000 public servants being sacked and more than 50,000 people being detained, including soldiers, journalists, lawyers, police officers, academics and Kurdish politicians. This crackdown on critics caused alarm abroad, contributing to frosty relations with the EU: Turkey's bid to join the union has not progressed for years. Arguments over an influx of migrants into Greece exacerbated the ill-feeling. But from his gleaming, 1,000-room Ak Saray palace overlooking Ankara, President Erdogan's position appeared more secure than ever. He narrowly won a 2017 referendum granting him sweeping presidential powers, including the right to impose a state of emergency and appoint top public officials as well as intervene in the legal system. A year later, he secured outright victory in the first round of a presidential poll. His core vote lies in small Anatolian towns and rural, conservative areas. In 2019, his party lost in the three biggest cities - Istanbul; the capital, Ankara; and Izmir. Losing the Istanbul mayorship narrowly to Ekrem Imamoglu of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) was a bitter blow to Mr Erdogan, who was the city's mayor in the 1990s. He never accepted the result. Mr Imamoglu was ahead of the president in the opinion polls before he was banned from running in the May elections. The president and his allies have been accused of using the courts to disqualify the popular mayor from the vote. Turkey's third biggest party, the pro-Kurdish HDP, is also facing the threat of a ban from the parliamentary vote because of alleged links to Kurdish militants. Like previous Turkish leaders, President Erdogan has cracked down hard on the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).  Although Turkey has taken in more than three million refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war, Ankara has also launched operations against Kurdish militias across the borders, alienating Kurds in Turkey. And it is Kurds in Sweden whom Mr Erdogan is blaming for a hold-up in Stockholm's bid to join Nato. Both Sweden and Finland have sought to join the alliance in response to Russia's war in Ukraine, but the Turkish leader says dozens of Kurds should be extradited before he will agree. Mr Erdogan has long held close ties with Russia's Vladimir Putin and has sought a pivotal role as a mediator in the conflict in Ukraine. He helped to broker a deal opening a safe corridor for grain exports through the Black Sea, and prevented its collapse when Russia moved to end its support for the agreement.

Mary Queen of Scots: Secret letters written during imprisonment decoded,"Secret letters written in code by Mary, Queen of Scots during her imprisonment in England have been uncovered and decoded by a team of cryptographers.  The documents, which were believed to have been lost, were found in the National Library of France in Paris.  They were written to her supporters while she was imprisoned by Queen Elizabeth I in the 16th Century. Experts said the codebreakers' work on the 57 letters was the most significant discovery about Mary for 100 years. They had been wrongly catalogued in the library, and only when the code was broken was it possible to identify Mary as the author.  Working through a complex pattern of symbols in the letters, they revealed Mary's complaints about the conditions of her detention, her feelings of abandonment by France and attempts to broker her release.  The letters date from 1578 to 1584, a few years before Mary's beheading 436 years ago - on 8 February, 1587. Dr George Lasry, who led the study, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme it was a ""fairly complex"" process that took about two months, with more than one option for every letter of the alphabet. ""We were expecting Italian because that is what the catalogue said, but then we started to see some French words - 'ma liberté' (my freedom) - and sentences no-one would write if they were free,"" he explained. ""So we knew it was someone in captivity, and some of the language was in feminine form, so it was a woman. She also wrote 'mon fils' - my son - so it was woman in captivity with a son.  ""We thought 'this is too crazy', it can't be Mary Stuart. But then we saw the word 'Walsingham' and we knew Francis Walsingham was the spymaster of Queen Elizabeth I, so we concluded it was from Mary.  ""It was very difficult to believe at the start so it was a very exciting moment."" The romantic, doomed figure of Mary Stuart lived out the last 19 years of her life in English captivity.  Despite close surveillance, she was able to pass out the secret letters to her supporters via some trusted courtiers who visited her.  Most are addressed to Michel de Castelnau de Mauvissiere, the French ambassador to England, who was a supporter of Mary, a Catholic. The existence of a confidential communication channel between Mary and Castelnau was well-known to historians, and even to the English government at the time. The documents ended up in Paris because their destination was the French ambassador in London.  The existence of the letters was suspected, but they were thought to have been lost.  An international team of code-breakers, which combs online archives for historic encrypted documents, stumbled across them in France's national library. Dr Lasry, a computer scientist and cryptographer, working alongside Norbert Biermann, a pianist and music professor, and Satoshi Tomokiyo, a physicist and patents expert, uncovered 57 with the same cipher. The letters also reveal Mary's animosity towards Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester and a favourite of Queen Elizabeth I. She also expressed her distress when her son James - the future King James I of England - was abducted in August 1582. ""There is a lot of detail in there about intrigue, politics, her attempts to bribe officials and complaints about her health and conditions in captivity,"" Dr Lasry added. ""We are just starting to scratch the surface of the content."" Dr John Guy, a history fellow at the University of Cambridge who wrote the 2004 biography of Mary Queen of Scots, said the discovery was ""a literary and historical sensation"".  ""This is the most important new find on Mary Queen of Scots for 100 years,"" he added. ""These new documents, amounting to some 50,000 words, show Mary to have been a shrewd and attentive analyst of international affairs.  ""They will occupy historians of Britain and Europe and students of the French language and early modern ciphering techniques for many years to come."" The authors suggest that other coded letters written by Mary may still be missing. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-64568222
EU funds: Community workers at risk of redundancy.,"Community organisations in Northern Ireland have put 400 workers on notice of redundancy due to a lack of funding. One-thousand workers in total are predicted to lose their jobs, according to the Community Sector Peer Group. The peer group represents 22 organisations across Northern Ireland that provide services to vulnerable people. The European Social Fund (ESF) had previously provided about £40m a year. It is to end at the end of March. Rev Andrew Irvine, the chair of the Community Sector Peer Group, said it was facing at a 60% funding cut due to funding not being replaced. ""That will be disastrous for the 18,000 vulnerable people we help every year and our 1,700 staff who deliver that support,"" he said. ""At a time when public finances are at breaking point it's incredibly short-sighted to be even contemplating cutting, let alone slashing, employability services."" The ESF funding ended as a result of Brexit and the UK government has yet to replace it. The government has previously said that funding will ""ramp up"" over time so that total domestic UK-wide funding will at least match receipts from EU structural funds.

Putin 'supplied' MH17 missile - investigators,"There are strong indications that Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to supply the missile that downed flight MH17 in 2014, international investigators say.  The aircraft was hit by a Russian-made missile over Ukraine, killing nearly 300 people. Prosecutors said there is evidence that Mr Putin decided to provide the missile to Moscow-backed separatists. There is no suggestion that Mr Putin ordered the aircraft be shot down. In November, a Dutch court found three men - two Russians and a Ukrainian - guilty of murder in absentia for their part in the downing of MH17. The prosecutors said on Wednesday that they had exhausted all leads and could not continue with any more criminal proceedings. The Boeing 777 was flying from the Dutch capital to Kuala Lumpur when it was hit by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile in July 2014 during a conflict between pro-Russia rebels and Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region of Ukraine. Of the 298 passengers and crew, 196 were Dutch while many of the other passengers came from Malaysia, Australia, the UK, Belgium and other countries. In a statement, the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) said the court ruled that Moscow had ""overall control"" over the Donetsk People's Republic, which controlled the area in July 2014.  It cited recorded telephone conversations where Russian officials said that the decision to provide military support ""rests with the President"". ""There is concrete information that the separatists' request was presented to the president, and that this request was granted,"" it said.  But it adds that is not known whether the request ""explicitly mentions"" the system used to shoot down MH17. ""Although we speak of strong indications, the high bar of complete and conclusive evidence is not reached,"" investigators said. ""Furthermore, the President enjoys immunity in his position as Head of State."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64566297
UK regulator opposes Microsoft deal to buy Activision,"The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has said it is opposed to Microsoft's planned purchase of games developer Activision Blizzard. The CMA said it had provisionally concluded it would result in higher prices, fewer choices and less innovation. The $69bn (£57bn) deal would see Xbox-maker Microsoft acquire hit titles such as Call of Duty and Candy Crush. Microsoft said it would find solutions to ""address the CMA's concerns"".  Rima Alaily, Microsoft corporate vice-president and deputy general counsel, said: ""Our commitment to grant long-term 100% equal access to Call of Duty to Sony, Nintendo, Steam and others preserves the deal's benefits to gamers and developers, and increases competition in the market.""

Translink to raise fares by 7% on all services,"Translink fares are to increase by approximately 7% from 6 March, the Department for Infrastructure (DfI) has said. The rise will affect public travel on Metro, Glider, NI Railways, Enterprise, Goldliner and Ulsterbus services. Prices have remained frozen for about four years as a response to the cost of living crisis. Translink said the fare review had been requested by DfI because of pressures on their budget allocations. A spokesperson for the department said: ""The secretary of state for Northern Ireland stated that steps would need to be taken to improve Translink's sustainability through the uprating of public transport fares. ""The department fully recognises the challenges facing many people in the current cost of living crisis.  ""However, significant budget pressures mean the below inflation uplift is needed to maintain and improve public transport services."" Northern Ireland Office Minister Steve Baker has already warned Stormont's budget will be ""very difficult"" next year as legislation allowing the UK government to pass a budget for NI is being fast-tracked at Westminster. The budget sets out spending allocated to Stormont's nine departments for this financial year. They have been operating without proper budgets since the start of the financial year in April due to the collapse of the executive. Translink's Group chief executive Chris Conway said: ""We understand this will add to the cost of living pressures our passengers are already facing, however we have worked very hard to keep fare adjustments low and, indeed, having had no fare increase in four years, in real terms our fares still offer good value.    ""We know any increase is unwelcome, but we are confident that bus and train travel is still an attractive and competitive option, compared to private motoring particularly given the cost of fuel.   ""It is also the heathier, smarter and cleaner travel choice for a better-connected society.""

Swansea's Palace Theatre no longer at risk after repairs,"A historic venue which fell into ""dangerous"" disrepair is no longer considered to be at risk following restoration work. The Grade-II listed Palace Theatre in Swansea has been empty since it closed as a nightclub in 2006.  The 135-year-old building was on the Theatres Trust risk register due to its ""deteriorating"" condition. But in 2016, Swansea council part-funded urgent repairs, before buying it in 2020 to turn into office space. The local authority said the former Victorian music hall will also have space to accommodate ""small scale"" performances when works are completed. The Theatres Trust - an advisory body which safeguards theatres across the UK - said while its ""preferred outcome"" would be for the building to be used for live performances, ""it has been evident that there is not the demand in the city to make another theatre viable"". ""This is a much better outcome than allowing the building to sit empty and risk severe deterioration and potential structural decay,"" it said. The Palace Theatre was once the place to be seen in the city, attracting up to 900 theatre-goers a night during its heyday at the turn of the 20th Century. Built in 1888, over the years it has hosted performances from the likes of Sir Anthony Hopkins and Charlie Chaplin. Swansea council leader Rob Stewart said he was ""delighted"" that work on the ""beautiful"" theatre building meant it was no longer at risk. ""Having recently taken it out of private ownership, the council is saving this unique and historic structure for future generations,"" he said. ""Work is progressing well and we look forward to opening the building as a home to business next year, bringing new life to the High Street area and new opportunities to the city."" The project is being funded by the European Regional Development Fund, the Welsh government and Swansea council. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64568449

Notorious Russian nationalist Igor Mangushev shot dead in Ukraine,"Notorious Russian army captain and mercenary Igor Mangushev has died in hospital, days after he was shot in the head at close range in occupied Ukraine, his friends have said. Mangushev's wife Tatyana described his killing as an execution. He commanded an anti-drone unit in occupied Luhansk, but had also been one of the founders of a mercenary group fighting Ukrainian forces in 2014.  He took to a stage last summer holding a man's skull. In a video posted on social media in August, Mangushev was filmed saying the skull belonged to a Ukrainian fighter killed defending the Azovstal steel works in the southern port of Mariupol. An extreme nationalist, Mangushev said Russia was not at war with people, but with an idea of Ukraine as an ""anti-Russian state"", and it did not matter how many Ukrainians died.  Mangushev emerged from a neo-Nazi movement to co-found private mercenary group Yenot (raccoon).  He was later known to have collaborated with Russia's most notorious mercenary boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, as a political strategist.  The shooting has prompted widespread speculation about who might have carried out the attack at a checkpoint in the occupied Ukrainian town of Kadiivka, some distance from the frontline. Russian reports said he had been shot at close range with a 9mm bullet fired from the top of his head at an angle of 45 degrees. Russian authorities are investigating the killing and have so far said nothing about the circumstances. The bullet had reportedly lodged in his brain. Before he died, pictures showed him lying in a hospital bed. Another extreme Russian nationalist, Pavel Gubarev, said everyone knew who was behind the shooting and observed that Prigozhin had for the moment gone quiet. The 11-month war in Ukraine has energised the murky world of extremists in Russia and sparked rivalries between them. After the attack, Russia expert Mark Galeotti said it demonstrated that Russia was sliding back towards aspects of the 1990s, ""when murder was a business tactic, and the lines between politics, business, crime and war became near-meaningless"".

"Davy Morgan: TT rider died after losing control, inquest told","An experienced motorcycle rider from Northern Ireland died after losing control of his bike during an Isle of Man TT race, an inquest has heard. Davy Morgan, 52, crashed at a corner near the 27th Milestone on 6 June during the third and final lap of the 2022 Supersport event. Coroner James Brooks recorded a verdict of death by misadventure at Douglas Courthouse. He offered his condolences to the rider's family for the ""shocking loss"". While the risk and skill involved in racing at the TT was ""part of the thrill"", it only took ""a brief moment for the risk to become real"", Mr Brooks said. Mr Morgan had completed the first two laps of the afternoon race without difficulty, the inquest heard.  Racing on a yellow Yamaha machine, the rider from County Down lost control at the bend just after Guthrie's Memorial on the Mountain Road section of the TT course and collided with padded barriers. The inquest heard race conditions were good, and inspections of the bike before and after the crash found no issues that had contributed to it.  A marshal who witnessed the incident said Mr Morgan, who she recognised due to his distinctive pink helmet, was an ""extremely experienced"" rider and there had been nothing unusual about his approach to the bend.  Mr Brooks said although the Northern Ireland racer's style was to lean into corners, the way he had taken the bend was ""safe and proper"". However, his front wheel had slipped away causing him to lose control of the bike, he added. Since his debut in 2002 Mr Morgan had competed at every Isle of Man TT and had previously won the Senior Manx Grand Prix race in 2004. Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and Twitter?

Turkey-Syria earthquake: Fire at Turkey port adds to quake disruption,"A huge fire at one of Turkey's main ports has been extinguished, the defence ministry has said. The blaze at Iskenderun, on Turkey's Mediterranean coast, was caused by Monday's earthquakes that have devastated parts of the country. Hundreds of shipping containers had caught fire, sending an enormous plume of dense, black smoke into the sky. Despite claims the fire had been put out, a BBC reporter saw it still smouldering on Wednesday morning. The defence ministry said military helicopters and planes were used to help bring the fire under control when fighting the flames from the land and sea did not work. All operations were shut down at the port, and major shipping firms were forced to divert their vessels to other terminals in the region. When they will be able to return to Iskenderun is unknown. Despite the size of the fire, the flames did not spread to a section where flammable materials were stored, a source from the port told Reuters news agency.

Somalia drought: One boy's fight to save his family from starvation,"Dahir's brother died of hunger. Now two of his sisters are fighting sickness and malnutrition. The BBC's Andrew Harding returns to Baidoa to revisit a family forced to flee Somalia's worst drought in 40 years, as authorities urge the international community to recognise the crisis as a famine. Warning: This article contains images some readers may find distressing Eleven-year-old Dahir weaves his way between a growing cluster of homemade huts on the edge of Baidoa, heading to a tin-roofed school building near the main road. He is wearing his only shirt and trousers, and clutching his one other possession - a new schoolbook. The school's sole teacher, Abdullah Ahmed, 29, writes English days of the week on the blackboard, as Dahir, and perhaps 50 classmates, recite: ""Saturday, Sunday, Monday..."". For a few minutes, a burst of interest energises the children, but soon the yawns and coughs resume - signs of the hunger and sickness that echo, like a grim soundtrack, across the plateau of rocky ground around Baidoa that has become home in recent months for hundreds of thousands of civilians, displaced by the worst drought to hit Somalia for 40 years. ""I think at least 30 of these children have not had breakfast. Sometimes they come to me to tell me of their hunger,"" says Mr Ahmed. ""They struggle to concentrate, or even to come to class.""  Six weeks ago, on our last visit to this part of southern Somalia, Dahir sat, weeping, beside his mother Fatuma, outside the family's flimsy home-made hut.  A few days earlier, his younger brother, Salat, had starved to death on the journey into Baidoa from the drought-parched countryside.  Salat was buried a few metres away. Now the grave is surrounded by huts built by newer arrivals. ""I'm worried about my sisters. I wash for them. I wash their faces too,"" says Dahir, glancing across at six-year-old Mariam, who coughed hoarsely and complained of a headache, and then at four-year-old Malyun, sitting lethargically and with sunken eyes on her mother's knee.  ""She is warm. I think she has measles. They may both have measles,"" says Fatuma, putting her hand to Malyun's forehead.  Measles and pneumonia have swept through Baidoa in recent months, killing many younger children whose immune systems have been weakened by malnutrition. At the provincial hospital in the centre of Baidoa, doctors and nurses move between beds in the intensive care ward, inserting fluid drips into emaciated infants' arms, and oxygen tubes into tiny nostrils.  Several children's limbs are dark and blistered - as if from severe burns - one painful reaction to prolonged starvation.  ""We have received some more [aid] supplies. But still not enough,"" says Abdullahi Yusuf, the hospital's head doctor.   ""The world is paying attention to Somalia's drought now. We see visitors from international donors. But that doesn't mean we are getting enough support. I hope it will come soon. It is a desperate situation.""  Six weeks ago, he described the situation as ""terrifying."" Today he acknowledges a slight drop in admission numbers but explains that was probably due to a few days of rain which had disrupted some dirt roads and prompted some families to focus on trying to plant crops rather than bringing sick children to hospital. Back at the camp, Fatuma lugs a plastic jerrycan of water home from a communal tap. Dahir emerges from the hut to help her clean a battered metal bowl while her ailing daughters lie, wearily inside the hut.  ""My boy is a big help. He does so much to help the girls,"" says Fatuma. While she boils water, her phone rings. Her husband, 60-year-old Adan Nur, is calling from their home in a village three days' walk away, in territory controlled by Islamist militant group al-Shabab. ""He says he's planted sorghum. He's okay. He will return soon. But we have lost all our livestock. There is no way we can make a living from just the crops, so I will stay here. That way of life is over,"" says Fatuma after the call is over. Her decision is backed up by the views of many experts, who warn that this rainy season appears to be failing, just like the last four - spreading a blush of green across the wilderness outside Baidoa but making no real impact on the crisis. ""It's still getting worse. A lot of people are still coming here to seek food, safety, and water. And many children are dying of malnutrition. We urge [the government and international community] to consider the situation… as a famine,"" says Baidoa's Mayor Abdullah Watiin, stepping briefly out of a community meeting in a heavily guarded compound.  Inside the hall, an army general warns local people about the growing threat from al-Shabab, telling them to be on the look-out for explosive devices and ambushes.  Somali government troops and militias are expected to widen an offensive that appears to have been met with some success further north, but that risks making it even harder to access some rural communities hit hardest by the drought. Later in the day, Fatuma settles her two sickest children - Mariam and four-year-old Malyun - on a blanket on the dirt floor of their hut.  An offer to take the children to hospital was rejected in favour of a course of traditional herbal remedies. Then Fatuma, weary too, lies down beside the girls. ""I just want them to get better,"" says Dahir, watching from his own small blanket, then solemnly repeating the phrase two more times. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-63597221

Turkey earthquake: Anger at building standards grows,"Anger is growing in Turkey that poor enforcement of regulations contributed to the collapse of many buildings in the recent earthquakes. The BBC has verified examples of recently built blocks that collapsed in the latest disaster. One building in Malatya (seen below) was finished last year and advertised as being ""completed in compliance with the latest earthquake regulations.""  The advert stated that all materials and workmanship used were ""first-class quality"". This was deleted after the building collapsed, but not before people had taken pictures and videos of the advert and posted them online. The advertisement matches the style of similar ones on the company website. Another recently built apartment block in the port city of Iskenderun has been pictured largely destroyed. The construction company for this building posted an image showing it was completed in 2019. The BBC has verified that the image of the destroyed building (right) matches the location of company's publicity shot of the block (left). Although the quakes were powerful, experts say properly constructed buildings should have been able to stay standing. ""The maximum intensity for this earthquake was violent but not necessarily enough to bring well constructed buildings down,"" says David Alexander, Professor of Emergency Planning and Management at University College London. ""In most places the level of shaking was less than the maximum, so we can conclude out of the thousands of buildings that collapsed, almost all of them don't stand up to any reasonably expected earthquake construction code.""  Construction regulations have been tightened following previous disasters, most recently in 2018.  Stricter safety standards were also brought in following the 1999 earthquake around the city of Izmit, in the north-west of the country, in which 17,000 people died.  The latest rules require structures in earthquake-prone regions to use high quality concrete reinforced with steel bars. Columns and beams must also be distributed to effectively absorb the impact of earthquakes.  These laws, however, have been poorly enforced. ""In part the problem is that there's very little retrofitting of existing buildings, but there's also very little enforcement of building standards on new builds,"" says David Alexander, Professor of Emergency Planning and Management at University College London. The government has provided periodic ""construction amnesties"", effectively legal exemptions for the payment of a fee, for those structures built without the required safety certificates. These have been passed since the 1960s (the latest in 2018). Critics have long warned that such amnesties risk catastrophe in the event of a major earthquake. Up to 75,000 buildings across the affected earthquake zone in southern Turkey have been given construction amnesties, according to Pelin Pınar Giritlioğlu, Istanbul head of the Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects' Chamber of City Planners. Just a few days before the latest disaster, Turkish media reported that a new draft law is waiting parliamentary approval which would grant  a further amnesty for recent construction work. Geologist Celal Sengor says that passing such construction amnesties in a country riven by fault lines amounts to a ""crime"".  After a deadly earthquake hit the western province of Izmir in 2020, a BBC Turkish report found that 672,000 buildings in Izmir had benefited from the most recent amnesty. This same report cited the Environment and Urbanisation Ministry as stating in 2018 that over 50% of buildings in Turkey - equivalent to almost 13 million buildings - were constructed in violation of regulations.  We've contacted the Environment and Urbanisation Ministry for comment about building standards in Turkey following the most recent earthquakes, who said: ""No building constructed by our administration has collapsed. Damage assessment studies are continuing rapidly in the field."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/64568826

Police later said a driver was arrested in connection with the incident. In a statement, released by the force, the student's family said: ""Chinenye was a wonderful, kind, intelligent young woman with a strong faith in God. She had a passion to succeed and whatever obstacles she faced were overcome.  ""She was very family-oriented and always had time for everyone. Our lives will never be the same without her."" Ms Okonkwo had been a student in Glasgow since January last year. GCU principal and vice-chancellor Prof Steve Decent said: ""It is with great sadness that we heard of the passing of Chinenye Okonkwo in a tragic road traffic accident.   ""We offer our sincere condolences to Chinenye's family and friends and our thoughts are with them at this very difficult time. ""This is a terrible shock for our community, especially those who knew Chinenye."" Prof Decent added the university's student wellbeing team was available to provide support to those who needed it. Last week officers said one of the two drivers involved in the incident, a 28-year-old woman, was arrested but released pending further investigation.

Turkey earthquake: 'My parents fled as home collapsed around them',"A woman whose parents managed to escape as the walls of their home collapsed in front of them when an earthquake struck said the situation was heart-breaking.  More than 11,000 people have been killed and thousands injured when the earthquake struck south-eastern Turkey, near the Syrian border, on Monday. Seyma Yapar, from Sale, Greater Manchester, said her parents' home in Belen had been destroyed. She said they had asked her to pray for them and send help. ""The only thing they say is 'we're OK, don't worry about us, stay strong, you can't come here because there is no place to stay, you can't do anything, just pray for us or try to send some help',"" she said. ""They don't talk much about their feelings or emotions.  ""They don't even want to talk about the house which is gone.  ""So I'm sure they're traumatised, but they don't want to talk about it."" The earthquake, which hit near the town of Gaziantep, was closely followed by numerous aftershocks including one quake which was almost as large as the first. The death toll is expected to rise further in the coming days.  Ms Yapar, whose childhood friend, aged 34, died in the quake, said her parents Firdevs and Yahya had lived in their neighbour's car for a day before travelling to the closest city to find shelter. ""I've been feeling guilty,"" she told BBC North West Tonight. ""How come I can eat my food in my comfy house in my warm house and they're out there,"" she said. ""So I don't have the right to eat. I feel so guilty about it.  ""Even like sleeping. I shouldn't sleep. I don't have the right to sleep. ""Watching the news or reading things on social media breaks my heart."" Volkan Esengul, general manager at Venus Foods Ltd in Manchester, has also faced an anxious wait for answers along with many of his colleagues. The majority of workers at the family-run wholesalers have family in Turkey.  ""If you ask anyone they've lost a dad or a cousin or a relative. No-one's not affected,"" he said. ""If you've not heard by now you're not in a good situation. ""The very best you can hope for is 'my family's alive but their house has gone'. And that's good news for most people."" Mr Esengul said his grandmother, who lives in Turkey, was in the UK when the earthquake struck.   ""[Her home] is rubble and it's finished,"" he said.  ""She was visiting family in London and if she hadn't been - I don't want to think about it."" Mr Esengul is among the many desperate to help with the company arranging a truck to deliver food, water and toiletries to Turkey.   North West Turkish Community Association is also among the organisations who have set up collections to help the relief effort with a drop-off point set up in Trafford Park. Within hours, essential items such as blankets and clothing had been donated by those wanting to help including Naime Ozdemir. ""We are trying our best to help our country,"" she said. ""It's horrifying. It's so sad."" Serkan Senol, from the association, urged the public to help support those in desperate need, adding ""this could happen to anyone in the world"".  Frontline medical aid charity UK-Med, which is based in Stockport, has already sent a five-strong team of medics to help. They are currently organising medical supplies to send out including equipment to set up a field hospital.  Gemma Blakey, acting head of logistics at UK-Med, said it was ""straight into action stations"" as soon as they heard about the earthquake.  ""This is what we trained and prepare for,"" she said. Aid charity Human Appeal, which is based in Manchester but has offices in Turkey, is also helping with the relief efforts. Zaheer Khan, from the charity, said it was not just about saving people from the rubble but it was about helping those who have lost everything.

Gabby Petito appears bruised and bloodied in new photo,"A photo of killed blogger Gabby Petito has been released by her family's lawyers, revealing cuts, bruises and smeared blood on her face.  Lawyers say it was taken moments before police stopped her and her fiancé, Brian Laundrie, in Utah in August 2021 on a domestic disturbance call.  Ms Petito was found dead weeks later in a Wyoming campground. Mr Laundrie later shot himself.  Her family is suing Utah police over negligence. The photo was released on Monday by her family's lawyers and was previously described in a lawsuit the family filed against the Moab City Police Department in November. The family have accused the police of negligence in its hiring and training practices. They also allege negligence against the officers who handled the domestic violence report. The city of Moab issued a statement denying responsibility for Ms Petito's murder and said it would contest the lawsuit.Ms Petito, 22, and Mr Laundrie, 23, had been on a cross-country excursion in a van during the summer of 2021. Ms Petito posted several images of her picturesque road trip on social media. But at some point, things turned terribly wrong. Ms Petito's family reported her missing in September, not too long after her distressed selfie was taken.  A witness who saw the couple at a grocery store in Moab, Utah, on 12 August 2021, called police and reported that Mr Laundrie had hit Ms Petito and attempted to take her mobile phone and leave her stranded outside the store. Moab City Police Department officers later encountered the couple and interviewed them for almost an hour. Bodycam footage showed Ms Petito crying and complaining about her mental health to officers. She also said the couple had been arguing more frequently. A police report of the incident said Mr Laundrie claimed Ms Petito hit him after an argument. The officers recommended they spend the night apart, but did not file any charges.  Ms Petito allegedly revealed her injuries to Moab police, who the family's lawyers say ignored her ""and did nothing more to investigate or document the injury"".  Ms Petito's body was found on 19 September at a campground near Grand Teton National Park in north-western Wyoming. The coroner ruled her death a homicide. On 20 October, Mr Laundrie's body was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head in a Florida nature preserve near his parents' home. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64543013
Turkey earthquake: Yorkshire communities rally round for victims,"Members of the Syrian and Turkish communities in Yorkshire have spoken of their horror as family and friends were caught up in the deadly earthquakes. One man whose relatives were forced to flee their home in Turkey said they described it as ""like Doomsday"". Many have lost contact with loved ones as communication systems were damaged. Local groups have launched aid missions, raising money and gathering clothes and other supplies to send to those affected. Yasin Mikyas, who runs a cafe in Shipley, West Yorkshire, said his customers had been donating money to help. He said his home city of Batman, in the south east of Turkey, was badly hit. ""The people there are suffering a lot, especially my family,"" he said. ""They have to stay outside with the kids and they don't get really much help and it's really cold. They've got nowhere to go."" As well as coping with thick snow, the city is still being rocked by aftershocks. ""It's still going on, they're still not safe. It's just shock after shock,"" he added. The death toll in Turkey and Syria stands at more than 11,000 and is expected to rise further in the days ahead. York barber Ali Kala said it was difficult to keep in contact with some of his family. He said they lived close to the epicentre of the first quake near the Turkish city of Gaziantep and their house was completely destroyed. ""Everywhere is closed,"" he said. ""Can't contact anybody, no electric, no gas, they lost everything."" Seismologists said the 7.8 magnitude tremor struck at 04:17 local time on Monday in the south east of the country close to the Syrian border. The first quake was one of the largest ever recorded in Turkey. Survivors said it took two minutes for the shaking to stop. About 12 hours later, a second powerful tremor hit further north with a magnitude of 7.5, and its epicentre was in the Elbistan district of Kahramanmaras province. In Hull, the Turkish community has rallied round to support the people caught up in the devastation. Emine Kaya from the Hull Turkish Education Society said that, within hours of the news breaking, people had arrived at the centre with donations of supplies, including clothing and blankets. ""So many ladies came up last night, they helped to put it in the boxes, put them out, write notes,"" she said. ""We Turkish people do care about each other a lot."" Ms Kaya said she had experienced a previous earthquake which badly damaged buildings in her home town. ""I know how it feels, I know what they're feeling now,"" she said. ""It's cold, the snow. You're lost, you don't know what to do."" Dr Ahmed Khaleel, chair of the York City of Sanctuary charity, said his family in Turkey had a lucky escape when the earthquake hit early on Monday morning. ""They were all awake when it happened, so they managed to leave the house very quickly and take the car and go outside,"" he said. ""Then buildings started to collapse."" He said that his relatives were now housed in tents in woods outside the city. ""They describe it as like Doomsday,"" he said. ""In a matter of minutes, just seconds, everything happened. Life turned into death and safety turned into horror."" Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Send your story ideas to yorkslincs.news@bbc.co.uk.

Romney to Santos: 'You don't belong here',"Republican Senator Mitt Romney told Rep George Santos that he had no place in Congress in a heated exchange ahead of Tuesday's State of the Union address. The encounter took place ahead of President Joe Biden's speech, as Mr Santos shook hands with people near Mr Romney's seat. Mr Romney later told reporters that he believed Mr Santos ""should be sitting in the back row"".  Mr Santos has admitted to fabricating large parts of his CV and biography. He has faced calls to resign from his New York constituents and a number of senior Republican colleagues in Congress.  Before President Biden's address, Mr Romney saw Mr Santos and said ""you ought to be embarrassed"". Mr Santos then shot back, and called Mr Romney an ""asshole"".  After the annual address, Mr Romney told reporters that Mr Santos ""shouldn't be in Congress"". ""I didn't expect him to be standing there trying to shake hands with every senator and the president of the United States,"" Mr Romney said.  ""Given the fact that he's under ethics investigation, he should be sitting in the back row and staying quiet instead of parading in front of the president and the people coming into the room,"" he said. Mr Romney added that if Mr Santos ""had any shame at all, he wouldn't be there."" After the speech, Mr Santos responded to Mr Romney - who was the Republican nominee for president in 2012 - in a tweet, saying ""just a reminder that you will NEVER be PRESIDENT!"" as he endorsed Donald Trump's 2024 presidential bid. Mr Santos, who was elected in the November midterm election, has been accused of lying about his education, his assets and his background. In an interview with the New York Post, Mr Santos admitted to ""embellishing"" his CV.  But Mr Romney hit out against the congressman's apology, telling reporters that ""embellishing is saying you got an A when you got an A-minus. Lying is saying you graduated from a college you didn't even attend"".  Other allegations have emerged against Mr Santos, including fraud charges in Brazil, where he is accused of stealing $700 in cheques under a fake name. A former aide has also accused him of sexual misconduct.  Mr Santos is also facing multiple investigations over his campaign spending and financial reports. He has previously denied wrongdoing.

Jolene Bunting disqualified as councillor after Britain First row,"A former councillor accused of doctoring a payslip in a bid to get money from a far-right group has been disqualified from becoming a councillor for three years. At an adjudication hearing of Northern Ireland's local government watchdog, Jolene Bunting was found to have breached the code of conduct. Her actions were branded ""dishonest, deliberate and for personal gain"". It followed a complaint from Britain First leader Paul Golding. He claimed Ms Bunting, a former independent unionist councillor, had asked him to cover the cost of a fine she received from Belfast City Council in 2018 for a publicity stunt at Belfast City Hall involving Britain First's deputy leader at the time, Jayda Fransen. But the fine was, in fact, due to Ms Bunting exceeding the data usage on her council mobile phone. The hearing of the Local Government Commissioner for Standards was told Ms Bunting had ""amended her payslip in order to achieve financial gain from Mr Golding and Britain First"".  It heard she had sent Mr Golding an image of her payslip as proof of a £545 deduction that had been taken from her monthly council allowance - but the image had been altered to obscure words explaining that the fee was for the then councillor's mobile phone. Ms Bunting, who declined to attend the hearing, previously denied she was responsible for altering the image. In an earlier interview with investigators, she denied the allegations against her. Assistant commissioner Ian Gordon, who made the findings against Ms Bunting, told the hearing: ""Her actions were dishonest, deliberate and for personal gain. Her actions have brought her and her role as a councillor into disrepute."" He added, however, that Ms Bunting's actions had not brought Belfast City Council itself into disrepute. Mr Golding told the BBC he intended to send a bundle of evidence - including the doctored payslip and text exchanges with Ms Bunting - to the Police Service of Northern Ireland.   In her closing remarks Rachel Best, counsel for the deputy commissioner who investigated Ms Bunting, said the case ""strikes at the heart of public confidence in councillors"". Ms Best outlined ""a plethora of aggravating factors"" in the case, including Ms Bunting's ""deliberate personal gain at public expense by exploiting her position of councillor"". She told the hearing Ms Bunting had brought herself into disrepute as a councillor, which had a wider impact on public confidence.  Ms Best said Ms Bunting had continued to deny the facts despite ""clear evidence"" and had challenged the investigation and adjudication until the end.  She added that Ms Bunting had ""sought to unfairly blame others"", particularly Mr Golding, and that she had shown no remorse for her actions and offered no apology.  Ms Bunting had made a last-ditch attempt to halt the proceedings.  Referencing an email she sent to the watchdog on the final day of the hearing, Mr Gordon said he accepted that she had been under ""significant financial pressure at the time"". However, he said he had considered all of the evidence and found that she had breached the councillors' code of conduct in a number of ways - including bringing her position into disrepute and improperly using her position to secure financial advantage.

Conservation: Dog sniffs out rats to protect Wales' seabirds,"A dog has been trained to protect Wales' seabirds by sniffing out rats who hunt eggs, chicks and adult birds.  Jinx, a three-year-old working cocker spaniel, is said to be the UK's first conservation detection dog.  He has been training with the RSPB for two years and will be used on islands around Wales to sniff out brown rats. The Welsh government has provided £250,000 as part of the two-year biosecurity for Wales project funded via the nature networks fund. The aim is to ensure seabird colonies on islands are protected from predators.  A single pregnant rat can produce a colony of more than 300 in just eight months. Without any action, experts fear they could rapidly decimate the important populations of breeding seabirds in Wales. Wales' coastline is globally important for breeding seabirds - more than half of the world's Manx shearwater nest underground in burrows on islands that dot the shores.  However, the seabirds are in trouble and recent Birds of Conservation Concern in Wales report highlighted how vital it was to protect puffins, kittiwakes and black-headed gulls, along with common, arctic and sandwich terns. Emily Williams, RSPB Cymru's senior marine policy officer, said: ""Biosecurity is a vital element of seabird conservation at a time when seabirds need our help more than ever. ""Coupled with the developing welsh seabird conservation strategy and marine environmental planning, we can turn the tide for seabirds in Wales."" Climate Change Minister Julie James said Jinx was the UK's first biosecurity dog. She said: ""Thanks to the intense training he completed with his expert handler, Greg, we are confident that the biosecurity on our islands will be greatly improved under his service.""

Ukraine war: President Volodymyr Zelensky visits the UK,"On Wednesday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky made a surprise trip to the UK to speak in Westminster Hall and meet King Charles at Buckingham Palace. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak shared a warm embrace with Mr Zelensky when he arrived at Stansted Airport (above). The two leaders waved outside Downing Street, before heading inside. Mr Sunak then headed to the Commons for the weekly Prime Minster's Questions. In his opening words, he said he was ""delighted"" that Mr Zelensky was visiting the UK. He said it is ""testament to the unbreakable friendship"" between the UK and Ukraine. Later on, Mr Zelensky met Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle and Speaker of the House of Lords, Lord McFall (above and below). Mr Zelensky signed the guestbook at Speaker's House in the Palace of Westminster. He also met Sir Keir Starmer, leader of the Labour Party. Mr Zelensky arrived on stage in Westminster Hall and was met with rapturous applause. Sir Lindsay introduced Mr Zelensky and reflected on an afternoon tea the pair shared in October 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic. ""Little did we know our relationship would grow in such turbulent times,"" Sir Lindsay said. He spoke about the first speech, made virtually, by Mr Zelensky to the Commons last March, describing the atmosphere as ""electrifying"". He said Parliament was ""honoured you put yourself at risk to address us"" in person on Wednesday. Mr Zelensky then spoke in English and said he was there to represent Ukrainian warriors, ""on behalf of our war heroes who are in the trenches protecting Ukraine against enemy missiles"". Mr Zelensky thanked the UK for providing equipment to his soldiers and training for those on the front line, and said the UK has been standing with Kyiv ""since day one"". The leader then presented Sir Lindsay with a Ukrainian fighter pilot's helmet. The pilot it belonged to is ""one of the most successful aces, and he's one of our kings"", Mr Zelensky said. The writing on the helmet reads ""we have freedom, give us wings to protect it"". The president then travelled to Buckingham Palace to meet King Charles. The two men were pictured standing together as the King held an audience with the Ukrainian president - the first time they had met in person. All images subject to copyright.

Blaenau Gwent: All children's play areas could close to cut costs,"A council has proposed closing all its children's play areas to cut costs ahead of its new budget.  Blaenau Gwent council outlined the proposal in an online survey for residents to vote on potential reductions.  Other options include moving black bin collections to once a month and stopping support for Armistice parades. The council said it was ""engaging with residents"" and final decisions will be made ""later this month"". Youth Sport Trust, a children's sports charity, called play areas ""vitally important"" spaces for children to stay active and healthy, no matter their age or ability.  ""It's vital every child has the opportunity to take part in sport and play to form healthy habits for life,"" it said. The funding the council receives from the Welsh government will increase by 6.5% for 2023-24 - the lowest increase in Wales - leaving a £6.7m gap in the council's finances.  The proposal to close play areas - which the council said would save £50,000 - would see all outdoor play areas, multi-use games areas and wheeled sports areas shut.  The council has also suggested saving £2,400 by ""ceasing support"" for Armistice parades and a further £252,000 by reducing council funding to individual schools.  Other cost cutting proposals and potential savings:  The council has also proposed reducing the budget for council members' allowances, potentially saving £50,000. It said that council tax currently makes up just over 22% of its overall budget, the second lowest percentage in Wales.  Residents were also asked how acceptable they would find a 4% increase to their council tax.  ""It gives them the space to express themselves, learn, form friendships and a sense of belonging,"" said a spokesperson for Youth Sport Trust, which works alongside Sport Wales.  ""Sport Wales research recently showed that 36% (111,000) pupils reported 'no frequent participation' in organised sport outside of the curriculum with many participating less than once a week."" A spokesperson for the council said: ""The council is facing a range of financial pressures which has resulted in a significant funding gap, and we have put together a series of savings and efficiencies proposals to try and address this shortfall.  ""It's important we get out and engage with people in our communities so that we can explain in more detail the scale of the challenge and the difficult decisions we are facing. ""[Closing play areas] is just one proposal in a series of savings ideas put forward which councillors will make the final decisions on later this month.""

Presbyterian Church: Next moderator opposed to women ministers,"The next moderator of the Presbyterian Church has said he is against the ordination of women even though it is church policy. The Reverend Sam Mawhinney said it was a personal view and he respected the church's stance on the issue.  He told BBC News NI he had no desire to offend or to hurt people. He will take up the most senior position in the church in June, after being elected to the one-year position on Tuesday evening. Dr Mawhinney is based at Adelaide Road Presbyterian in Dublin city centre and is the first moderator from the Republic of Ireland to be elected in almost a quarter of a century. Asked if he supported a united Ireland, he said allegiance to the ""kingdom"" of Jesus Christ was his priority, but he would like to see a ""more open dialogue"" between nationalists and unionists. ""I'm not afraid of that debate,"" he added. ""I just think we need to be more open about it."" He said he hoped to bring an ""all-Ireland perspective"" to his year as moderator. He also said he believed his background as a qualified doctor, before entering the ministry, would help him in terms of pastoral care. The moderator serves for one year, starting in June, and the Reverend John Kirkpatrick from Portrush Presbyterian is currently in the role. The 19 regional presbyteries elect the moderator and Dr Mawhinney won by 10 votes to nine, ahead of the Reverend Richard Murray, the minister of Drumreagh Presbyterian Church in County Antrim. Since Ireland was partitioned in 1921, only nine moderators have been from south of the border, Dr Mawhinney will be the 10th. Rev Mawhinney, 60, spent his early years Ballycastle, County Antrim.  He is the 178th moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, a position first filled in 1840. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64574746
Turkey-Syria earthquake: UK charities to launch DEC disaster appeal,"An appeal is being launched by the UK's Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) to help hundreds of thousands of people affected by an earthquake in Turkey and Syria. UK aid agencies - including the British Red Cross, Oxfam and ActionAid - are joining together to raise money. Funds will go towards medical aid, emergency shelter, food and clean water after the quake left thousands injured. More than 11,000 people have died, with that number expected to rise. Thousands of buildings have been destroyed in the disaster and responders have been searching the rubble for survivors. Many people have lost homes, leaving them without shelter in freezing, winter conditions, the DEC says.  In Syria, some people who were already living in tents after fleeing conflict in the country are now hosting those whose homes have been destroyed by the quake. The charities say access to clean water is going to be difficult in the coming days, and will bring the risk of waterborne diseases. The UK government will match the first £2m of donations from the public. Money raised will also provide blankets, warm clothes and heaters for safe spaces.  DEC chief executive Saleh Saeed described the scenes in Turkey and Syria as ""heartbreaking"", with thousands ""losing loved ones suddenly in the most shocking of ways"". He said: ""We know that money is tight for many people here in the UK as the cost of living crisis continues but, if you can, please do donate to support people caught up in this deadly disaster."" Salah Aboulgasem, from the Islamic Relief charity, based in Gazientep, Turkey, added: ""The priority right now is saving lives by clearing the rubble. The next priority is supporting people who have lost their homes and gone through huge trauma.  ""People need medicines and warmth. There is a lot of screaming, people are trying to find relatives. A lot of people are sleeping in cars because they are scared to go back into the buildings due to aftershocks."" Fourteen of the DEC's 15 members are either responding, or planning to respond, in Turkey and Syria and will receive funds from the appeal. The DEC has previously launched similar appeals to raise funds for victims of the Pakistan floods and for Ukrainians displaced by the war with Russia. The appeal will be broadcast on the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky on Thursday evening.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64568254
LeBron James' NBA record: How will it help British basketball?,"For a lot of British NBA fans it was a very early start to watch LeBron James become the NBA's all-time leading scorer. 03:00 GMT to be exact.  James scored 38 points to overtake Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's long-standing record of 38,387, which was set in 1989. The LA Lakers actually lost the match - not that anyone remembers - but their star man now sits on top with 38,390. But will his feat help basketball in Great Britain? ""These historic moments will hopefully have a trickle down effect,"" basketball journalist Huw Hopkins tells BBC Newsbeat. ""It's great for the game over here.  ""So it will engage people who might have been playing basketball at school. It's said to be the second most played team sport among teenagers in the UK."" The British Basketball League has seen a rise in attendances - with the play-off final's selling out last year. ""The premier team at the moment is the London Lions, both the men's and women's side, they've recently had some an injection of cash with new ownership,"" Huw says. ""And they're bringing in former NBA players and NBA level players."" The British Basketball League has already received a boost in recent years. A business group from Miami - who own the London Lions team - purchased a 45% stake in it for £7m in December 2021. The men's team is also captained by former Love Islander Ovie Soko. ""Hopefully if people are inspired by this, they might reach out to local clubs and and they can play the game outside of school, college or university,"" Huw says. James' own impact on the UK sports scene is already pretty significant. The Lakers' star has shares in Premier League side Liverpool - repping them loads on social media. Josh Coyne, from YouTube channel House of Bounce, says James is usually the ""entry point"" for people getting into the sport in the UK. ""There was real hype last year over here in the UK because both of LeBron's son's (Bronny and Bryce James) played in a college basketball game in London,"" he says. ""That arena was completely full.  ""A large part of that was the fact that people thought LeBron might be in attendance at the game - he wasn't and the event was fantastic anyway.""

The Hardwick: Kent man denies part in restaurant theft,"The husband of a bookkeeper who stole £150,000 from a former Michelin star chef has told a court he had ""no idea"" his bank account was used in the fraud. More than £46,000 was paid into the account of Simon Nightingale, 50, of Deal, Kent, by his wife Nicola. He denies acquiring criminal property from The Hardwick restaurant in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire. Mrs Nightingale has already pleaded guilty to fraud by abuse of position at Cardiff Crown Court. She worked as an administrator at the restaurant owned by Stephen Terry, who trained under celebrity chef Marco Pierre White. The couple got back together after a three-year separation shortly before Mrs Nightingale took the restaurant job, the court heard. Between February 2018 and May 2020, she transferred £150,000 into different accounts, including £46,741 to her husband's current account. Mr Nightingale, an executive chef, told the court he often worked away during the week so his wife ""took charge"" of his bank account, into which her wages were also paid. He said her wage varied and he did not know what she earned.  Asked whether he ever questioned his wife over any payments into the account, which varied between £100 and £1,617, he replied: ""I had no need to. Nicola told me it was her wages. The figure, over a period of time, is not scary."" He accepted the ""vast majority of the £46,000 was not meant"" for him, but said he had been unable to distinguish between his and his wife's wages. Asked whether it would have been easy to question his wife, he said: ""No. I didn't want to wake the bear and end up in the same situation as we were before."" Mr Nightingale said he was ""disappointed and disgusted"" when he learned from police of his wife's crime. Despite the account being regularly overdrawn, the couple, who had five children, went on holidays to Florida, Morocco and France. Mr Nightingale said he ""trusted"" his wife to book the trips and did not believe the holidays to be outside their means.  Thomas Stanway, prosecuting, also put to Mr Nightingale that there was ""twice as much money"" coming into the household than was being earned. He replied: ""Not that I was aware of. In reality now, we know that, but at the time I was not aware.""  The trial continues. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64568329
Children revel in first visually-impaired rugby event,"A visually-impaired (VI) rugby day has been held at Cardiff Arms Park, the first event of its kind in the UK.The event, organised by Cardiff Rugby Foundation and RNIB, is said to be a huge milestone for the game.Dozens of children from schools across south Wales attended. For Gareth Davies who is registered blind and plays for the adult VI Rugby team in Cardiff, the day was emotional.   Wales' first visually impaired drag queenHow do visually impaired people play video games?How does tennis work when you're blind? “It’s incredibly special, with my own sight loss journey five years ago, there were only a handful of people playing, now we have 70 children playing on one of the biggest pitches in the world,"" said  Gareth, 48, who was diagnosed with a condition called retina pigmentosa, external. “It means my peripheral vision shrinks, and I now just have 10% good vision, everything else is just a blur and it also means I can’t see in the dark. He was diagnosed when he was 19, with his eyesight degenerating over the years, but seven years ago this took a real drop and he was registered blind.“It had a significant impact on me – there was a lot of fear and anxiety about my future, it affected me socially, I didn’t want to go out.“I would say it had quite a detrimental effect on me.”  Being registered blind meant he could no longer play the sport he loved, and it was only by chance that he came across the world of VI rugby.“A friend told me about a visual impairment team at Harlequins that had just been set up, I was living in Cardiff at the time so would travel down on the train every month to get back involved in rugby.”He then set up a team in Cardiff, and set about establishing VI rugby in Wales. He organised the Arms Park event after feeling that visually impaired people had been slightly left behind when it comes to inclusion in sport.“If we look at wheelchair rugby, and deaf rugby, the game has really developed, and that’s fantastic – they have some really good, solid foundations in Wales and around the world, but rugby for visually impaired people is still lagging behind.“What we’re trying to do is close that gap, and get a really high quality provision for everybody living in Wales living with sight loss.”  “A lot of these children and young people have been told they can’t play rugby or feel they can’t play with their peers, so what we’re doing here is creating a pathway to give blind and partially sighted children an opportunity to continue playing their rugby journey.“Today’s event is not only the first event of its kind in Wales, or in the UK, but as far as we know in the world – to have 70 blind or partially sighted children play rugby is a first.“What we would really want is to work with the governing bodies in rugby, stakeholders and the regions, so any young person in Wales who has sight loss has the opportunity to play the national game we all love.”  Cardiff Rugby is the country’s only visual impairment team, and for the community foundation director, Nadine Griffiths, the event was important. “It’s all about really breaking down the barriers to ensure there are opportunities for anybody to participate and enjoy the sport. “We started in 2019 with a visual impairment team, and now it is vitally important for us to provide a pathway, so that children coming through can participate in sport. She added that everyone had a part to play, and hopefully the sport will grow with other regions coming on board allowing everyone to participate.“It’s really important that we all live by, 'there is a jersey for all, every single person should have an opportunity to engage, not just in rugby but in sport in general'.”  Most of the young people at the event had a visual impairment.Harvey, 10, who is blind in his left eye, said: “I didn’t think I could play because of my visual impairment, but today’s been great.”  Jacob, 12, who struggles to see out of his right eye, said anyone with a visual impairment should be able to play, and he hopes to play for Wales.Rugby is 11-year-old Liberty’s favourite sport: “It’s amazing the fact that people can still play rugby when they have a disability in their eye, this was a once in a lifetime opportunity,” she said.  Cai Emlyn, 27, who got involved in the sport when Cardiff Rugby had their taster session in 2019, was born with a genetic disorder called neurofibromatosis, external, and lost most of his sight when he was nine. “I played rugby as a kid, but as my vision got worse I struggled to play, the game became too hard for me to keep up and cope physically.“It was difficult giving up the sport, but it’s fantastic that they have VI rugby in Cardiff – it shows rugby is just not for sighted people and everyone can play the sport.  “Hopefully this can be a regular thing and there will be a provision for kids with sight loss, it would be fantastic to grow the sport across Wales so each region had a team, and fingers crossed maybe even get a Wales team set up to get to the VI World Cup.  Director of RNIB Cymru Ansley Workman said: “This has been a partnership with the RNIB and the community foundation to make sure VI kids can get the opportunity to go out there and try rugby and see it’s a game for everyone.   ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c88d59rygx1o

Sheku Bayoh inquiry told of 'traumatic' house search by police,"A woman has told of her ""traumatic nightmare"" when police searched her family's home in the aftermath of Sheku Bayoh's death.  Mr Bayoh died after being restrained by police in Kirkcaldy, Fife, in May 2015. Saadia Rashid's brother Zahid Saeed had been with him earlier that morning. She told an inquiry that her family's house was searched without a warrant. Mrs Rashid also said they were discriminated against because they are Muslim and Pakistani.  The inquiry is looking into the circumstances of Mr Bayoh's death, and whether race was a factor. Mrs Rashid told a hearing in Edinburgh that two officers initially arrived at her mother's house, where she was staying, at about 08:00 on Sunday May 3. She said they told her they were looking for her brother, and they left when she said he was not there. About an hour later, she said a number of uniformed officers came to the house along with one in a suit who told her the family needed to leave as officers were looking for evidence and had to search the house. Mrs Rashid told the inquiry: ""I asked for a warrant. He didn't have one."" In written evidence, the witness said: ""They said they didn't need a warrant, that we had to vacate now, they said we didn't have a choice and we had to let them in because this was a crime scene and they had to seal... and search the house"". Mrs Rashid said no explanation was given as to why officers needed to search the property, or why it was considered a crime scene. The witness said she had come to her mother's house for rest after an emergency C-section when her baby was born and instead that day endured a ""traumatic, nightmare experience that was uncalled for"". In her inquiry statement she also said the family ""felt almost like we were being treated differently because we were Pakistani and Muslims"". Asked what it was about the officers' behaviour that made her feel this way, Mrs Rashid said: ""The fact that we were Muslims and wearing hijab, we were quite vulnerable at the time, had that been anyone else they would have been treated differently."" The witness said she explained to officers that she could not leave as another of her brothers, a paralysed war veteran, was in a wheelchair and she and her elderly mother could not move him on their own. She told officers she also had two young children, aged two months and one-and-a-half. However she said they did not offer any assistance and did nothing to help. She told the inquiry that she then packed ""in panic mode"", feeling rushed, and later discovered she had left things behind including breast pumps, expressed milk and medication. Mrs Rashid said officers told her she could not go back into the house to collect them. She said the family were treated with no compassion and the experience left them feeling like ""second-class citizens"". Later, she told the Edinburgh hearing she was also not aware of anything that would connect Mr Bayoh to the house. The inquiry also heard from Mrs Rashid's father Saeed Ahmed, who came to the house to help after his daughter rang to tell him what was happening. He said police initially would not let him into the house even though he told them he was a carer for his son. Police ultimately let him in after some discussion amongst officers. The inquiry, before Lord Bracadale, continues.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-64572048
Cwm: Football field badly damaged by quad bikes,"A pitch used by a junior football team has been badly damaged after a meet of bikes and vehicles was organised to feature in a music video. Volunteers have set up a £3,500 fundraiser to repair the damage to Betterment Park in Cwm, Blaenau Gwent.  The rapper Dight 23 said he was not involved and was ""shocked and disappointed"" at the behaviour. Gwent Police said they are making inquiries to identify those responsible.   Police were called to the field on Sunday after reports of damage being caused to the football pitch by people on off-road bikes. Alex Price, of RTB Ebbw Vale Junior FC, said the club was devastated.  ""The area is a skatepark and a park. It's for kids. Why would you target an area which is specifically for children to use and enjoy?  ""They've not only destroyed the pitch, all the grass around the skatepark is destroyed as well so they've just completely ruined the whole area and it just spoils it for the children. ""It's not fair because Ebbw Vale is a quite rundown area and there isn't a lot as it is for the children. That's why it's so important to have these grassroots clubs for these kids to have somewhere to spend their time and to have somewhere to look forward to.""  She said volunteers maintain the field which is rented from the council. ""They work really hard to get the pitch to where it is today. To see that be destroyed so quickly, it was really disheartening."" Ms Price explained the pitch would have to be re-turfed and so the weekend's football matches have had to be rearranged. ""A lot of our income is from selling teas and coffees at our home matches which we can't do now. We can't even recuperate that now because we can't use those facilities,"" she added.  Ms Price explained a dog walker had taken photos and videos of the incident and posted it online.  ""A few young kids in the area had been telling their parents it was a rapper who was doing a music video and videos started circulating of the event that had taken place down there"", she said.  Dight 23, a rapper from Cwm, posted an invitation on social media asking people with dirt bikes and vehicles to meet on 5 February to feature in his music video.  The Welsh rapper, who has 23 monthly listeners on Spotify and 341 followers on Facebook said when he and the photographer turned up at the location, the damage had already been done to the field.  ""It ruined things for me in a way because by the time we got there, there was already a mess there,"" he said.  The rapper said the football pitch had been torn up by local kids on quad bikes.  Videos have circulated on social media showing dirt bikes and quad bikes kicking up the turf both on the football pitch and the green space next to the skate park.  The 23 year-old said: ""They were all there for me, there's no denying that. ""But they've all got their own brains and they were all told to behave and I didn't tell them to do anything."" He has been criticised on social media, but he said: ""They're targeting me because they don't have anyone else to target. ""It's been blown right out of proportion and I've been made to look like the villain."" He said he originally posted to meet at Cwm field, but deleted the post afterward.  However information ""got out"" and by the time he arrived there were about 30 young people on foot who had come to watch, as well as people with dirt bikes. Dight 23 explained he and his friends moved location to shoot his music video and none of the footage is of Betterment Park.  The rapper also said he is happy to ""donate a couple hundred pounds to help"". ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64569358
King's Lynn woman guilty of trying to hire hitman after fling,"A woman who tried to hire a hitman to kill a former work colleague after a fling has been found guilty of soliciting murder. Helen Hewlett, 44, of King's Lynn in Norfolk, paid £17,000 as a deposit to a website used for recruiting contract killers, her trial heard. She was arrested after police linked her to payments made to the site. The court heard her target was a 50-year-old colleague with whom she had become infatuated after a brief affair. The jury was told Hewlett had placed an order on the dark web stating ""need someone killed in Norfolk"", adding it was ""vital it looks like an accident"". The pair met when they worked at the Linda McCartney Frozen Food factory in Fakenham and had a kiss in his car. During the trial, the victim, who is not being identified, said Hewlett had ""become obsessed with him"" and over a period of two years until August 2022 she bombarded him with emails and texts, urging him to meet her. These included sexual images and videos of herself. When he left to work at the nearby Kinnerton chocolate factory, Hewlett managed to secure a job there too.   While at Kinnerton, the court heard Hewlett filed two complaints against the man to his employers, accusing him of harassment, homophobia and racial abuse.   The firm told the man there was no case to answer, and he was advised to go to the police. Asked by prosecutor, Marti Blair, why he eventually went to the police, he said: ""I just wanted it to stop. I just wanted to be left alone."" The court heard the police visited Hewlett and she stopped trying to make contact with her victim for a few days, but she resumed emailing soon afterwards saying she was ""sorry"". Prior to posting the request on the website, Hewlett placed money into an escrow third-party account. In her attempt to find a killer, she gave the victim's home and work address and other personal details, the court heard. Hewlett took out a number of loans to pay for the hitman, but investigators were unable to say if the cash went to a potential hitman, or if the online killers market site was a scam. The defendant was cleared of stalking, involving fear or violence to cause serious alarm or distress, but she was found guilty of a lesser charge of stalking, without serious alarm or distress, between January 2021 and August 2022. She is awaiting sentencing. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Strikes: Wales' NHS and education staff get new pay offers,"Striking public sector workers in Wales have received new pay offers from the Welsh government.  Health minister Eluned Morgan said talks with unions representing nurses, midwives, physiotherapists and ambulance staff have now finished. The improved offers will now be put to union members, but Unite said it was not enough to call off its strikes. Meanwhile, National Education Union (NEU) Cymru also confirmed it had received a revised pay offer. The Welsh government said that, in addition to a 5% pay rise, the revised pay offer for NEU members comprised an additional 3% this year and 1.5% going forwards. It added that it also included ""a number of significant non-pay commitments relating to workload in the short, medium and long term"".  David Evans, Wales secretary of NEU Cymru, said members would be ""pleased that the Welsh government continues to take negotiations seriously"". He added: ""These were the fullest discussions we've had so far, so yes, progress is being made. It is still far short of our demands, but we will make decisions on that in the not too distant future."" Meanwhile, the GMB, which represents about a quarter of Welsh ambulance staff, said it would give its members until 17 February to decide whether to accept or reject the latest offer, ahead of planned industrial action three days later. Nathan Holman, GMB Welsh lead, said members would be sent the updated offer and an online ballot on Thursday. Other unions may take longer to consult with members as they do not have the same deadline of a strike day. On Tuesday, Unite announced it would hold further strike days on 20, 21 and 22 February, despite the new offer.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64568330

'Naughty' beavers steal wildlife webcam for lodge,"""Naughty"" beavers have removed a webcam set up to monitor their activities at a wildlife centre in Perthshire. The venue in Doune, Argaty Red Kites, has about a dozen beavers after they were relocated from other parts of Scotland. Over the weekend, owners were left puzzled by why their ""beaver cam"" was showing a close-up of sticks and mud. They said the animals had knocked down the wooden pole holding the camera and dragged it to the roof of their lodge. The webcam has been recovered and re-installed, but the centre said the wooden pole might need to replaced with a metal one. Beavers are a protected species. They were once native to Scotland before becoming extinct in the 16th Century. The animals found today include beavers reintroduced under licence, and others illegally released on to Scottish rivers. Beavers construct their homes, known as a lodge, from branches and mud. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-64568405
Turkey earthquake: What can people in Wales do to help?,"More than 11,000 people have been killed and thousands injured since south-east Turkey was hit by a massive earthquake this week. Striking near Gaziantep, it was followed by multiple aftershocks, one almost as large as the first. In some of the worst-hit areas, families have said rescue efforts have been too slow, leaving them to find relatives without help. As people watch events unfold they are starting to ask what they can do. The Welsh Centre for International Affairs is urging people to donate to groups already at the scene. It said this should be done through established organisations including the British Syrian Medical Society, Islamic Relief in Turkey and Syria, Oxfam in Turkey and Syria and the British Red Cross with Red Crescent.  The organisation urged people only to send money saying: ""WCIA strongly encourage people in Wales to focus on donating funds rather than clothing and other items, which can be impossible to transport and distribute and may undermine co-ordination of local aid efforts on the ground."" Funds, it said, would reach those on the ground fastest so they can get survivors what they need most - medical treatment, shelter and clothing. Islamic Relief's Salah Aboulgasem, based in Gazientep, Turkey, said: ""The priority right now is saving lives by clearing the rubble. ""The next priority is supporting people who have lost their homes and gone through huge trauma. People need medicines and warmth."" When catastrophes such as earthquakes happen, the Disasters Emergency Committee normally asks for help. An umbrella group of UK charities, it makes collective appeals to raise funds for aid and relief to those caught in disasters and humanitarian crises. It has announced its appeal will be officially launched on Thursday. It believes 380,000 people had sought refuge in government shelters or hotels.  On its website, it said: ""Immediate priorities are medical treatment for the injured, shelter for those who have lost their homes, heating in safe spaces, blankets, warm clothes and ensuring people have food and clean water."" Televised appeals will be broadcast on the BBC, ITV, S4C, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky on Thursday and BBC radio appeals will be broadcast through the day.  DEC chief executive Saleh Saeed said: ""The devastation in Turkey and Syria is heart-breaking, with thousands of people losing loved ones suddenly in the most shocking of ways.   ""Funds are urgently needed to support families with medical aid, emergency shelter, food and clean water in freezing, snowy conditions."" Firefighters from across the UK, including Mid and West Wales, and South Wales Fire and Rescue Service, are heading to Turkey to help. A dog detection team from Penmaenmawr, Conwy county, had been hoping to go out to help but were stood down on Tuesday. Swansea University psychology professor Filiz Celik's family live in Adana, Turkey, which has been devastated by the earthquake. She woke up to find her phone pinging with texts, but has since found out her family are all OK.  But there are friends she cannot reach because phones have gone dead and there is no way of charging them.  Prof Celik is now collecting money to send to help and wants to go out and help at some point to offer help as a psychologist. ""I'm going to talk to my employers perhaps to take an extended leave and go,"" she said. The Newport Diyanet Education Community Centre, a Turkish group, has sent two vans and a lorry full of donations and is now focusing on collecting funds because of difficulties in transporting donations.  The centre's Cagri Coskun said: ""We are trying to send money so they can source blankets, generators and whatever else they need from over there.  ""There are various charities in the UK in contact with search and rescue teams so money can go to people on the ground."" In Cwmbran, Torfaen, dance teacher Beckie Forrest has also been collecting donations.  The family of her husband, Selman Han, are from Turkey but are OK.  The mum-of-two, 33, said she was organising a raffle and was concentrating on raising cash.  ""The response has been amazing, we have had so many people donate,"" she said. Mohammed Alhadj Ali, from the Syrian Welsh Society, called the situation ""catastrophic"". He said: ""They need medical aid, they need shelters, help and support to get people out of rooms."" The UK government will match the first £2m of donations from the British public to the DEC's Turkey-Syria Earthquake Appeal as part of a wider support package. It said this was in addition to ongoing UK aid to Syria and Turkey. Foreign secretary James Cleverly said: ""When disasters like these terrible earthquakes strike, we know the British people want to help."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64568419
Lockerbie bombing suspect pleads not guilty in US court,"The man accused of building the explosive used in the Lockerbie bombing has pleaded not guilty in a US court. Abu Agila Masud is alleged to have been involved in downing Pan Am flight 103 over the Scottish town in 1988 - killing 270 people. He is charged with two counts of destruction of an aircraft resulting in death and a count of destruction of a vehicle resulting in death. The Libyan pleaded not guilty to all three in a federal court in Washington. Each of the charges Mr Masud faces are punishable by a sentence of up to life imprisonment, the death penalty or a fine of up to $250,000 (£206,000). A previous hearing in December heard that Mr Masud will not face the death penalty because the bombing occurred before the specific charges which he faces carried a possible penalty of capital punishment. A further hearing was fixed for later in February for Judge Moxila Upadhyaya to hear arguments on whether Mr Masud should be detained or released for trial. In December, US officials announced that Mr Masud, who allegedly worked as an intelligence agent for the country's former dictator Muammar Gaddafi, had been taken into custody. It came two years after it emerged he had been charged in connection with the explosion. In 2020, he was charged by US Attorney General William Barr with being the third person involved in the terrorist attack. The Lockerbie bombing remains Britain's deadliest terrorist attack. All 259 people on board the jumbo jet bound to New York from London on December 21, 1988, were killed.  Another 11 people were killed in Lockerbie when wreckage destroyed their homes. In 2001 Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was convicted of bombing the flight after standing trial at a specially convened Scottish court in the Netherlands. He was the only man to be convicted over the attack. Megrahi was jailed for life but was released on compassionate grounds by the Scottish government in 2009 after being diagnosed with cancer. He died in Libya in 2012.

Two children dead after bus rams into Quebec nursery,"Two children were killed and six others were injured when a bus rammed into a nursery in Quebec, Canada, police say. The 51-year-old bus driver, who was an employee of the local public transit system, has been arrested and charged with homicide and reckless driving. Police told the BBC they were first alerted to the crash at about 08:30 local time (13:00 GMT) on Wednesday. The exact circumstances of the incident, which happened in the Montreal suburb of Laval, are unclear. ""We do not know why he did it, and the motive of the crime right now is still under investigation,"" Laval police spokeswoman Erika Landry said. One eyewitness, Hamdi Ben Chaabane, said the driver exited the bus after the crash, took off his clothes and began acting erratically.  Some children were caught under the vehicle's wheels, he said. ""It was a nightmare. It's horrible. He didn't stop yelling. He wasn't saying words."" The nursery is located on a quiet cul-de-sac in Laval and police cordoned off the area on Wednesday afternoon. A crisis centre has been set up nearby to help parents and families, police said.  Quebec Premier François Legault told local media: ""All my thoughts are with the children, with the parents and with the employees."" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is from Montreal, said his thoughts were ""with families in Laval who are living incredibly difficult moments. We hope that everyone will be OK"".

Canada pledges billions to help fix healthcare system,"The Canadian government has pledged nearly CAD $200bn ($149bn; £124bn) in funding over 10 years to aid the country's ailing healthcare system.  The funding was pitched as a generational fix for the system in an announcement on Tuesday. For months, Canada's hospitals have grappled with a lack of staff and lengthy wait times for care.  A few reports have since emerged of patients dying while awaiting treatment. Canada's healthcare system is funded by the taxpayer to offer free, universal access to necessary hospital and doctor visits for all citizens and permanent residents. It is paid for using a mix of federal and provincial money, but administered at the local level. Around 25% of funding is from the federal government through the Canada Health Transfer.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made the funding pitch to Canada's provincial premiers, who have repeatedly pushed Mr Trudeau to increase federal spending on healthcare.  Mr Trudeau, however, had said he would not increase funding without strings attached.  Following a meeting with the premiers on Tuesday, Mr Trudeau said that his government is ""taking action today so Canadians can continue to have trust in our public system."" ""This is a big country, built on big progressive ideas,"" he said. ""Few are more central to who we are as Canadians than the promise of universal, publicly funded healthcare."" His proposal includes a total of $196.1bn to be spent on healthcare over the course of a decade - $46.2bn of which is new money on top of what has already been budgeted.  The total amounts to around a 61% increase in the Canada Health Transfer to provinces over the next 10 years. It is less than what Canada's premiers wanted - they had asked Mr Trudeau for an annual top-up of $28bn.  Manitoba's premier, Heather Stefanson, said she was ""disappointed"" with the amount, meanwhile Ontario's premier, Doug Ford, called it a ""starting point"".  The premiers said they are now in the process of assessing the proposal.  Mr Trudeau said the money his government has put up is a ""major investment in healthcare"", but he added that money alone will not fix the country's faltering system.  He said he will also negotiate separate agreements with each province to address unique regional issues.  The government has also asked provinces for better healthcare data so they can assess the system's performance better.  Healthcare has often been a point of pride in Canada, but, like many other countries, its system has grappled with mounting pressure since the Covid-19 pandemic, with growing wait times to access care. In Nova Scotia, a 67-year-old woman reportedly died after giving up on a seven-hour wait to see a doctor at a local hospital's emergency department.  Patients have also been affected by a growing backlog for surgeries and diagnostic procedures.  Canada spends over 10% of its GDP on healthcare, about the same as the UK, compared with more than 16% for the US, according to World Bank data. Its healthcare system ranks higher than the US, but lower than the UK and others in some international comparisons.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64574072
Turkey earthquake: How do search and rescue teams save people?,"Thousands of people have been killed after a massive earthquake struck Turkey and Syria on Monday.  A search and rescue operation is under way, with specialist teams arriving from around the world.   However, people in some badly-hit areas say rescue efforts have been slow. Some have had to dig with their bare hands to find relatives. When rescuers first arrive at the scene of an earthquake, they assess which collapsed buildings are most likely to contain trapped people. They do this by looking for ""voids"" - spaces under large concrete beams or stairwells where survivors can be found.  The possibility a building could collapse further also needs to be taken into consideration, as do other dangers such as gas leaks, flooding and hazardous items, like asbestos in roofs.  While rescuers attempt to reach survivors, support workers watch for building movements and listen out for strange sounds. Buildings that have completely collapsed are usually the last to be searched, because the likelihood of finding survivors is very slim.  The work of rescue teams is co-ordinated by an agency, usually the United Nations (UN) and the host country. Rescuers are specially trained and work in pairs or bigger teams, while local people are often involved as well.  To shift rubble, rescue teams use heavy machinery - including diggers and hydraulic jacks. Large concrete slabs on the outside of buildings can be pulled aside by diggers, enabling rescuers to get a view of any people trapped inside. Video equipment on the end of flexible poles can be passed through gaps to help locate survivors.  Specialist sound equipment can detect the faintest of noises to within a few metres. Silence on the site is needed while a member of the rescue team bangs three times and hopes to hear a response.  Carbon dioxide detectors can be used to find survivors who are unconscious. They work best in confined spaces where they detect the greater CO2 concentration in the air exhaled by those still breathing. Thermal imaging equipment can be used to locate people not directly in a rescuer's line of sight, because their body heat can warm the rubble around them. Using their sense of smell, specially trained dogs can pick up on signs of life where human rescuers cannot. Dogs also able to cover large areas quickly, speeding up the search and rescue process. Once the large slabs and structures are removed, rescue teams use their hands and small tools like hammers, pickaxes and shovels, as well as chainsaws, disc-cutters and rebar cutters - which can be used to tackle the metal bars in reinforced concrete. They have protective equipment, including helmets and gloves to protect their hands as they remove sharp pieces of rubble.  However, in some areas of Turkey - where rescue efforts have been slow - local people have been digging through frozen wet rubble with their bare hands. Bedia Gucum, a restaurant owner in Adana in southern Turkey, told the BBC: ""We need strong work gloves to move that rubble by hand. Because once they hear somebody alive in there, all heavy machinery stops and they have to dig in with their hands, and that just is beyond human capabilities.  ""You need hands on site, and you need gloves for them."" This decision is taken between the UN co-ordinating agency and the host country's central and local government.  The search and rescue attempts are usually called off between five and seven days after a disaster, once no-one has been found alive for a day or two. However, people have been known to be rescued alive beyond this point. In 2010, a man was found alive after a reported 27 days trapped under the rubble, following an earthquake in Haiti.  In 2013, a woman was pulled from the ruins of a factory building in Bangladesh, 17 days after it collapsed. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-64569943
Post Office scandal: Woman's conviction for false accounting quashed,"A 77-year-old woman's conviction for falsifying accounts at her Post Office branch is to be quashed.

She was prosecuted over an alleged financial shortfall of up to £6,500. Lawyers for Mrs Fagan successfully argued that failures related to the Horizon IT scandal resulted in an abuse of process. Her name was cleared after it emerged that flaws in the accounting system had not been properly disclosed. The financial shortfall was discovered in 2014 at the Post Office branch where she worked. During interviews, Mrs Fagan denied ever taking any money, insisting there had been a fault with the Horizon payment system used by her employer. Horizon was introduced into the Post Office network from 1999. The system, developed by the Japanese company Fujitsu, was used for tasks such as transactions, accounting and stocktaking. Between 2000 and 2014, a flaw in the computer system made it look like money was missing from Post Office branches. It led to suspensions, termination of contracts, wrongful prosecutions and convictions. The Horizon IT scandal saw more than 700 people wrongly accused of theft, fraud and false accounting. It has been described as the most ""widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history"". Last year the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) invited Mrs Fagan to appeal her conviction after carrying out a review of her case. Mrs Fagan's barrister, Ronan Lavery KC, told the Court of Appeal there had been a failure to disclose the full extent of Horizon flaws during her trial. He argued there had been an abuse of process, rendering her conviction unsafe. Counsel for the PPS, Philip Henry, said it was not opposing the challenge or seeking a retrial. Based on those developments, Lord Justice Treacy confirmed: ""We allow the appeal and quash the conviction."" Outside court, Mrs Fagan's solicitor Anne-Marie Featherstone said the initial ruling had a ""traumatic impact"" on her client. ""Mrs Fagan is absolutely delighted with the outcome which means her name has finally been cleared,"" she said. ""She is just deeply saddened that her late husband is not alive to see this day.""

Former X Factor star Katie Waissel welcomes extra support for TV contestants,"Former X Factor contestant Katie Waissel has welcomed a move by the BBC and ITV to recruit more psychologists to support people who appear on TV. The broadcasters have joined forces to bring in the specialists to help fulfil their duty of care to contributors. Waissel said she had a ""horrifying"" experience during and after she appeared on The X Factor in 2010. ""This is a small victory that two huge companies have listened and are making significant changes moving forward."" Since appearing on the ITV talent show, Waissel has completed a law degree and set up a foundation to provide legal advice and mental health support for people in the entertainment industry. She is also trying to sue Simon Cowell's company Syco, claiming it did not uphold its duty of care when she was on the talent show. Syco has not commented on her legal claims. ""I can't let anybody else experience even a fraction of what I went through, not only during my time on that show, but post [it] as well,"" she said. ""Whether you're a participant or working on these shows, the hours are long, and there's an obscene amount of pressure all round. ""And with the ever-evolving conversations around mental health and mental health support, which has been phenomenal, that should be reflected in the work that people do."" ITV and the BBC have worked with the British Psychological Society, and are now appealing for registered psychologists who could become eligible to be involved with their programmes. The closing date for applications is this Friday. Simon Adair, the BBC's director of safety, security and resilience, said the ""health, safety and well-being of the contributors to our programmes is of the utmost importance"". He added: ""I'm confident this partnership will strengthen our whole industry by increasing the pool of expert psychologists available to us, ultimately enhancing our ability to protect and support those taking part in productions."" ITV's chief people officer, David Osborn, said: ""The demand for media psychologists is growing, so we've put together this development scheme to meet those production needs. ""Working together with the BBC is a big step for our industry, we're coming together to provide the best care for the people who help us make great television."" Waissel said she hopes moves like the BBC and ITV scheme would lead to ""a safer space for all to enjoy what should be enjoyed in your line of work, or your passions, or where your heart is"". She is also on a committee of people from the creative industry to set up an independent standards authority to guard against bullying, harassment, discrimination and misconduct.  The X Factor hit its ratings peak in 2010. The show is believed to have had independent psychologists to support contestants while they were on it and afterwards. Responding to Waissel's legal claim last month, Fremantle, which made the talent show, said the duty of care to contestants was ""of the utmost importance to us"". The company said it had ""robust measures in place to ensure contestants are supported, including a dedicated welfare team made up of psychologists, doctors, welfare producers and independent legal and management advisers with no time limit on aftercare once the show has aired"".

"Northumberland health and social care bodies ""failed"" man who died","A vulnerable man who died after discharging himself from hospital was let down by ""significant failings"" in his care, an investigation has found. The man, known as Mr B, suffered from heart issues and seizures and was found dead at his home in November 2019. The Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman criticised the way a number of bodies had supported him. It said his sister, Ms A, who brought a complaint, had faced ""considerable... uncertainty and distress"". The ombudsman criticised the ""combined faults"" of Northumberland County Council, the Cumbria, Northumberland and Tyne and Wear (CNTW) NHS Trust, and Coquet Medical Practice.  Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust was accused of failing to properly assess Mr B's mental capacity while he was an inpatient. The ombudsman's report said between 2017 and 2019 numerous services attempted to engage with Mr B, with limited success. In November 2019, he was taken to Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital in Cramlington where doctors concluded he had heart problems, flu and a respiratory tract infection. He discharged himself in the early hours against medical advice.  Mr B's GP and social worker persuaded him to return but his objection to having a cannula put in his arm raised concerns about his capacity to make decisions about his treatment. He left hospital again that night to go to his father's house, but was not there when an ambulance later arrived. Police found him at home the following morning, unwilling to return to hospital. Three days later he was found dead. Ms A complained Northumbria Healthcare Trust had ""inappropriately allowed Mr B to discharge himself from hospital"". The ombudsman could not say whether Mr B should have been kept in hospital, nor whether further inpatient treatment would have saved his life but said the uncertainty had caused ""distress and upset"" to Ms A, which was an ""injustice"". The trust was told to apologise to her and acknowledge its faults, and to offer a £300 ""symbolic payment"". It was also told to produce an plan to prevent similar failings. Northumberland County Council admitted it had made ""significant failings"" in not acting on referrals and not formally assessing Mr B's capacity to make decisions. The ombudsman said the authority's adult social care and safeguarding failings ""likely undermined"" Mr B's trust of professionals but it was not clear whether the outcome might have been different. The council told the Local Democracy Reporting Service it had ""identified a number of improvements to our services which have already been implemented"". Coquet Medical Practice acknowledged it did not recognise Mr B was vulnerable quickly enough and said it would make changes. CNTW accepted it failed to provide timely or adequate support and also said ""several improvements"" had been made.  Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Turkey-Syria earthquake: Baby among those still being rescued days later,,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64573926
The clues in the State of the Union that suggest Joe Biden will run for president in 2024,"President Joe Biden will probably announce in the next couple of months that he will run for a second presidential term in 2024. Were there clues in his State of the Union speech about his re-election campaign? The State of the Union address is an opportunity for the president to lay out his legislative programme for the coming year. In Mr Biden's speech on Tuesday, he also sounded as though he was making the case for his 2024 run, and made it clear he has no plan to cool down his political ambitions, despite lukewarm polling. As he rattled off his list of achievements and laid out his plans for the future, we got a preview of what his campaign platform could be. Mr Biden had more to boast about in 2022 than many would have predicted, after his difficult first year in the White House. Some of the achievements he is claiming are economic: more jobs created in two years than any other president has created in four years; unemployment at the lowest rate in half a century. Although the bounce back from the pandemic lay-offs began under his predecessor, Donald Trump.  He spoke of legislative successes, too. In his speech, he touted passing a huge infrastructure bill, that will help rebuild crumbling roads and bridges across America, by forging cross-party support. Then there were his climate measures that will encourage the production of clean energy, and tax breaks that will encourage the production of semiconductor chips in America, to reduce reliance on China.  Add to that the much better-than expected-results for Democrats in last year's midterm elections and you can see why Mr Biden feels he is a good position to win a second term. Most importantly, he doesn't have any serious challengers for the nomination. No other senior Democrats would dare put their names forward as potential candidates if the president says he is running again.  And yet there are also serious weaknesses too.   A recent ABC-Washington Post poll that asked voters about a possible Biden vs Trump rematch gave Trump a 48% to 45% advantage. That's within the margin of error but still concerning for Democrats.  ""Two years is forever and it's just one poll, but if he's faring this poorly after a string of wins, that should be worrisome,"" tweeted Julian Castro, a former Obama cabinet member. Other surveys suggest the prospect of a Biden candidacy does not excite voters.  An AP-NORC poll suggests that 62% of Democrats don't want him to run again. Many said they think he is too old and would prefer a younger candidate.  A CBS poll published on Tuesday showed that well over half of voters asked, said Biden's policies were making inflation, gas prices and the overall economy worse.  Of course, it is almost ridiculously early to be looking at polls and trying to work out what voters will be thinking 21 months from now.  What Team Biden are relying on is that by 2024, voters will be feeling the benefit of some of the legislation that Biden has already passed.  They hope his infrastructure spending will not only have repaired the fabric of the nation but will create even more jobs. They hope manufacturing industries will be seeing increased investment. And that inflation may have been tamed.  When confronted about the poor polling figures, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Democrats won in the midterm elections because of Mr Biden's successes. As they look to mount a 2024 campaign, his team needs to prepare themselves on questions about his age as well as his record. The Republican rebuttal on Tuesday night by a 40-year-old rising star Sarah Huckabee Sanders highlighted the generational difference and called on a new wave of young, conservative politicians to seize the moment. As the oldest US president in history, how Joe Biden appeared in his primetime speech mattered almost as much as what he had to say.  Everyone knows he would be 86 by the end of a second term. Even voters who support him frequently express doubts about his advancing years. This was a much more energetic performance than last year's address.  On Tuesday he enjoyed taunting his Republican opponents. Fluent and confident, he succeeded in sounding like he still has a real passion to ""finish the job"" - a line he repeated often.  Within hours of finishing his speech, Mr Biden headed to the key electoral state of Wisconsin to promote his infrastructure plan.  It's a presidential visit that may look a lot like a campaign stop.

NFT images of furry Birkin bags violated trademark rules,"An artist who made and sold digital images of Birkin handbags covered in fur violated trademark rights, a Manhattan court has concluded. The fashion giant Hermes, which owns the luxury brand, sued Mason Rothschild after he created non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, based on the famous bags. Hermes said consumers would believe the products were officially associated with the brand. The landmark case sets a precedent for other trials around NFTs. The jury awarded Hermes $133,000 (£110,000) in damages, rejecting Mr Rothschild's argument that his products, which he began selling in 2021, were works of art commenting on the market for luxury goods and should be protected by laws governing free speech.  A lawyer representing Mr Rothschild said it was a ""terrible day for artists and the First Amendment"".  There has been a flurry of interest in NFTs over the last few years. The digital tokens are unique products that are verified using blockchain technology. While most sell for around a hundred dollars, they can be worth millions. In the physical world a Birkin leather handbag also commands a high price - tens of thousands of dollars depending on the version. Mr Rothschild produced a series of images of the famous bag calling them ""MetaBirkins"". One was covered in shaggy green fur. There was a version based on Van Gogh's ""Starry Night"" painting, and an animation of a foetus growing inside a transparent Birkin handbag - a play on the brand's smaller model of its bag known as the ""baby Birkin"". The artist claimed his works were in the same vein as Andy Warhol's reproductions of Campbell soup cans. But the jury decided they should be seen as consumer products and were therefore covered by trademark law. Hermes said Mr Rothschild was a ""digital speculator"" who created his images of the bag as a ""get rich quick"" scheme. It said over $1m (£828,000) worth of MetaBirkins had been sold since December 2021. The fashion house said it had plans to issue NFTs itself, which were constrained by Mr Rothschild's actions. The court's decision will be closely watched by other brands seeking to clarify trademark rules around NFTs. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64573513
Edinburgh Playhouse staff scared over rising abuse - director,"Staff at the Edinburgh Playhouse are ""nervous and scared"" due to a rise in verbal and physical abuse from patrons, according to its theatre director. Colin Marr said the issue had become ""significantly worse"" since audiences returned after the Covid pandemic.  It comes after a 51-year-old man and a 54-year-old woman were charged over a disturbance during the musical Jersey Boys on 28 January. Mr Marr alleges a staff member was punched during the performance. Police Scotland said the two had been arrested and charged in connection with reports of a disturbance and a report would be submitted to the procurator fiscal. Another incident this week saw a member of staff member ""pushed and spat on"", according to Mr Marr. He said although such incidents only involve a minority in the 3,000-capacity venue, ""on a particular Friday or Saturday night, you might have to ask three or four groups to leave because of their behaviour"".   ""Sometime they react in a violent manner,"" he said. ""From talking to other theatres throughout the UK, it is happening at a huge number up and down the country."" Mr Marr said some patrons have shown disregard for whether their behaviour disturbs performances - something he said staff had not seen before. He said: ""If someone is either singing really loudly or maybe standing up and spoiling the enjoyment of others, we might get a complaint or we see it ourselves and ask them to change their behaviour. ""Nine times out of 10, the person is embarrassed but on a small number of occasions, they become aggressive, start shouting and swearing at our staff and it ends in violence. ""The reaction is 'I have paid for my ticket, I don't care if other people can't see or hear'."" Mr Marr added he was concerned about the impact on staff of dealing with aggressive audience members. ""It is not nice and you don't get used to it,"" he added. ""It is a cumulative thing.  ""If it's a one-off, you could brush it off but when you deal with two in a row, you can get down about it and then get a bit nervous and scared to come into work."" The King's Theatre in Glasgow issued a similar appeal on social media during the recent run of The Bodyguard featuring the songs of Whitney Houston, urging audiences not to sing along during shows.   It added that anti-social behaviour towards staff would not be tolerated. The same production begins a week-long run at the Edinburgh Playhouse later this month, when extra staff will be brought in. ""Most audience members are not even aware it is going on, they are having a wonderful time and have a great interaction with our staff,"" Mr Marr added. ""The vast majority want to hear the performer singing 'I Will Always Love You', not the person next to them. ""But that flashpoint can happen very quickly for a tiny majority."" Arts critic and former cinema manager Ian Hoey told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime with John Beattie that audience behaviour was a ""tricky"" balance for venues. ""People want to go out to have a good time and you don't like to put restrictions on anyone,"" he said. ""But you have got to consider other people next to you have also spent a lot of money and are looking forward to a night out."" Some shows, for example the Rocky Horror Picture Show, are designed to be ""rowdy"" and encourage audience interaction, he noted. ""In other ones, you can join in a bit but do you really have to shout and bawl and scream?"" he added. ""It's a living, shared experience but the cast will sense the discomfort of an audience, if for example a group of people surrounding them are getting too excited. ""It's going to be overwhelming and you're not going to enjoy the show. So it's entirely reasonable for theatres to say 'look, just consider other people'.""

Turkey-Syria earthquake: Devon Turkish group sends aid to region,"A man whose family was left homeless by an earthquake in Turkey has taken part in a drive to get donations to the devastated region.  Emir Erman is a member of the Devon Turkish Community centre in Exeter. The group has received ""hundreds"" of aid donations following the disaster that hit southern turkey and northern Syria, killing more than 11,000 people.  Mr Erman aid close relatives, including his father and sisters, had been left out in the cold.  ""They are living outside in a tent and it's freezing,"" he said. ""My sisters have little kids. I am away from them. I am feeling pain because I should be with them in this hard time. ""I'm heartbroken, upset, very sad, but at the same time I feel guilty because I'm not with my family. ""They are in a desperate condition. They are sleeping in chairs; they are putting the kids in the car.""

Yasar Oflaz, president of the Devon Turkish Community Centre, which is based in Pinhoe, said the disaster had prompted it to take action ""as soon as they heard"". The group has been collecting donations of money and clothing to be flown to Turkey from Heathrow. He said donations had flooded in from the community and further afield. ""The only way we can help is to send money and clothes so we are doing the best we can,"" he said. ""It's my home country and it feels so sad. It's scary."" Mr Oflaz said they were now struggling to get clothing to Turkey so asked that people stop donating these items.  Kate Jago, from the Pinhoe Village group, said the community had rallied around to help. ""It's heartbreaking and we can all relate to that,"" she said.

Turkey-Syria earthquake: Survivor in rubble sparks hope for more 'miracles',"Rescue workers called for silence at a fallen apartment building in the southern Turkish city of Iskenderun on Wednesday after hearing signs of life beneath the mounds of rubble. Onlookers including family, friends and neighbours of the building's residents stopped talking, while cranes and other machinery nearby were switched off. After minutes of silence, rescuers called out for an ambulance, confirming that a woman had been found alive.  The crowd broke into cheers and tears.  One woman, whose cousin and aunt lived in the building and are still missing, fell back onto a car bonnet and buried her face in her hands. Onlookers told the BBC it marked the first time a survivor had been found at the six-storey apartment block since Monday's earthquake reduced it to rubble. Shortly before they were found, a body had been pulled from the debris just a few metres away. Rescue workers and volunteers quickly formed a chain to carry the woman to a waiting ambulance. Local residents said she was a single mother in her 50s who lived alone in the building. Her son stood by the ambulance and watched as she was carried down, they added.  Several onlookers said it gave them renewed hope that their own missing loved ones would be found. One said she was hoping for a ""miracle"". Rescue workers hugged as the woman was taken away - a rare moment of hope and happiness among so much devastation. The mood at the Iskenderun apartment block quickly became sombre again as rescuers resumed the slow work of searching the rubble, largely by hand. Local doctor Mehmet Riyat told the BBC medical staff had been overwhelmed since Monday. ""We've had patients who have been crushed. We've seen lots of broken bones, broken necks, head injuries. And lots of deaths,"" he said. ""As doctors we have to do our jobs. But when the support teams take over, then we think about our own families."" There is destruction everywhere you turn in Iskenderun - many buildings have been destroyed, including a busy hospital. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hit back on Wednesday at mounting anger over the state's response to the disaster. Critics have said emergency efforts have been too slow and that not enough was done to prepare the earthquake-prone region by his government. But Mr Erdogan said: ""It's not possible to be prepared for a disaster this big."" The 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck early on Monday morning near the southern city of Gaziantep, which is close to the Syrian border. The death toll currently stands at more than 11,000 people across both countries. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64570463

Turkey earthquake: Hope as foreign help arrives in quake-ravaged Antakya,"Antakya felt forsaken. People here had been complaining for days - pleading, in fact, for more help in finding the thousands missing and trapped in the collapsed buildings throughout their city.  Help from the Turkish government was slow to come, and they wondered: where was all the international aid? By late in the third day of aftermath, things had changed. Roads in and out of the southern Turkish city were gridlocked with heavy equipment, ambulances and pickup trucks bringing help - albeit at a snail's pace - to those who had long lost the luxury of patience.  Volunteers who dug for their relatives by hand were now joined by the professionals. ""Can you please stand back,"" an English voice commanded from one roadside ruin halfway down Ataturk Street. The Brits had arrived.  Some 77 men and women from the UK International Search and Rescue got here on Wednesday afternoon. Firefighters, medics and a sniffer dog named Dave. Phil Irving is usually in charge of a fire station in west Wales. He's responsible for the team's safety and was frankly a little surprised to find himself so close to the border with Syria. But he's a veteran of disasters and has been with the International Search and Rescue for 17 years.  ""I went to Haiti in 2010 and this is comparable to the devastation I've witnessed, particularly in this location where it doesn't seem to be that international teams have arrived."" They were only supposed to be surveying buildings, not carrying out rescues yet, when word came - or perhaps Dave the sniffer dog's nose twitched (no one was really very clear) - of a sixty-year-old woman trapped under four floors of apartment block. A London firefighter, Sarah Minash, spoke to the woman as the rest of the team chipped and hacked at the collapsed building around her - creating a tunnel to bring her out.  ""She smiled at us when she saw us,"" Sarah said. ""It's my first foreign deployment,"" she added, looking really pleased.  ""We're extremely pleased, really emotional when things go well,"" said Jim Chasten, team leader from the Kent Fire and Rescue Service. ""[It's] a really good outcome. I've already lost track of time, but it's still light, so we couldn't have been here that long."" In fact, they'd only been on the ground for five hours. The rescued woman's name is Salva. She's sixty-years-old and survived three-and-a-half days without food or water. She cried in pain as she was brought out while her son-in-law, Ali Ekenel, cried tears of joy.  ""She's the most important person in the world to my wife,"" he said.  The men and women from UK International Service and Rescue took a round of applause from the waiting crowd and moved on, looking for more survivors.

"Chinese balloon part of worldwide fleet, US officials say","The US believes a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that was shot down over its territory is part of a wider fleet that has spanned five continents. ""The United States was not the only target of this broader programme,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. He added that the US had shared information gathered from the balloon debris with dozens of other countries. China has denied the balloon was being used for spying purposes, and says it was a weather device blown astray. US officials have described the balloon as being about 200 ft (60m) tall, with the payload portion comparable in size to regional airliners and weighing hundreds - or potentially thousands - of pounds. It was shot down by a fighter jet over the South Carolina coast on Saturday, a move that set off a diplomatic crisis and prompted Secretary Blinken to immediately call off a trip to China - the first such high level US-China meeting there in years. Citing unnamed officials, the Washington Post reported that the US believes the suspected surveillance balloon project was being operated from China's coastal Hainan province and targeted countries including Japan, India, Vietnam, Taiwan and the Philippines.  At a Wednesday news conference, Defence Department spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder confirmed that the US believed similar balloons had operated over North and South America, South-East Asia, East Asia and Europe.  ""We've learned a lot about these balloons and how to track them,"" Gen Ryder said, adding that the US was now confident it had the ability to be ""on the look-out for these kinds of capabilities"".  He said while the objects were all used for surveillance missions, there were ""variations"" in terms of their size and capabilities.  The US believes that balloons have operated over US territory on at least four occasions, but Gen Ryder did not give further detail on these instances. Washington briefed 40 allied countries about the alleged espionage programme earlier this week, a senior Biden administration confirmed to CBS News, the BBC's US partner.  Naval and Coast Guard ships and divers are still searching for debris from the balloon. It is unclear what intelligence the US has so far gleaned from the remnants, although experts say that the debris could help officials better understand what the balloon was capable of and how it transmitted information.

Google's AI bot mistake wipes $100bn off shares,"Google is searching for ways to reassure people that it is still out in front in the race for the best artificial intelligence technology. And so far, the internet giant seems to be coming up with the wrong answer. An advert designed to show off its new AI-bot, showed it answering a query incorrectly. Shares in parent company Alphabet sank more than 7% on Wednesday, knocking $100bn (£82bn) off the firm's market value.  In the promotion for the bot, known as Bard, which was released on Twitter on Monday, the bot was asked about what to tell a nine-year-old about discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope. It offered the response that the telescope was the first to take pictures of a planet outside the earth's solar system, when in fact that milestone was claimed by the European Very Large Telescope in 2004 - a mistake quickly noted by astronomers on Twitter. ""Why didn't you factcheck this example before sharing it?"" Chris Harrison, a fellow at Newcastle University, replied to the tweet.  Investors were also underwhelmed by a presentation the company gave about its plans to deploy artificial intelligence in its products. Google has been under pressure since late last year, when Microsoft-backed OpenAI unveiled new ChatGPT software. It quickly became a viral hit for its facility in passing business school exams, composing song lyrics and answering other questions.  Microsoft this week said a new version of its Bing search engine, which has lagged Google for years, would use the ChatGPT technology in an even more advanced form.  Though investors have embraced the push for artificial intelligence, sceptics have warned rushing out the technology raises risks of errors or otherwise skewed results, as well as issues of plagiarism. A Google spokesperson said the error highlighted ""the importance of a rigorous testing process, something that we're kicking off this week with our Trusted Tester programme"". ""We'll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard's responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and roundedness in real-world information,"" they said.

Turkey quake: President Erdogan accepts some problems with response,"Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has defended his government's response to two catastrophic earthquakes, saying it was impossible to prepare for the scale of the disaster. At least 12,000 people are confirmed dead in Turkey and northern Syria. Critics claimed the emergency services' response was too slow and the government was poorly prepared. Mr Erdogan accepted the government had encountered some problems, but said the situation was now ""under control"".  The leader of Turkey's main opposition party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu disagreed. ""If there is one person responsible for this, it is Erdogan,"" he said. The president rejected the accusation and said unity was required in the aftermath of the disaster, ""In a period like this, I cannot stomach people conducting negative campaigns for political interest,"" he told reporters in Hatay. In nearby Syria, relief efforts have been complicated by years of conflict that has destroyed the nation's infrastructure. The Bab al-Hawa crossing between Turkey and Syria has been closed since the earthquake as the roads were badly damaged. While a senior UN official said the road may soon be accessible, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the country was working to open two more border gates to help get aid into the country. ""There are some difficulties in terms of Turkey's and the international community's aid [reaching Syria]. For this reason, efforts are being made to open two more border gates,"" he said. More than 1,500 people have died in Idlib province alone and an adviser to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said sanctions were stopping Syria from receiving the aid it needed. ""We don't have enough bulldozers, we do not have enough cranes, we do not have enough oil due to European and American sanctions,"" Bouthaina Shabban said.  The EU has confirmed it will send €3.5m (£3.1m) in aid to Syria following a government request for assistance, but said the aid must be delivered to both government- and rebel-controlled areas. Many Syrians have fled the civil war to Turkey. Reuters news agency spoke to one man, named Abdulalim, who fled Syria to Turkey to escape the civil war. Abdulalim survived the quake after rescuers pulled him out from beneath the rubble, but his wife and two daughters did not.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64577371
The tricky decisions facing cash-strapped councils,"Scotland's councils are facing a £700m funding gap as they prepare to set their budgets for the coming year.  Individual local authorities have shortfalls ranging from around £7m in the Scottish Borders to £120m at Glasgow City Council, according to research by the BBC.  Councils have been appealing to the Scottish government for more cash but ministers have said they have been given a fair settlement in challenging circumstances.  Without additional national funding, councils are considering major cuts to local jobs and services and increases in council tax to balance their books.  The BBC asked all 32 local authorities for more details of the options under consideration. All but Angus and Dumfries & Galloway replied.  Councils are large employers and cutting staff numbers - or ""headcount"" in the jargon - could significantly reduce costs.  Western Isles council - Comhairle Nan Eilean Siar - may not replace the only traffic warden on the islands who retired last year.  While that may not be the most unpopular job cut, according to a leaked document from the council body, Cosla, it could be one of more than 7,000 in the next three years.  That figure included the anticipated loss of around 1,750 teachers with proposals for extensive job cuts in Glasgow making headlines.  The Scottish government has now stepped in to stop cuts to teaching posts.  The SNP has a manifesto to increase teacher numbers and big cuts to the workforce could worsen relations with unions whose members are already striking over pay.  In a letter to council leaders, seen by the BBC, the education secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville has made clear she will clawback cash from local authorities that don't maintain teacher and pupil support staff numbers at current levels.  Cosla's leadership has said this ""means significant cuts will have to be made in other areas that support children, young people, families and our communities"".  Midlothian council is considering the closure of St Matthew's RC primary school in Rosewell and potential cuts to music tuition.  Caroline Haddock, who has two children at the school, said she was ""absolutely devastated"" at the possibility it could shut, arguing that it does not make sense because new housing is to be developed in the village.  ""We've got capacity, we've got room - where are they going to put the children?"" she said. The council has stressed that no final decision has been taken.  In Clackmannanshire, councillors are considering reducing home to school transport and the amount of money spent on the delivery of less popular secondary school subjects.  Beyond education, leisure services face cuts in many areas with Inverclyde council looking at the closure of Greenock sports centre and Port Glasgow swimming pool.  Local swimmer, Gary Anderson said he would be ""very upset"" if the Port Glasgow facility shut and another pool user, Pamela Atkinson said it helped keep her fit and healthy.  Inverclyde Council is still considering a range of cost-saving options.  The library in West Calder is one of several that could be shut under savings plans being considered by West Lothian council.  In West Dunbartonshire, the council is thinking about reducing the opening hours of its recycling centres.  Many charities are worried about the loss of grant funding from local authorities with concerns being raised from Argyll and Bute to North Lanarkshire and Edinburgh.  Introducing or increasing charges for some services can help boost council funds.  Aberdeen City Council is putting up most parking charges, while West Dunbartonshire thinks it could generate an extra £325,000 through parking enforcement.  In East Ayrshire, they are looking at a 4% increase in the rent charged for temporary accommodation.  Moray Council is proposing a 10% increase in the cost of burying the dead, with charges for the interment of local adults to rise from £949 to £1,044.  In East Renfrewshire, there is already a £40 charge, on top of council tax, for households that want garden waste removed. This could go up to £60.  Council tax only generates about 13% of local government funding. Most of their cash comes from the Scottish government.  That means small council tax increases don't generate huge amounts of extra money compared to what councils say they need.  Big increases are unlikely to be considered widely acceptable when many households are already struggling with cost of living pressures.  Aberdeenshire council is due to set its local tax rates at a meeting on Thursday, with councillors being asked to consider the impact of rises of 3-10%.  A 3% hike would increase the amount paid by those in average Band D properties by £40 a year, while a 10% rise would cost an additional £134.  More typically, councils seem to be looking at increases of 3-5%.  In future, councils may have broader tax powers at their disposal including a local visitor levy, which is sometimes dubbed the ""tourist tax"".  Selling off buildings and other things councils own and consider they no longer need is another way they can raise money.  East Renfrewshire Council has decided to sell its distinctive civic number plate HS 0 to the highest bidder, with experts estimating it could be worth £150-250,000.  Falkirk Council has agreed in principle to offload up to 133 properties that it describes as ageing and in need of repair.  It is willing to transfer these buildings to community organisations, rather than sell them, to save on maintenance costs.  Where asset transfers are not possible these buildings could be closed over the next few years.  The list includes Polmonthill ski centre, Stenhousemuir gym and Bo'ness recreation centre.  There's particular concern about the future of Grangemouth stadium which describes itself as ""one of the premier training facilities in Scotland"".  The athlete Eilish McColgan, who first ran for Scotland at the venue, has said: ""It must be saved because it is so important for track and field in Scotland.""  Falkirk Council have carried out a consultation on their proposals to inform their decision making.  There are some other options available to councils.  Some may choose to draw on their financial reserves - money typically kept aside for emergencies and other unforeseen challenges.  Others are planning to spread the cost of paying back PPP/PFI debts, for things like school buildings, over a longer period of time.  South Ayrshire started ""reprofiling"" its debts in December 2022, Fife is looking to do the same and East Dunbartonshire said it was continuing to ""explore financial flexibilities"".  Councils have faced a long term squeeze on their finances and argue that they are underfunded by the Scottish government.  Ministers accept that councils are under pressure but point out that they are receiving a cash uplift of more than half a billion pounds in 2023/24.  Cosla says most of that cash is ring-fenced for particular national priorities and gives councils little flexibility.  Independent analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies has found that when new and expanding responsibilities are taken into account ""grant funding for Scottish councils is set to fall by 0.8% in real terms this April"".  ""Even if Scottish councils were to increase their council tax rates by 5% in April, their overall funding would still fall by about 0.3% in real terms,"" the institute said.  All Scotland's councils are obliged to set their budgets for 2023/24 in the coming weeks with many of them making their decisions on either 23 February or 1 March.

Cost of living: Calls to boost students' £30 EMA grant,"Young people could be priced out of education because financial help has been frozen for nearly 20 years, it has been claimed. Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) is available to 16 to 18-year-olds living in Wales who remain in further education after school-leaving age.  Keira said her £30 EMA was the same her 31-year-old brother was entitled to when he was in school in 2004. The Welsh government said it offered learners a range of funding support.  A Plaid Cymru Member of the Senedd wants the weekly £30 grant increased to £55 due to the rising cost of living.  Students qualify for EMA if their household annual income is below £23,077, or £20,817 if there is only one young person in their household.  Keira, 16, an art student from Bethesda, Gwynedd, is one of 60,000 college and sixth form students in Wales who qualify. But she said the money did not always cover her bus travel and art supplies. ""He got on OK because prices weren't the same then, [but] now prices are so expensive. You'll be using big chunks of your money just to get places,"" she said.  ""It's really hard to keep to that budget."" Rosie,17 and Carys, 16, are studying childcare in college in south Wales and both use the allowance to pay for their phone bills, transport and essentials. ""If I didn't have EMA I don't know what I'd do. I'd probably rely on family and feel terrible about it as they pay heavy bills,"" Rosie said. ""I feel like when it was 2004, living costs weren't as high as they are now, [so] we could use a bit of a raise to help."" Carys said: ""Not everybody is made of money, not everybody has got money. I think it [the increase] would help everyone as costs are going up and they can be more independent."" Plaid Cymru MS for South Wales West, Luke Fletcher, said he was supported by EMA when he was at school and wants it increased by £25, in line with inflation. He said: ""EMA is a very important tool for us here in Wales to make sure that kids from low income households are able to stay in education. ""The payment has stayed at £30 since 2004... [and] when we look at inflation it needs to be a lot higher than it is now. It's simply at the moment not doing the job that it was designed to do."" The issue was also raised in the Senedd on Tuesday by Swansea East MS Mike Hedges, who called for the Welsh government to raise the allowance. The Welsh government said: ""Unlike in England, where it was scrapped, Wales has continued to protect the EMA programme. ""Alongside the payment we provide support for transport costs, and the Financial Contingency Fund, which can help eligible learners in a further education college in Wales who are facing financial difficulties."" It also urged students to ask their colleges about what support is available.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64569170
"Nigeria election 2023 in Katsina: 'You let kidnappers take me, now you want my vote'","Many Nigerians live in constant fear of being kidnapped and held for ransom by armed gangs, especially in the north-west of the country, where thousands of people have had to flee their homes. The insecurity means many in the region, which has the country's largest number of registered voters, may not take part in the 25 February elections. An unpaved mile-long road that ends at a tree stump is the only way for vehicles to get into Bakiyawwa village in Nigeria's northern Katsina state.  This community of mostly subsistence farmers is not where you would expect criminals behind Nigeria's lucrative kidnap-for-ransom business to go looking for victims.  It came as a surprise therefore when motorcycle-riding armed men invaded last September and abducted 57 villagers. ""They held my wife for 38 days,"" said Abduljabara Mohammed, a civil servant and one of those considered well-off. He paid 1m naira ($2,100; £1,700) for her release. ""I gave them all my money and a motorcycle, then pleaded with them not to take me,"" said Zaradeen Musa, 30, whose door was kicked in around 01:00 as the armed men, commonly referred to as bandits, operated unchallenged for four hours after repelling a police unit called in by the villagers. Maria Sani, 45, was seized but managed to slip away as the bandits led the victims to their forest hideout.  She was left wondering what would have become of her if she had not escaped as, like many abducted that day, she could never have afforded the ransom. All those kidnapped were eventually freed but only after months of negotiations that resulted in them paying with cash or valuables such as motorcycles. The abductions show how far the kidnapping problem has spread - not even the poorest are spared. Nevertheless, those in Bakiyawwa would consider themselves lucky as the attacks sometimes turn deadly, such as the reported killing of more than 100 villagers by armed men last Friday in another part of Katsina. Such armed groups in the north-west and violent secessionists in the south-east pose real threats to the 25 February elections, analysts say. Attacks on offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) led to polls being moved by a week in 2019, and the recent burning of an Inec office in the south-east has led to fears of another postponement, although officials have said there will be no delays.  In December, Inec announced that it was too dangerous to hold the polls in some parts of Katsina state but it is not clear what will happen on election day. Law professor Chidi Odinkalu argues that this election risks being dragged into unchartered legal territory if insecurity hampers voting and a candidate believes they have been robbed of vital support. In the past, people have stayed away from voting over fears of violence in southern states like Imo, Anambra, Lagos and Rivers, but now, the kidnap crisis in the north has left many disinterested in the elections. ""You let kidnappers take me, now you want my vote,"" said Mrs Sani through an interpreter.  Like many here she previously voted for President Muhammadu Buhari but she is sitting this one out. President Buhari is standing down after serving two terms and Bola Tinubu is standing for the governing All Progressives Congress (APC). ""How can you see all the suffering and still vote for the APC?"" said Lawal Suleiman, a former party member but now a lone voice in the village campaigning for the Labour Party's Peter Obi.  Many others in Bakiyawwa say they would probably back the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), if they vote at all. ""If Buhari couldn't solve the problems of this country, no-one else can,"" Nana Samaila, who fled her village in Batsari three years ago after attacks by armed groups, told the BBC. Her daughter, Aisha Mama, also recently fled with her husband from the village of Dangyya after persistent night-time attacks forced her family to sleep in their farm for weeks.    Mrs Samaila had high hopes that President Buhari, a former military ruler who comes from Katsina, would solve Nigeria's myriad issues when she first voted for him in 2003, but like many others, she is now disillusioned by the failures of his government. Hundreds of school children have been abducted and released, and the state governor once asked residents to arm themselves against the bandits in a show of helplessness. The leading candidates in the election recognise that insecurity, which is intertwined with rising food prices that have caused record levels of inflation, is Nigeria's biggest challenge at the moment. Atiku Abubakar of the PDP, Mr Tinubu of the APC and Mr Obi of the Labour Party are proposing police reforms, revamping the military and improved welfare, among other ideas. Their plans are not radically different from what President Buhari, who was elected on a promise of tackling Islamist groups in the north-east, has done with only limited little success. While he has largely succeeded in containing the Islamist insurgency, violence in the north-west and south-east has massively increased on his watch. ""He scattered [destroyed] the economy, there is so much insecurity,"" said Mohammed Yusuf, a farmer originally from Katsina now forced into selling tea and cooked noodles on the streets of the region's biggest city, Kano. Kano, Katsina and Kaduna, dubbed the three Ks, are considered key states for whoever wants to emerge as Nigeria's president because of their large voting population. There are more registered voters here than in the five south-eastern states. Mr Buhari's bloc of votes in the trio of states helped him win two elections in a row, and while some will still back the APC, there is a feeling that the party has lost ground in a region battered by insecurity. Just two weeks ago, this was illustrated when stones were thrown at the president's helicopter during a visit to Kano.  There is also a dark horse in the form of Rabiu Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). Only his die-hard supporters expect him to win the presidency, but he has emerged as a major disruptor who might decide who becomes the next president.  A former governor of Kano state and one-time defence minister, Mr Kwankwaso is immensely popular in Kano and neighbouring Jigawa state. If he takes the majority of votes in Kano, whose six million registered voters rank second only to Lagos, it will greatly affect other candidates, especially those of the APC and PDP. This might work in favour of the Labour Party which does not have a strong support base in the region. Mr Kwankwaso, like many other Nigerian politicians, has switched parties several times. Last time, he backed the PDP and there are rumours he will step down for its candidate and fellow northerner, Mr Abubakar, at some point. ""He and Obi won't win, though they are better alternatives to Mr Abubakar who is a crony capitalist,"" said Umar Yahaya, a university student driving a taxi in nearby Kaduna. ""But anyone that votes the APC is rewarding them for failure,"" he said, as we headed to the recently reopened Rigasa station to board the Kaduna-Abuja train. The line had been shut for months after a deadly attack by militants which saw the killing and abduction of dozens of passengers. When Mr Buhari inaugurated the line in 2016 it was considered a sign of progress in the north, but now it has become a symbol of the violence consuming the region.

Ramcharitmanas: The Hindu epic poem causing a political storm in India,"A 16th-Century epic poem based on the life of popular Hindu god Ram is at the centre of a huge political row in India. Ramcharitmanas is counted by many scholars to be among the world's greatest literary creations. Celebrated author Pavan Varma calls it ""a deeply philosophical work"" which ""is akin to the Bible for many Hindus"".  Composed by Tulsidas, the poem is a retelling of Ramayana, the Sanskrit epic written by Hindu sage Valmiki 2,500 years ago. It's widely believed that Tulsidas's version, which is written in Awadhi - a dialect very similar to Hindi - is what made Ram's story accessible to the masses and why it became so popular. The story of the crown prince of Ayodhya and his victory over the demon king Ravana is performed every year during the Dussehra festival across India. He is a god who's revered by millions of Hindus for his sense of justice and fair play. But in the past few weeks, politicians on opposing sides have been arguing over whether the text is derogatory towards women as well as Dalits, who are at the bottom of India's deeply discriminatory caste system. This is not the first time Tulsidas's epic, written more than 600 years ago, has been criticised, but what sets it apart this time is the scale of protests by both its supporters and critics. General elections in India are due in a year and politicians from both sides accuse each other of using the controversy over the book to polarise voters along caste lines.  Since January, protesters have burned pages allegedly containing excerpts from the book - and counter-protests have been held, demanding critics of the work be arrested. At least five people, accused of desecrating the sacred text, have been arrested and, at the weekend, police invoked the National Security Act (NSA), a draconian law that makes bail nearly impossible, against two of the arrested men. Trouble started in January when a minister in the northern state of Bihar said the book was ""spreading hatred in society"". At a gathering of university students, Education Minister Chandrashekhar (who uses only one name) recited a few lines from Ramcharitmanas to prove his point. ""It says that if people from lower castes receive education, they become poisonous, like a snake becomes after drinking milk,"" he said. A few days later, Swami Prasad Maurya, a prominent leader of a socially-disadvantaged community known as Other Backward Classes (OBC) and a member of the regional Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh state, expressed similar sentiments.  Insisting that some verses of Ramcharitmanas were ""offensive"", he demanded that they be removed from the book.  ""Why hurl abuse in the name of religion? I respect all religions. But if in the name of religion, a community or caste is humiliated then it is objectionable,"" The Indian Express quoted him as saying. On Wednesday, he tweeted a letter he's written to the prime minister and the president of India, asking them to ""remove the objectionable comments, which are abusive and insulting towards women, tribals, Dalits and backwards"". The comments by Mr Chandrasekhar, whose Rashtriya Janata Dal party governs Bihar, and Mr Maurya set off a political firestorm with Hindu nationalist groups, including members from India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) criticising them.  BJP politician Nandkishore Gurjar said he had written to the Supreme Court demanding the death penalty for Mr Maurya. In the temple town of Ayodhya a prominent Hindu seer demanded the Bihar minister apologise and be sacked.  In Uttar Pradesh, protesters burnt effigies of Mr Maurya and lodged a police complaint, demanding his arrest. Soon, groups supporting Mr Maurya also joined in. At a protest by members of the Akhil Bharatiya OBC Mahasabha in his support in the city of Lucknow, some pages containing excerpts from Ramcharitmanas were burned - the five men who were arrested had participated in this protest. The controversy has also renewed a debate around Ramcharitmanas and whether the criticism has any merit in a country where the constitution sets out that all Indians are equal. Feminists have decried it over the years, especially lines that say that ""a drum, an uneducated man, a Dalit and a woman, all need to be beaten or reprimanded"".  Prof Hemlata Mahishwar of Delhi's Jamia University told BBC Hindi that ""it's not just one or two lines but there are several verses"" in Ramcharitmanas that are derogatory to women and Dalits. ""There's one couplet that says that a Brahmin is to be worshipped even if he's full of bad qualities. Whereas a Dalit, even if he's a Vedic scholar, cannot be respected. So how can we accept a book that's so biased?""  Some experts, however, say that Tulsidas was not a reformer and did have his biases, but the controversial lines are spoken by his characters and can't be taken to be a reflection of the author's opinion. Akhilesh Shandilya, an expert on Ramcharitmanas, told BBC Hindi that the lines appear derogatory to Dalits and anti-women only when taken out of context and read in isolation.  But critics say that Ramcharitmanas has to be approached in the present-day context and deserves scrutiny and discussion, especially as it is a book that has such a hold on the imagination of Indians.

Turkey and Syria earthquake: ‘The worst thing is to be a doctor in these circumstances’,"""The look in this child's eyes really got to me,"" says Dr Ahmed al-Masri. ""I don't know why but as soon as he looked at me, I started crying."" It was more than 30 hours after Monday's devastating earthquake and he was exhausted. He and just one other doctor were treating scores of injured people being brought to their hospital in Afrin, a town in opposition-held north-western Syria. Then, seven-year-old Mohammed arrived, having been dug out from beneath the rubble of his collapsed home. Rescuers found him lying beside the body of his father, who had been crushed to death along with his mother and his siblings. ""The way the boy was looking at us, I felt like he trusted us, he knew that he was in safe hands now,"" Dr Masri tells me in a Zoom call. ""But I also felt he had a lot of strength, like he was holding in the pain of his injuries. What makes a seven-year-old child so strong and resilient?"" Dr Masri is a resident surgeon at Al-Shifa Hospital, which is supported by the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), a charity. He says it received more than 200 patients in the immediate aftermath of the disaster.  Another young survivor brought in by rescuers was an 18-month-old boy. Dr Masri checked him over and established that he was fine. But he then realised that the boy's parents were not with him. ""Suddenly, I saw his father run to him and hold him, sobbing and crying,"" he says. ""The father told me this child was the only survivor in his family. The rest of the family was laid out in the corridor, dead."" Dr Masri says staff at the hospital were stunned at the scale of the catastrophe, with ""waves"" of patients arriving all at once. ""I never imagined that an earthquake could create this much damage, could lead to this number of patients.""  Sadly, he is used to dealing with major incidents. In 2013, he was working in a field hospital when rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were fired at several opposition-held suburbs of the capital, Damascus. Hundreds of people were killed and thousands of others were injured. ""At that time, we were trained and prepared, as doctors for such an event,"" Dr Masri says. ""We were able to organise ourselves quickly. But in this scenario we weren't prepared. This situation was far worse."" Following Monday's earthquake, he and his colleagues in Afrin dealt with patients who looked lightly injured at first. ""They were injuries that you think are not serious, but someone then needs to have a limb amputated,"" he says. ""We don't have the capacity in our hospitals to respond to this kind of disaster."" ""The worst thing is to be a doctor in these circumstances. When you are unable to save a patient or ease someone's pain - that's the worst thing you can feel."" As he treated patients, Dr Masri also had to deal with not knowing whether his own family was safe because the electricity supply and the internet were both down. His parents and siblings live just a few hundred metres away from the hospital, but his wife and children live across the border in the southern Turkish city of Gaziantep, which was close to the epicentre and was also badly affected.  ""The worst feeling you can have during such crises is not knowing whether your family and loved ones are OK."" ""We were looking at patients with two eyes - one to assess their injuries, and the other to see whether the patient is a family member or not."" A sigh of relief came when his brother rushed to the hospital to assure Dr Masri that his whole family was safe. He also managed to have a brief rest at the hospital. ""When I slept at that point, I just collapsed,"" he says. ""There were moments where I needed someone to hold me up so I could keep working."" Dr Masri then managed to leave work and have breakfast with his family. He hopes he can eventually travel to see his wife and children in Gaziantep.  He says he also went to check on Mohammed the next day and asked the seven-year-old if he recognised him. ""Yes, you're the doctor who saved my life,"" Mohammed replied.

Droughts leave cargo riverboats high and dry,"Increased droughts are forcing shipping companies to abandon some of the world's main river cargo routes, warns Ann Christina Sloek-Andersen. Ms Sloek-Andersen is a senior director at global shipping giant Maersk. ""[Last summer] we had to switch a lot of cargo from river to rail in Europe,"" she says, ""in order to keep the big German industry clusters in Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria and Hessen connected to the ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp."" More than 300 million tonnes of goods a year are typically transported by cargo riverboats on the wide Rhine River, which flows for almost 800 miles from Switzerland to the Netherlands, where it joins the North Sea. Yet during the summer months of last year, record low water levels meant some vessels were able to carry just 25% of their usual load, so as not to risk running aground on the riverbed. This caused severe delays to shipping. ""There are lots of well-known German and Swiss blue-chip companies... that rely on inland waterways to get raw materials and products in and out,"" says Ms Sloek-Andersen. The cargo Maersk's riverboats carry ranges from temperature-sensitive fresh produce and pharmaceuticals, to raw materials like chemicals, and car and machinery parts. ""We carry our customers' cargo on barges wherever possible,"" says Ms Sloek-Andersen, ""because it means far less CO2 emissions compared to trucks."" However, when the Rhine's levels fell last summer, Maersk says its existing partnerships with rail providers meant they were able to ""jump in with extra capacity"". Rail, says Ms Sloek-Andersen, is the preferred alternative to river as they have a similarly low CO2 footprint, at around 20-30g of CO2 per tonne-km per year (gCO2e/tkm), as opposed to trucks that emit almost 140 gCO2e/tkm.  However, she adds that other companies had to switch to road freight. And it wasn't just Europe that found itself high and dry last year. ""You could walk across the mighty Mississippi River - that's not something we were prepared for,"" says Sarah Schiffling, lecturer in supply chain management at Liverpool Business School. The Mississippi River is used to transport more than 500 million tonnes of freight a year, but last year record low water levels were estimated to have cost $20bn (£16.7bn) in economic damage. ""Droughts are not a new phenomenon,"" says Ms Schiffling, ""but [last year] we saw droughts in multiple areas across the world, all at the same time. It had a massive impact on inland shipping."" In China, parts of the Yangtze River, whose surrounding provinces produce 45% of the country's economic output, were closed to ships because water levels were more than 50% below average. Meanwhile, two-thirds of Europe experienced drought conditions in 2022, as the continent saw its worst dry spell in at least 500 years. It comes as studies show that drought conditions are only expected to worsen in the years ahead. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade. So what can be done to help river barges stay afloat? In Germany, one proposed solution is to deepen a shallow section of the Rhine. This would enable cargo riverboats to carry at least an extra 200 tonnes, according to Germany's Waterways and Shipping Office. But plans to deepen a 31-mile section of the World Heritage-listed Middle Rhine - where the river is lined with castles and vineyards - are controversial. ""Deepening and widening the area will have knock-on effects on the environment - flooding and destroying ecosystems,"" says Ms Schiffling. ""And, of course, it doesn't solve the core problem. No matter how deep you make it, there's just not enough water."" Rather than swapping to land transport, one manufacturer of cargo riverboats, Germany's HGK, is now producing vessels that can continue to sail in very shallow waters. ""Our shallow-water tanker, Synthese 18, can transport cargo weighing 300 tonnes - even if the water is only 1.05 metres deep,"" says Anke Bestmann, HGK's shipping business unit leader. The boat has a very short vertical distance between the waterline and the bottom of its hull, a measurement known as a ""draft"". To compensate for this lack of depth, the vessel is wider than older barge designs. It is also made from a lighter-weight stainless steel, and the riverboat's design is said to allow for great uplift as it moves along the water. Fellow HGK director Tim Godde adds that the firm is ""convinced that inland waterway vessels will transport even more goods in future"". However, Maersk's Ms Sloek-Andersen says that the ability for a transportation firm to adapt, and switch from river to rail, and so on, is key.  ""Having a single provider for all parts of a supply chain makes it much easier and quicker to react and mitigate negative impact if disruption occurs - like a low-water period on one of the main inland waterways of Europe,"" she says.

Twitter outage sees users told they are over daily tweet limit,"Some Twitter users were unable to tweet on Wednesday after the website experienced technical problems. Account holders received a message saying: ""You are over the daily limit for sending Tweets.""  The outage-tracking website DownDetector reported the glitch at just before 22:00 GMT. Elon Musk has slashed Twitter's workforce over the last few months since he acquired the platform last October for $44bn (£36.5bn). Last month the Tesla and SpaceX boss said Twitter had about 2,300 employees - down from around 8,000 when he took over.  For months experts have been warning that such deep cuts could cause technical issues, though it is not yet clear if the reduced headcount was to blame for Wednesday's outage.  It appears part of the outage was soon fixed, with many users reporting they could tweet.   Some reported being notified by Twitter that they were over the 2,400-tweet-per-day limit, even if they had not posted on Wednesday. Account holders had also reported problems with Twitter messages. Several users said they could not access TweetDeck - a dashboard that can be used with Twitter.  It's not yet clear how many people were affected.  ""Twitter may not be working as expected for some of you. Sorry for the trouble. We're aware and working to get this fixed,"" Twitter said.  In recent weeks many users have complained of bugs while using Twitter - including some claiming they could increase the reach of tweets if they locked their accounts.  Tech news website The Information reported that Mr Musk had told Twitter employees to pause on new feature development ""in favour of maximising system stability and robustness, especially with the Super Bowl coming up"".

Rihanna: Super Bowl half-time show to mark singer's live return,"Rihanna fans are eagerly anticipating her performance at the Super Bowl half-time show - one of the biggest and most prestigious gigs in music. The singer will perform during the break when the Philadelphia Eagles take on the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday. Rihanna has not toured or released an album since 2016's Anti. The star has instead focused on her fashion brand, and last year welcomed her first child. However, she did record a new song last year for Marvel's Wakanda Forever. Lift Me Up, which features on the soundtrack to the Black Panther sequel, marked Rihanna's first new solo single for six years and has been nominated for an Oscar. Fans hope that the 34-year-old's Super Bowl performance could signal a bigger musical comeback later this year. The Super Bowl is the annual final playoff game of the National Football League (NFL), to determine the league champion. This year, the Philadelphia Eagles will face the Kansas City Chiefs at the State Farm Stadium in Arizona. The Super Bowl LVII (the Roman numerals signify this is the 57th year) will take place on Sunday 12 February, with kick-off at 23:30 GMT (18:30 ET / 16:30 MST). The game usually lasts about three-and-a-half hours, with a 30-minute break in the middle, which is where an A-list pop star is hired to keep the crowds entertained. UK viewers can watch the game and half-time show live on ITV1 and the recently-launched streaming service ITVX, with coverage beginning at 22:45 GMT. It is also being shown on Sky Sports, starting at 22:00 GMT. In the US, it will air on Fox, and also be streamed on the Fox Sports website and app, the NFL+ app, as well as Hulu, fuboTV, Roku TV and Sling TV. Nobody knows for sure. Half-time show set lists and a performer's special guests are shrouded in secrecy to ensure fans are surprised on the night.  But Rihanna should be able to squeeze quite a few of her many hits into the 14-minute set, particularly as performers often play only short snippets of some songs so they can cover more of their back catalogue. Speculating about the possible song list is part of the fun for fans. Gossip outlet Deuxmoi quoted a source last week who suggested Rihanna would stick to her older, best-known hits, but added that the set list is being constantly tweaked and polished. Half-time performers also often invite very special guests to appear alongside them. Coldplay brought out Beyoncé and Bruno Mars, while Katy Perry hosted Missy Elliott and Lenny Kravitz. But the involvement of a guest can often result the most controversial moments of half-time shows, such as Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson's ""wardrobe malfunction"" and M.I.A.'s choice of hand gesture when she joined Madonna. Headlining the Super Bowl is one of the biggest and most prestigious gigs in music, due to the astronomically large TV audience both in the US and around the world. About 100 million viewers watched last year's Super Bowl in the US alone, while Dr. Dre, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Mary J Blige, Kendrick Lamar and 50 Cent's half-time show added a further 160m views on YouTube. In recent years, YouTube has become an increasingly important component of a half-time show's impact. Shakira and Jennifer Lopez, who jointly headlined in 2020, notched up 264m plays of their set - the highest of any half-time show to date. Other headliners at the Super Bowl over the years have included Lady Gaga, Prince, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen and Michael Jackson. Given the number of viewers watching, a well-received and hit-heavy performance can have a huge impact on an artist's streaming and sales figures in the weeks following the Super Bowl. Rihanna's return to live performing has prompted speculation that new music from her could finally be on the way. The singer used to churn out one album a year, but took an extended break from music after 2016's Anti, resurfacing only occasionally to work with other artists. Her last genuinely massive hit was 2017's Wild Thoughts, a collaboration with DJ Khaled and and Bryson Tiller, which the trio performed at the following year's Grammy Awards. Since then, she has had her first child with her partner A$AP Rocky and continued to build her fashion and cosmetics brand Fenty.  As a result. music has taken a back seat, but in 2022 she released her first new solo single for six years, Lift Me Up. That has catapulted Rihanna into this year's film awards season. She attended the Golden Globes last month, where the track was nominated, and she is also up for best original song at the Oscars on 12 March. Her absence from the world of music has lasted so long, the huge anticipation for her new album has become something of a running joke. Comedian Jerrod Carmichael recently made light of the situation when he hosted the Golden Globes.  ""I'm going to say something very controversial,"" he said. ""Rihanna, you take all the time you want on that album girl. Don't let these fools on the internet pressure you into nothing."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-64545100
Ukraine war: Zelensky asks France and Germany for fighter jets,"Ukraine's leader has taken his request for fighter jets to France and Germany after meeting UK officials. President Volodymyr Zelensky met the two countries' leaders in Paris on Wednesday evening, where they pledged ongoing support to Ukraine. France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Olaf Scholz restated their belief that Russia must not win the war. Mr Zelensky will make more requests for jets when he meets European Union leaders in Brussels on Thursday.  He believes the fighter jets and long-range missiles are important in addition to the Leopard 2 tanks Western nations have recently committed to supplying. Speaking at a joint news conference on Wednesday evening with Mr Macron and Mr Scholz, Mr Zelensky said France and Germany had potential to be ""game-changers"" in the battle against Russia by providing Ukraine with battle tanks, modern fighter planes and long-range missiles.  He said the supply of the jets had been discussed, and warned there was ""very little time"" to provide the weaponry. Mr Macron said Ukraine could count on France's support and that the country was ""determined to help Ukraine to victory and the re-establishment of its legitimate rights"". Mr Scholz also said: ""The position is unchanged: Russia must not win this war."" Whether that means the two nations may commit to supplying fighter jets is unclear for now.  Both the French president and German chancellor have at times faced criticism for being too slow to support Ukraine.  Mr Zelensky has previously expressed frustration with Mr Macron, who continued to hold phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin after the invasion.  But the Ukrainian president told French newspaper Le Figaro he believed Mr Macron had changed. He said his commitment to support Ukraine to victory and the fact he ""opened the door"" to tank deliveries last month showed this.  Mr Zelensky's Thursday visit to Brussels comes after he addressed the UK Parliament on Wednesday.  There, he also urged London to supply fighter jets to support Ukraine's war efforts. ""Freedom will win - we know Russia will lose,"" he told a crowd of MPs and peers in Westminster Hall, adding the UK was with his country on a march to ""the most important victory of our lifetime"". Downing Street said Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was investigating what aircraft the UK could potentially offer, but emphasised this was ""a long-term solution"" and that training pilots could take years. Russia has warned there would be a ""response"" from Moscow if anyone did provide Ukraine with aircraft. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64577375
Orca mothers make 'lifelong sacrifice' for sons,"A study of orcas in the North Pacific has revealed that mothers make a ""lifelong sacrifice"" for their sons. Rearing a son significantly reduced a female killer whale's chance of reproducing in the future.  The energy they need to feed sons appears to compromise their health, leaving them less able to reproduce and raise other young. ""Mothers sacrifice their own food and their own energy,"" said Prof Darren Croft from the University of Exeter.  Orcas remain closely bonded to their families throughout their lives. But while young female offspring become independent in adulthood, males depend on their mothers - even demanding a share of the food that their matriarchs catch.  Prof Croft described it as a ""new insight into the complex social lives and family lives of these amazing animals"". The decades-long study, published in the journal Current Biology, is part of an ongoing mission to understand killer whale family life.  It was made possible by the Center for Whale Research (CWR), which has followed the lives of a population of killer whales, known as the Southern Residents, for more than 40 years.  Since 1976, the CWR has produced a complete census of the Southern Resident population, which enabled biologists to carry out multi-generation studies like this one - disentangling critical social behaviour and family bonds that directly impact the animals' survival. For this research, scientists examined the lives of 40 female orcas between 1982 and 2021, and discovered that for each living son, a mother's annual likelihood of rearing another calf to one year old was cut by half. ""Our previous research has shown that sons have a higher chance of survival if their mother is around,"" said Dr Michael Weiss from the University of Exeter and Center for Whale Research.  ""We wanted to find out if this help comes at a price and answer is yes. Killer whale mothers pay a high cost in terms of their future reproduction to keep their sons alive."" The ongoing study of this threatened killer whale population, that lives in the coastal waters between Vancouver and Seattle, was started by Dr Ken Balcomb. Initially, he wanted to examine the threats to their survival. The ensuing work went on to reveal insights into killer whale life that could only have come to light through decades of study.  Biologists have worked with the CWR to reveal, for example, the vital role of killer whale grandmothers and why, like humans, females of this species cease reproduction part way through their lives.  From their years of studying killer whale interactions, scientists already knew that mothers and sons ""hung out"" together well into the male's adulthood. ""They'll even feed their sons salmon they catch,"" explained Prof Croft, whereas adult female offspring will hunt independently. This could, the researchers think, be a kind of evolutionary ""bet-hedging"", driven by the fact that the biggest, oldest males go on to father many offspring.  ""If a mother can get their son to become that big male in the population, then he's the one that will sire [much of the next generation],"" explained Prof Croft.  It may seem paradoxical that such powerful, intelligent animals remain dependent on their mothers through their lives, but it appears that males simply don't have to become independent, because their mother remains by their side.  ""If my mother cooked my dinner for me every night, perhaps I just wouldn't learn to cook my own dinner,"" joked Prof Croft.   ""But, indirectly, it does seem to be in a mother's interest."" There are currently just 73 of these killer whales left, so the scientists say they need to understand anything that could help inform decisions about how to protect these marine mammals.  ""These southern resident killer whales are balancing on a knife-edge and at risk of extinction,"" said Prof Croft. ""So anything that reduces females' reproduction is a concern for this population.""

Chris Mason: The profound questions Zelensky’s European tour poses,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's tour of Europe, for all its photo opportunities, gratitude and applause, is a reminder that the war leaves the UK and Ukraine's allies wrestling with profound questions. It is a conflict without immediate, obvious end. To how many requests from Ukraine can the answer be yes? For how long? At what cost? And with what consequences? To stand in Westminster Hall, with hundreds of others, was to see British politics come together. Witnessing its invited speakers, first hand, is one of the greatest privileges of this job because people are invited to address the Hall at moments of huge import. Last year, the King shortly after the death of Queen Elizabeth. Some years ago - and before my time here - the Pope, Nelson Mandela and Charles de Gaulle. And now Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. This was a cross-party audience poised to applaud at any moment a leader who has become the face and voice of his country, and recognised in much of the world. A defender of his nation and a defender of democracy. But can the UK, should the UK, provide what he wants? This was not just a lofty exposition of a speaker's worldview. It was a leader at war with a specific request. President Zelensky has regularly presented an ambitious list of requests to Ukraine's allies, many of which have often been met, even if not as quickly as he might have hoped. And so to his latest: warplanes for his country's pilots to fly. An observation and demand that amounted to ""thanks for your help but we need lots more"" was wrapped in the arresting rhetoric of a former actor, both comfortable on the public stage and savvy at the stagecraft of performance. Presenting a fighter pilot's helmet to the Speaker of the Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, he pointed to the writing upon it: ""We have freedom, give us wings to protect it."" This was a whole lot more than Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is promising and is not easy to achieve. And not only is President Zelensky asking for it, so is Boris Johnson, the prime minister-before-last who visited Kiev just last month.  So what should we read into the current prime minister's promise later that ""nothing is off the table""? In broad terms, we can read it literally. The UK feels it has a strategic, diplomatic and moral obligation to remain steadfast in its support for Ukraine. But Mr Sunak did not give a specific commitment to provide British planes. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, training pilots takes ages. Secondly, fighter jets require complex engineering support to function properly in a warzone. And thirdly, they would be vulnerable to Russian air defence systems, stationed within Russia - the targeting of which would risk a huge escalation in the war. For all these reasons Lord Robertson, the former secretary general of Nato, told the BBC there were ""huge problems"" with the idea, at least in the short term. But he did suggest that sending a dozen or so Challenger tanks, the first of which the prime minister told us will be on the battlefield under Ukrainian command next month, is not enough. That, he said, is because ""they are defending our front line"" - the continent's front line, and the front line of our values. Those words and this trip from President Zelensky are a reminder that the challenges and questions posed by this ongoing war to the UK and its European neighbours are likely to last for a long time to come.

"Disney to cut 7,000 jobs in major shake-up of firm","Disney chief executive Bob Iger says he is cutting 7,000 jobs as part of a major shake-up of the entertainment giant. The layoffs are part of a plan to save $5.5bn in costs and make the Disney+ streaming service profitable. The move comes as Mr Iger announced the first set of financial results since his return to the company in November. The figures showed a rise in earnings but the first drop in Disney+ subscribers since its launch in 2019. ""We believe the work we are doing to reshape our company around creativity, while reducing expenses, will lead to sustained growth and profitability for our streaming business, better position us to weather future disruption and global economic challenges, and deliver value for our shareholders,"" Mr Iger said. The  job cuts amount to around 3.6% of Disney's workforce around the world. Mr Iger made the restructuring announcement alongside financial results for the last three months of 2022. The figures showed that revenue rose 8% to $23.5bn (£19.45bn) for the period and net income was up by 11% to $1.3bn. During the quarter the number of Disney+ subscribers fell by around 2.4m to 161.8m. The plan will see the company restructure into three segments - an entertainment unit, including film, TV and streaming; a sports-focused ESPN unit; and Disney parks, experiences and products. ""This reorganisation will result in a more cost-effective, coordinated approach to our operations,"" Mr Iger told analysts on a conference call. The company's streaming service remained its top priority, he added. Disney shares rose by more than 5% in extended trade after the announcement. The changes address some of the criticisms raised in recent months by billionaire activist investor Nelson Peltz, who criticised Disney of overspending on its streaming business. In response to the announcement Mr Peltz's Trian Group said: ""We are pleased that Disney is listening."" Mr Iger made a shock return as Disney's chief executive, less than a year after he retired from the firm. He was brought back to steer the company through turbulent times after its share price plummeted and Disney+ continued to make a loss. Mr Iger, who had previously headed Disney for 15 years, replaced Bob Chapek, who took over as chief executive in February 2020. Mr Chapek was ousted after Disney's streaming business posted a $1.5bn quarterly loss. Less than 24 hours after his return to Disney, Mr Iger said he was planning a major shake-up of the business. At the time he said he had tasked a group of executives with designing ""a new structure that puts more decision-making back in the hands of our creative teams and rationalises costs"".

NHS to use test that prevents babies going deaf,"A rapid test that can help preserve the hearing of newborn babies is set to be used by NHS hospitals.  For some babies, commonly used antibiotics can become toxic. The drugs damage sensory cells inside the ear leading to permanent hearing loss.   The test - which analyses babies' DNA - can quickly spot those who are vulnerable. It means they can be given a different type of antibiotic and avoid having a lifetime of damaged hearing.  Gentamicin is the first-choice antibiotic if a newborn develops a serious bacterial infection. It is life-saving and safe for the majority of people.  However, it has a rare side effect. About 1,250 babies in England and Wales are born with a subtle change in their genetic code that allows the antibiotic to bind more strongly to the hair cells in their ears, where it becomes toxic. These tiny hairs help convert sounds into the electrical signals that are understood by the brain. If they are damaged, it results in hearing loss.   The side effect is well known, but until now there was no test that could get the results fast enough. It would be dangerous to delay treatment, and alternative antibiotics are not used as they have their own side effects and because of concerns about antibiotic resistance. The new genedrive kit analyses a sample taken from inside the baby's cheek. Tests at two neonatal intensive care units in Manchester and Liverpool showed it could spot who was susceptible to hearing loss in 26 minutes, and using it did not delay treatment. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) - which decides which drugs and technologies the NHS uses - has provisionally approved the test. Mark Chapman, interim director of medical technology at NICE, said: ""Hearing loss has a substantial impact on the quality of the life of the baby and their family. ""Having this test available to NHS staff can avoid the risk of hearing loss in babies with the variant who need treatment with antibiotics."" He also said the costs of treating hearing loss was ""high"". Fitting a pair of cochlear implants - which use a microphone to convert sounds to an electrical signal - costs about £65,000.  The NICE recommendations apply directly to England and Wales, but are often adopted more widely.  The test will be made available as part of an early assessment to consider how well it works in a range of hospitals, and to see what impact it has on antibiotic use, before it gets final approval. Susan Daniels, chief executive of the National Deaf Children's Society, said: ""It's very encouraging that more evidence will be gathered on this important development.  ""I hope this additional evidence will support the argument for the rollout of technology which could play a pivotal role in preventing deafness in a small number of babies in the future.""

Kerala transgender couple's 'tears of joy' as baby born early,"A transgender couple from the southern Indian state of Kerala, whose pregnancy photos made global news, have welcomed their baby with ""tears of joy"". Ziya Paval said her partner Zahad had given birth to the baby on Wednesday morning. Ms Paval shared the news on Instagram, posting a photo of the baby who was born nearly a month early. They told the BBC that both Mr Zahad and the baby, whose name and gender they have not revealed, were fine. Ms Paval and Mr Zahad, who uses only one name, have said it was their dream to become parents. The couple had paused their hormone therapy during the duration of the pregnancy. Their pregnancy was considered a rarity in India because ""no one else has called themselves a biological parent in the transgender community as far as we know"", the couple told the BBC earlier this week. The two had been at different stages of their respective gender transition processes when they decided to have a baby one-and-a-half years ago. They had then paused their hormone therapy on doctor's advice. On Wednesday, as they shared the baby's photo, the couple said they were thankful for the prayers and support of their well-wishers. Since the announcement of the baby's birth, congratulations have poured in for the couple on their social media pages.

Australia to remove Chinese surveillance cameras amid security fears,"Australia will remove Chinese-made surveillance cameras from defence sites over national security fears. It comes after an audit found 900 pieces of surveillance equipment built by companies Hikvision and Dahua on government estates. The UK and US made similar moves last year, citing fears the device data may be accessed by the Chinese government. Hikvision says those fears are unfounded. Dahua has not responded to a request for comment. The audit of Australian government sites found the cameras and security gear were located on more than 200 buildings, in almost every department - including the foreign affairs and attorney general's departments. At least one unit was also found in the defence department, but the total number at defence sites is unknown. Defence Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles on Thursday said the government would find and remove the cameras from any defence locations to make them ""completely secure"". ""I don't think we should overstate [the seriousness]... but it's a significant thing that's been brought to our attention and we're going to fix it,"" he said, adding the devices pre-dated his time in office. Attorney General Mark Dreyfus said the government will review whether the cameras on other government buildings need to be removed as well.  Shadow Minister for Cyber Security James Paterson, who requested the audit, says they do. Australia has ""no way"" of knowing whether data collected by the devices is being handed over to Chinese intelligence agencies, he said. China's national security law can be used to compel any organisation or citizen to ""support, assist and co-operate with the state intelligence work"". Senator Paterson also argued Australia should not be supporting Hikvision and Dahua for ""moral"" reasons. He said both companies have been directly implicated in the alleged human rights abuses and mass surveillance of Uyghurs in Xinjiang. Hikvision says it is ""categorically false"" to represent them as a threat to national security. ""No respected technical institution or assessment has come to this conclusion,"" a spokeswoman said. The company says it cannot access end users' video data and therefore cannot transmit it to third parties, she said.  But in November the UK also blocked the installation of any new surveillance cameras made by Dahua and Hikvision on ""sensitive sites"" due to security concerns. It also said it would review whether devices already in place should be removed. Days later the US banned the sale and import of new communications equipment from five China-based companies including Dahua and Hikvision. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he was unconcerned about how the Chinese government might react to the move. ""We act in accordance with Australia's national interest. We do so transparently and that's what we will continue to do,"" he told reporters. Ties between China and Australia had soured after Canberra banned Huawei from its 5G network in 2018, and China responded with trade restrictions and tariffs on Australian exports such as coal, lobsters and wine.  But relations have been improving under the centre-left government, which came to power in May 2022. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-64577641
Mum traumatised by Nottingham maternity failings gives birth to girl,"A woman whose son died after failings in a crisis-hit maternity unit has given birth to a girl. Kim Errington, 39, gave birth to her daughter Elfi almost two years after she lost her son Teddy, when he was a day old. An inquest heard there were ""undoubted failings"" by the healthcare professionals involved in Teddy's care. Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust said it had ""learned lessons and implemented changes"" as a result. Ms Errington and her partner Jason were among the parents who called for an independent review of the trust, led by midwife Donna Ockenden, which is currently ongoing. It will examine how dozens of babies died or were injured at the trust's two hospitals, the Queen's Medical Centre and Nottingham City Hospital, where Teddy was born. In December 2020, the trust's maternity services were rated inadequate with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) finding ""several serious concerns"". Ms Errington said Elfi, who was born in November, was ""gorgeous"". ""She's a beautiful, chilled, happy little baby,"" she said. She said she had been ""very anxious"" about the pregnancy but praised the care she had received at King's Mill, the hospital where she chose to have her second child, and is run by Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Trust. ""Our care was amazing,"" she said. ""[It was] truly outstanding. There was not a single issue, not a stone left unturned. ""And I don't think it was because we were getting special treatment. People were obviously aware of our situation and took extra care."" She said Ms Ockenden's review meant she finally felt as if her experience of losing Teddy was being taken seriously. ""We all felt such relief,"" she said, recalling her reaction at Ms Ockenden's appointment. ""Now the big bulk of work is still to do. ""The hospital [needs put] those changes in place and that's when we will really know whether we are being listened to. ""We've been given the opportunity to meet the new chief executive, and I have taken him up on that offer and look forward to that meeting. ""But it's not a one-off; it's got to be a continued practise of listening and reacting, not lip service. ""Let's see if some real change happens and we'll see."" Anthony May, chief executive at the trust, has told the BBC: ""We are committed to making the necessary and sustainable improvements to our maternity services and continue to engage fully and openly with Donna Ockenden and her team on their independent review. ""We are not waiting for the review to conclude before making changes and our staff have been working hard to make the necessary improvements now.""

Netflix's You: Why Penn Badgley accepts Joe Goldberg,"Hello, you. Netflix's most notorious fictional killer Joe Goldberg is back - but, this time, with a twist. For season four of the thriller, he's moved to London, taken up a job as a literature professor and infiltrated a group of incredibly wealthy friends. London might be new to Joe - but it isn't new to Penn Badgley, the actor famous for Joe's creepy voiceovers. ""I wasn't able to be with my family as much as I would have liked to,"" he tells BBC Newsbeat about filming last year. ""Apart from that, it was a great time, I remember it so fondly. I do truly love something of the culture there. ""My wife is British, she was born and raised there until she was a teenager so I just really truly did enjoy it."" So Penn enjoyed being in the UK, but what about his famous character? ""I think in some ways he settled in quite nicely, apart from the fact that he's Joe Goldberg and he can't settle in anywhere nicely,"" he says. ""[London is] the source of the fantasies in Joe's mind about how people should be, the literature that he loves. ""He's really trying to make a go of it and I think at the beginning you see him on one level doing a good enough job. ""Of course by the end of the first episode, you discover that's not the case."" This series also sees the introduction of British actors like new love interest Charlotte Ritchie and Tilly Keeper, who was previously in EastEnders, as a famous It girl. Tati Gabrielle also returns as Marienne, another of Joe's love interests - yes, he's had a few. ""When I found out he was coming to London, I was really quite thrilled,"" Tilly says.  ""I think it really plays into this nice kind of dark academia vibe we've got going on this season."" Joe has always been a controversial character. And there have been concerns that the show glamorises stalking and male violence against women.  Penn has spoken - at length - about how much he hates Joe, there's even YouTube compilations dedicated to clips of him criticising the character in interviews.  Speaking to Newsbeat, Penn clarifies that he doesn't ""despise"" Joe - but does say that he finds it draining playing the character.  ""It takes a lot of emotional, spiritual and physical energy to play him for so long,"" he says. ""Because he's such an unreliable narrator and so inconsistently manic. He's predictably unpredictable. ""But I think more than ever, I probably accept him and I think I think despising him would take up even more energy, which I don't want to give him."" Penn might be tired of Joe's antics, but there's no sign that this will be the last series. ""That's a question for the writers. I think the question is, is there another season? ""And I think for those who haven't seen it yet, I don't want to spoil whether or not that's possible."" Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.

Mass tree-planting in Chippenham to boost park,"Almost 2,000 trees are to be planted in Monkton Park in Chippenham. A total of 1,720 trees are planned and the first stage of the work is due to be completed by 10 February. Lower Riverside Meadow will be planted with trees and shrubs. Chippenham Town Council's Environmental Services Team began the work on 6 February as part of the wider Monkton Park Management Plan to improve the site. The project also aims to create woodland areas to help combat climate change and improve wellbeing. Care will be taken to ensure the trees survive the early stages, with plans to make regular checks to monitor damage from animals such as deer, according to the eLocal Democracy Reporting Service. Wiltshire Wildlife Trust said: ""Overall, the aim is to reach a point where roughly 55% of the site is managed as open grassland, 25% managed as scrub belts or islands and 20% as woodland. ""Distribution will be key to ensure pockets, belts and islands of plantings rather than larger expanses of dense monoculture. ""The idea is to create a habitat mosaic, offering opportunity for people to walk between planted areas, following meandering mown pathways."" The planting is to take place over three years, with roughly a third of the area planted in a year. Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

North Korea parades largest-ever ICBM missile suite,"North Korea has shown its largest display ever of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), a number analysts say could potentially challenge the US' defence system. More than a dozen long-range ICBMs were shown at Wednesday's military parade. Leader Kim Jong-un was seen at the midnight parade with his young daughter elevated to his side. Kim Chu-ae's appearance has fuelled speculation she's being positioned as her father's successor. The number of long-range missiles shown in the parade has prompted concern. Analysts say such a number of the missiles - which can in theory hit as far as the US mainland - could potentially overwhelm US nuclear defences if each missile carried multiple war heads. North Korea's media did not provide detail, but said such an arsenal demonstrated the country's ""mighty war deterrence and counterattack capabilities"". Pictures published by North Korean media on Thursday morning appeared to show more than a dozen ICBMs rolling through the central square of Pyongyang - accompanied by an army of foot solders. Some North Korea analysts, looking at satellite pictures, said the display also appeared to include a new ICBM launcher designed to accommodate a solid-fuel missile.  Solid-fuel missiles can be launched more quickly than liquid-fuel missiles, which will significantly enhance retaliatory capabilities.  However, solid-fuel missiles have not been successfully tested by Kim's regime. ""This is one of North Korea's major nuclear modernisation goals,"" said Ankit Panda, a nuclear policy specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""We should expect to see the first flight tests of longer-range solid fuel missiles in the coming months,"" he told the BBC. He added the expansion of North Korea's ICBM arsenal presented potentially ""serious military planning challenges"" for the US in a conflict, as it would be difficult for the US to find and destroy all of North Korea's mobile ICBMs. The parade comes after a record year of missile testing by North Korea in breach of UN economic sanctions. That has led to several flare-ups of tensions on the Korean peninsula. The state's Korean Central News Agency reported the parade stressed the country's ability to face down its enemies ""nuke for nuke, confrontation for confrontation"". Images published showed Mr Kim clad in a black coat and fedora inspecting rows of soldiers holding bayonets, and saluting as troops and missile units paraded past.  He was also photographed observing the parade from a balcony with Chu-ae by his side. The elevation of Chu-ae - who is believed to be 10 or 11 years old - has been another key talking point for observers. State media photographs showed her taking centre stage at a pre-parade banquet with military leaders, where she was seated in the centre between Mr Kim and his wife Ri Sol Ju, a spot usually given to her father. The trio was pictured smiling and flanked by top military commanders. Ms Ri was also seen wearing a necklace with a pendant in the shape of a Hwasong-17 ICBM, North Korea's largest missile which was test-launched last year. While some analysts say this points to Chu-ae as Mr Kim's heir apparent, others say the state may be portraying the North Korean leader as a ""family man"". ""The inclusion of Kim's daughter in the banquet was difficult to miss. North Korea's state propagandists are clearly try to portray Kim Jong Un as a family man, but the exclusion of his other reported daughter is curious,"" said Martyn Williams, a senior fellow at Stimson Center who focuses on North Korea. Kim Jong-un reportedly has at least three children, including an elder son and a younger daughter. Chu-ae is believed to be his second child. She only made her first appearance in public three months ago in November, when her father took her to the launch of a major ICBM launch. While succession positioning may ultimately be the case, it is ""too early"" to arrive at the conclusion, Mr Williams told the BBC. Mr Panda said Chu-ae's prominence in recent months could indicate that Kim expects his country's nuclear enterprise to become a multi-generational affair.

Japan arrests 'Luffy' robbery suspects after Philippine deportation,"Japanese police have arrested four men for allegedly orchestrating scams and robberies while jailed overseas, in a case that has gripped the country. Authorities say they targeted the elderly, and stole or cheated their victims of billions of yen. From their jail in the Philippines, the men managed to recruit accomplices in Japan to carry out the robberies. One of them is said to be the mastermind, who calls himself ""Luffy"" after a popular anime character. Philippine authorities deported two of them, Kiyoto Imamura and Toshiya Fujita, to Japan earlier this week.  The other two - Yuki Watanabe and Tomonobu Kojima - arrived in Japan on Wednesday night. They are among dozens of Japanese nationals who have been arrested in the Philippines since late 2019 on suspicion of involvement in the so-called ""Luffy"" gang.

Strikes: PCS union members to begin action across north west,"Civil servants in the government's biggest department are set to start 20 days of strikes on Thursday. Members of the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) working for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will be involved in the action. The PCS said about 500 of its members in offices in Bolton and Stockport and 170 in jobcentres in Liverpool will strike in the coming weeks. It is part of the dispute over pay, jobs, pensions and conditions. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: ""Our members are absolutely livid at being at the bottom of the heap when it comes to pay. ""They worked tirelessly through the pandemic, delivering universal credit to millions, yet find themselves treated with disdain by the same government that clapped them a few short years ago. ""They have had enough of poverty pay and being taken for granted, which is why they're taking extended action. ""Ministers can stop the strike tomorrow if they put some money on the table.""

Cervical cancer: Health trusts miss abnormal cells in smear tests,"A woman who has been diagnosed with cervical cancer has learned that she had three previous abnormal smear tests that were missed.    Susan, not her real name, had to undergo a radical hysterectomy when a test in 2020 revealed cancerous cells.  The 45-year-old said she was devastated at the diagnosis and shocked and upset that previous tests had been misread.  The Southern and Western trusts, which were involved in Susan's care, have apologised. After hearing Susan's story, BBC News NI found that the Southern Health Trust (SHT) is beginning a review or risk assessment, which will be carried out by the Royal College of Pathology.  The review is expected to take 10 weeks to complete and could affect hundreds of women.  It will attempt to establish if there was a greater chance of missing abnormalities in screening samples in the trust between 2019 and 2021. The SHT has confirmed that ""work involving a number of screening staff will be examined as part of the risk assessment"". Susan said her world fell apart when, at 42, she was told she had cancer and needed a hysterectomy.  ""I was plunged into the menopause and dealing with that was horrendous. It affected me physically, mentally and emotionally,"" she said. While Susan was getting back on her feet she was asked by the Western trust if she would like to come in for a review of her case history.  Susan described what followed as ""totally shocking and devastating"".  ""They told me that, not only did they miss one smear test, they missed three over 10 years.  ""You put your trust in the medical profession, the people that are supposed to analyse these smear tests. You put your trust in them and somebody didn't do their job properly."" BBC News NI discovered the Southern Health Trust misread Susan's smear test result in 2011 while the Western Health Trust missed abnormal cells in tests in 2014 and 2017.  A Serious Adverse Incident (SAI) was launched after she asked both trusts to investigate.  It concluded if test results ""had been correctly identified as abnormal the management advice for the patient would have been different and would have resulted in a direct referral for colposcopy"". It aims to prevent cervical cancer - by identifying and treating abnormalities that could develop into cancer if left untreated.  But screening cannot identify every single case of cancer or pre-cancer - it is not a diagnostic test for cancer.  In Northern Ireland, screening is offered to women between the ages of 25 and 64. Susan said she has told her story to alert other women - and that she's met others in a similar position.  It comes as all of Northern Ireland's health trusts are carrying out reviews of cervical cancer cases going back a number of years - some are probing as far back as 2008.  This was prompted by two developments: Susan said what women did in the Republic had a massive impact as ""without those women making a noise and getting things put in place"", the audits in Northern Ireland may not have happened. Figures obtained by BBC News NI, via Freedom of Information requests from all the health trusts, indicate there were serious issues with at least nine of the 227 cervical cancer diagnoses across Northern Ireland in the three years up to 2021.  In 2020 in the Western Health Trust, of the 10 women who had received a cervical cancer diagnosis, half of them, including Susan, had the most serious category three findings. Not all women have been informed of the review process.  It takes a great deal of courage to talk publicly about a personal trauma - it also requires courage to take on a health trust.  By doing both, Susan has made women aware of the 2019 cervical audit and their right to be informed of personal data including misread smear results.  As Susan told me, women must be encouraged to come forward to receive it via billboards and public discussion.  The 2019 Audit of Invasive Cervical Cancers and Disclosure of Findings asked trusts to take forward duty of candour in relation to findings. According to Susan, while she was informed of the misread results she had to fight for a Serious Adverse Incident review into her case.   Thanks to Susan, we are now more aware of our right to disclosure of results.  Other places have taken this further. Following his review of the cervical crisis in the Republic, Dr Gabriel Scally said ""open disclosure should be mandatory"". The then Taoiseach Micheál Martin said to protect women's health there was a need for legislation and cultural change.        BBC News NI can reveal that not all women affected have been told of the 2019 audit and subsequent review of their personal records. The way figures are handled varies across the trusts, as does the way information is shared with patients. For instance, the Western Trust said it would like to ""inform women between 2008 - 16 of the audit review but they have limited specialist staff"" - whereas some women in the Southern Trust have been informed of audit review.  It is understood there is a massive backlog of cervical smear tests which have yet to be checked across all of the health trusts - this is due to a shortage of specialist staff.  The PHA said it was ""assured that all trusts have operationalised the framework guidance that was issued in 2019"" - and all the trusts, except the South Eastern, said they were satisfied that the guidance had been implemented. The PHA added the timing of disclosure [of previous diagnoses] would be dependent on an individual woman's treatment journey and personal choice. Dr Brid Farrell, from the PHA, said every year in Northern Ireland about 80 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer, with approximately 110,000 women getting the test. She added that the cervical screening programme is effective at reducing the number of cases in Northern Ireland. However, she said, there were ""occasions when we get what we call a false negative and we will have missed a case, and it's really important that we learn from cases like this so that we can improve our screening programme"".  The PHA advised the Southern Health trust to bring in the Royal College of Pathologists to conduct a review of the Southern Trust's screening programme.  Dr Farrell confirmed to BBC News NI the PHA was putting a plan in place to try and address the backlog of screening cases and get back to where the system was pre-pandemic.  Western Trust: It decided to inform women in 2017 and 2018 that an audit was taking place regarding their smear tests.  That followed a recommendation from the hyponatraemia report about trusts being open and transparent.   It is now reviewing all cases between 2008-2019 and will ""endeavour to complete initial contact with patients by the end of 2023"". Southern Trust: Between 2008 and 2018, 161 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer.  Fewer than five of those women in each year have been informed of the ongoing review into their smear tests.  Following a review, the tests of at least 27 women, were not consistent with their most recent result.   The Southern trust said the audit process for patients from 2020/21 onwards has been ""delayed in response to a request from the PHA to have the smear tests of these women externally reviewed"".  Both the Western and Southern Trusts have said they are applying recommendations from the investigation. Belfast Trust: Before 2014 ""audit review activity was intermittent"", said the trust.  Since 2019, 64 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer - fewer than five have so far received the outcome of their review. South Eastern Trust: 44 women diagnosed with cervical cancer since 2019.  Fewer than five have been offered disclosure of any review outcomes, but the trust said the ""process was ongoing"". Northern Trust: 37 women diagnosed since 2019. The trust said all women have been informed of reviews from 2014. If you have been affected by any of the issues in this story, you can contact the BBC Action Line for support.

Nursing applications in Scotland fall by almost a quarter,"The number of applicants to nursing courses in Scotland has fallen by 24% compared with the same point last year. University admissions service UCAS said that by January, 5,070 people had applied to study nursing in Scotland this year, compared to 6,690 in 2022.  The drop is the biggest of any UK nation and has increased concerns about an NHS staffing crisis. The Scottish government says up to 1,000 more applications could be made for funded courses starting in autumn.  Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said nursing students in Scotland are offered ""the most generous support package in the UK"". It comes after the Royal College of Nursing paused a strike announcement following talks with the Scottish government over a backdated pay deal.  Although the application rate could increase in the coming months, the acceptance rate for undergraduate nursing courses fell by 8% in 2022 compared to the previous year. Eileen McKenna, RCN Scotland associate director, said the figures were ""very worrying"" at a time when there are more than 4,600 vacancies for registered nurses in Scotland.  ""The Scottish government must act now to ensure nursing is seen as an attractive and rewarding career,"" she said. ""They need to reward today's experienced staff with a fair pay rise and demonstrate that a career in nursing shouldn't come with a personal financial sacrifice. ""They need to ensure nursing students have adequate financial support to allow them to prioritise their education and cope with the rising cost of living."" The new UCAS figures show applications fell by 18% in England, 17% in Northern Ireland and 22% in Wales - an 18% decline overall across the UK since January 2022. It is the second consecutive year that nursing applicants have decreased across the UK, while in Scotland, applicant numbers have fallen from 7,920 in 2021. The decline in nursing course applicants has been linked to the increased demand for nurses during the Covid pandemic, causing applications to soar.  But the RCN has said the current rate is still below pre-pandemic levels. Mr Yousaf said: ""Funded places on undergraduate nursing and midwifery courses have doubled in the last decade and we would hope to see further applications to these courses up to the deadline, which could be up to an extra 1,000 based on previous years. ""Scotland offers the most generous support package in the UK, with the nursing and midwifery student bursary raised to £10,000, free tuition and support with placement expenses, uniforms, disclosure and health checks."" The health secretary added that talks were continuing with nursing unions on a new pay deal.  Opposition figures pointed to record levels of vacancies in Scotland's NHS, with an estimated 6,000 nursing and midwifery posts unfilled. Scottish Conservative health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane called on Mr Yousaf to resign. He said the decrease was unsurprising ""when would-be students are hearing of the intolerable strain nurses are under in our SNP-mismanaged health service"".  Scottish Labour health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said: ""Until nursing is properly valued by the Scottish government, these problems will continue.  ""The SNP must act now to ensure that nursing is still seen as the rewarding career that it has always been."" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader and health spokesperson Alex Cole-Hamilton called on the Scottish government to invest in workforce planning.  He added: ""Pay disputes and poor working conditions have taken a heavy toll on the mental health of nurses.  ""No wonder many potential applicants will look at the state of Scotland's nursing sector and turn away."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-64573458

Ipswich: Appeal for memories of town's industrial heritage,"The port of Ipswich was once a thriving hub of industry and engineering, tapping into the zeal of eager young apprentices for their workforces. Now the theatre group Eastern Angles is compiling an archive of the people who earned a living there, called Work Furnace, which it hopes will reignite the spirit of the town's disappearing industrial age. The project, funded by Historic England, wants to hear from former workers in Ipswich who remember their time at the town's factories and workshops.  Martin Stiff, 78, worked as a constructional plater for Ransomes & Rapier - an engineering manufacturing firm that made railway equipment and cranes.  He began as an apprentice in April 1959, based at the Waterside Works on the west bank of the River Orwell. ""As apprentices, we made more money in bonuses than wages,"" Mr Stiff said. ""My first [weekly] wage was one pound, 19 shillings and tuppence [£1.96 in decimal currency]. I used to give mum the pound and keep 19 and tuppence for myself.   ""Every time I pass a cement mixer in my car, I think 'pounds, shillings and pence'. I used the money to travel to Ipswich Town games.  ""With us lads, the comradeship was unbelievable. We used to go on holidays together, Skegness, Bognor Regis, Barry Island, half a dozen of us.  ""We used to go to the football, we were at college together in Colchester. ""We used to work hard, grafting."" He says he feels sad that companies like his no longer exist. ""Wherstead Road, Nacton Road, the railway workshops, the amount of people that used to be involved in engineering - where are they working now? ""I got a job at Crane's to have a bit of change on the Thursday; on the Friday I opened The Star to see they were making about 400 redundant. It happened overnight."" Sylvia Halls, 84, worked in the laboratory at Manganese Bronze, which was based on Hadleigh Road, from 1952 until 1958. The company produced non-ferrous metals for, among other things, shell casings and ship propellers. Sylvia says she earned 35 shillings in her first pay packet in 1952: ""That's just over a pound because we were told that we were apprentices"". ""In the laboratory it was good because there was a lot of us, a lot of girls, so we had great times because we all worked together and started from the same thing. ""We were treated very well by the men, in fact I think they felt very protective of us. We worked in a foundry lab, a smaller lab.  ""They couldn't cast their furnace until we said it was OK; they put up with waiting very well.  ""The foundrymen were quite rough and ready, but they used to try not to swear when they came into the lab; one of them could hardly talk."" Sylvia's husband also worked at the firm for 40 years. ""There was Manganese Bronze and Eastern Counties Farmers there and then it just got rundown and wasn't needed any more,"" she said. ""I think it's sad and I think there's not going to be enough apprentices to get it started again.  ""That's what we were called, but we didn't end up with any certificates or anything; that was used in a way to give us not very much money. ""Where do youngsters go for jobs now?"" Hannah Houghton, project officer for Work Furnace, said the aim was to ""celebrate people's stories"". Thousands of people worked in the town's buzzing industrial areas, and the project is holding Factory Sessions which will cover sectors including clothing, food and drink, printing, tobacco and fertiliser, with names including Jaegar, Britton & Bannister, Betabake, John Player & Churchman's, Fisons and Trident Cars. ""There are visible reminders everywhere, if you walk down Ipswich waterfront you can see remnants of the flour mill, of Pauls Malt,"" Ms Houghton says. ""Where there were factories, there are now houses. ""Ipswich is known for its agricultural background in terms of industry, but it's becoming clear to me that it was a key engineering and clothing manufacturing town, so different to what it is today. ""Who better to talk to about what these places were like than the people that powered these companies - the workers."" She says more than 700 people have already shared footage, photos and memories on a dedicated Facebook page.  ""We've only scraped the surface,"" she added. ""Some of these companies fell or closed very suddenly. ""There's a sadness and perhaps a little anger in those accounts of people who gave their absolute all to their jobs; their dads worked there; they have a family history. ""But I think that pride the workers feel will resonate."" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

York skeleton reveals lifestyle of medieval anchoress,"A skeleton found during excavations at a site in York in 2007 is believed to be a medieval religious hermit. Researchers at the University of Sheffield have identified the remains as possibly being those of Lady Isabel German, who died in the 15th Century. Hers was one of 667 complete skeletons discovered in a dig at the site of a former church at the York Barbican. Archaeologist Dr Lauren McIntyre said Lady German would have been ""a highly significant figure"" in the community. She was an anchoress, a woman who was walled into a cell to live a life of prayer and contemplation, who lived at All Saints Church in Fishergate in York, the researchers said. The skeleton was found in the apse of the church foundations, a small room located behind the altar, where only clergy or wealthy people were buried. Dr McIntyre said the woman had septic arthritis and advanced venereal syphilis, which would have left her disfigured. ""Lady German lived in a period of history where we typically think of there being a strong association between visible and disfiguring illnesses and sin, with that type of suffering seen as a punishment from God,"" Dr McIntyre said. ""Such severe disease could also have been viewed positively, being sent by God to grant martyr-like status to someone special."" But she said Lady German may also have chosen ""to devote herself to a life of solitude as a way to remain autonomous and in control of her own destiny"". The skeletons excavated at York Barbican dated to the Roman, Medieval, and Civil War eras. Lady German's story will feature in an episode of Digging for Britain to be broadcast on 12 February at 20:00 GMT on BBC Two. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Roman helmet handle found at Priors Hall Park could show extended military presence,"A bronze artefact found near a recently discovered Roman road suggests soldiers remained in the area after they built it. The depiction of two dolphins found in excavations at Priors Hall Park, Corby in Northamptonshire, was originally thought to be a Roman buckle. But specialists recently revealed it to be the handle of a 2nd Century helmet. Archaeologist Nick Gilmour said it could suggest a ""link to the military continued"" after the road was built. Archaeologists have been involved at the site - earmarked for more than 5,000 homes - for about 12 years. They first uncovered a temple/mausoleum that was turned into a pottery, brick and tile manufacturing centre but during a second phase of work in 2021, they found an intact Roman road that showed Corby joined to surrounding settlements. Mr Gilmour said the bronze artefact, about 5cm (2in) long and showing ""two dolphins facing each other as if they had jumped out of the water"", was the sort of thing that was frequently found on Roman buckles so when they found it at the site, that is what it was thought to be. But after further investigations, a professor of Roman military equipment told them it was 95% certain it was the handle of a 2nd Century helmet. ""Its shape looks like a buckle but you can see it's not broken off and you can see where the rivets went through,"" Mr Gilmour said. ""We had found this road built in the 1st Century and roads were built by the army so we know they were in the area then. ""[The find] could suggest that some link to the military continued on the site after the construction of the road."" The archaeologist added that it was possible to date the find to the 2nd or early 3rd Centuries because the Roman army had stopped using them after that. ""The purpose of a helmet is to deflect things from you but if you put a handle on it, it catches stuff and flaps up and down,"" he said. ""It makes it easier to carry but stops the function of the helmet so they stopped using them."" Mr Gilmour said the question that remained was whether a single piece of evidence was enough to show the military still had a presence at the site in the 2nd Century. ""The answer is 'probably' otherwise why would part of a helmet be there,"" he said, ""but it's only one fragment. ""It is also possible that it was a piece of bronze brought to the site to be recycled and reused. ""That's the more mundane explanation but we'd like to think the military had maintained a presence there."" By the middle of the 1st Century, people living in the area focused on iron production and an iron smelting site 1 km (0.6km) away was found in 2006. Mr Gilmour said the Romans had also been in the area because of the ironworks as it was a metal they needed for weapons. He said it would have been ""sensible"" for them to keep a ""smaller outlying garrison"" there to ""keep control of the iron"". ""A military presence does not mean they were there to fight the locals but they would be doing administration, tax and road repairs etc, so it would make sense to have them there to oversee it,"" he said. ""We'd like [this to be the case] but it's hard to prove."" He said everything metal found at the site was being conserved and cleaned and would be reanalysed for other evidence as smaller details not seen before could become visible. For example, a few coins need to be cleaned to see which emperor is on them. ""Some coins are associated with the military,"" he said. ""For example an emperor may commission a commemorative coin to thank soldiers for their service, but those aren't usually spent, so if you find one of those you've basically found a soldier.""

MP calls for more health services in Leighton Buzzard,"An MP has said more health services need to be provided in a town that has seen thousands of new homes built. Conservative MP for South West Bedfordshire Andrew Selous will attend a meeting later regarding the future of health services in Leighton Buzzard. Mr Selous said 15,000 new people had moved to the town in the past 20 years and facilities could not meet demand. Central Bedfordshire Council said it wanted to ""enable the provision"" of health services locally. In January, the Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes Integrated Care Board decided to drop plans to build a health hub and a fourth GP practice in Leighton Buzzard. Mr Selous said he was ""upset"" by the decision as more facilities were ""desperately needed"". Felicity Cox, chief executive of the Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes Integrated Care Board, said it was seeking additional GPs for the areas but a national shortage was ""one issue"". Ms Cox said across the three areas, the care board had recruited 25 additional GPs since 2019. ""We did have a developer offer us a parcel of land to build a GP practice on but unfortunately we have no capital or revenue to cover that,"" she said. Ms Cox said the board had to ""prioritise"" its expenditure and Leighton Buzzard was not the area with the highest growth in its patch. She said the board was working with partner agencies to look at how they could develop healthcare services in the area. Edith Griffith is the chairwoman of patient participation groups in Leighton Buzzard. The 73-year-old said it was ""extremely difficult"" to get a GP appointment in the town. ""It's taking six weeks at the moment, before Christmas it was seven,"" she said. ""We've got an amazing doctors surgery with great people who work really hard but they're under extreme pressure."" Ms Griffith said the area had seen ""a huge amount of building"" with ""more yet to come"". ""I'm not sure what the plan is,"" she said. ""We have nothing extra for all these thousands of houses, so I'm not sure how they think it's going to work."" Ms Griffith said residents were having to travel to Luton, Milton Keynes, Northampton, Bedford and High Wycombe for some appointments. ""What we need is a health hub or a medical centre in Leighton Buzzard which has services for our community,"" she said. ""If people can't get a GP appointment, they go downhill and they become hospital cases."" Josh Best said the town needed more infrastructure. ""Leighton Buzzard is just overpopulated,"" the 23-year-old said. ""The infrastructure is not built for it and the GP surgeries are overly busy. ""If you want an appointment you can't get one. ""They do it all via online appointments now and last time I looked it was booked up for at least three months. ""They're building houses everywhere and there's nothing to go with it."" David Taylor has lived in Leighton Buzzard for nine years. ""When we came here there were three of four GP surgeries and it was adequate,"" he said. ""Since then the town has grown substantially and no additional GP facilities have been available."" The leader of Central Bedfordshire Council, Richard Wenham, said: ""We have long shared an ambition with our NHS providers to deliver several health and care hubs to enable the provision of more GP services and other health and care services locally.  Mr Wenham said the council hoped to build a health hub in the area but it ""cannot provide the GPs and other health professionals, only the health service can do this""   ""It is imperative that the provision of primary care services grows at a similar rate to meet the needs of current and new communities,"" he said Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Thechikottukavu Ramachandran: The 'killer' Indian elephant who's loved and feared,"A controversial elephant in the southern Indian state of Kerala is back in the news after a local temple bid a record amount for his participation in its annual festival. BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi explains why the 57-year-old animal evokes both admiration and compassion. Thechikottukavu Ramachandran is often called the tallest captive elephant in India, a claim that's hard to independently verify. What is beyond doubt is that he is 10.53ft (3.2m) tall, a majestic, imposing presence that looms large over his fellow pachyderms. Ramachandran, who is owned by the Thechikkottukavu temple trust in Thrissur district, is one among hundreds of captive elephants in Kerala that are leased out for temple festivals and other programmes.  He has thousands of admirers - a fan page on Facebook which regularly posts photos and updates has 122,000 followers - and draws huge crowds at events. But he is also notorious - critics says he displays violent tendencies and allege he has killed at least 13 people and two elephants over the past four decades. Thechikkottukavu temple officials, however, say that Ramachandran was not the direct cause of these deaths, which mostly occurred due to stampedes that broke out after he became agitated due to loud noises and other provocations at events. Animal rights activists say that Ramachandran, who is blind in his left eye, shouldn't be forced to participate in public events. ""He is the tallest and most handsome of elephants. It is a marvel to see him from close quarters. But his majestic look has also become a curse,"" says Sreedevi S Kartha, who works with welfare organisation People for Animals. Last week, 35 temple committees participated in an auction to bid for his presence at their festivals - Sree Vishwanatha Temple in Thrissur won by offering 675,000 rupees ($8,175; £6,759), a record bid. ""More people come to the temples when Ramachandran is present. That is why there is so much demand for him,"" says Bijoy PB, president of the Thechikkottukavu trust, adding that enthusiasm has picked up considerably after a lull in festivities due to the Covid pandemic. In 2019, temple authorities ran into trouble when two people died after Ramachandran went berserk when crackers were burst near him in a congested neighbourhood near the famous Guruvayur temple in Thrissur. Two people died in the stampede that ensued. The district administration then banned him from participating in the famous Thrissur Pooram temple festival, where Ramachandran sets off the festivities by symbolically pushing open the huge gates on the southern side of the Vadakkumnathan temple. But they were forced to lift the ban after festival organisers, elephant owners and Ramachandran's fans protested - the Kerala Elephants Owners Federation said they wouldn't provide any tuskers for temple festivals unless Ramachandran was allowed to participate. The elephant's health condition routinely makes headlines - last September, the Kerala high court banned Ramachandran from participating in programmes until a committee examined him. ""The committee was set up and it was decided to parade Ramachandran just twice a month. Subsequently, a government order permitted the elephant to participate in parades twice a week,"" says MN Jayachandran, an animal rights activist who moved the court on grounds of cruelty. He says the court also ordered four mahouts to be deployed around the elephant to ensure that he didn't come in contact with crowds. Mr Jayachandran argues that Ramachandran is not only blind in one eye, he is also losing vision in the other eye and getting older.  But the elephant's champions claim that he is healthy.  ""There is no problem with the other eye now. As per government rules, 65 years is the retirement age for elephants and Ramachandran is just 57,"" says Dr Giridas PB, Ramachandran's veterinarian and a member of the state's Animal Welfare Board. He also insists that Ramachandran hasn't harmed anyone. ""When people burst crackers or make noise, the elephant gets hassled,"" he says. Temple authorities also say too much is being made of the revenue Ramachandran brings in, and that a significant amount of this is spent on his maintenance, including food and his caretakers' salaries. ""In the last three years alone, we have spent close to two million rupees on his care, when we couldn't even earn from temple festivities due to Covid-19,"" says Bijoy from the Thechikkottukavu trust. But others argue that the elephant's rights are being violated. ""[Parading elephants] is nothing but torture to the animals under the guise of offering to the deity,"" says Dr Jacob Cheeran, a retired veterinarian.

Pakistan seeks IMF bailout to stave off economic collapse,"Pakistan is holding last-ditch talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to secure help to stem a deepening economic crisis that has all but emptied its foreign exchange reserves.  It has enough dollars to cover less than a month of imports at normal levels and is struggling to service sky-high levels of foreign debt.  An IMF team is due to leave the country on Thursday after 10 days of talks with the government aimed at unlocking vital international funds. In recent weeks, annual inflation soared to over 27%, its highest since 1975, and there are mounting fears for the economy in a pivotal election year.  This week the rupee sank to a historic low of 275 to the dollar, down from 175 a year ago, making it more expensive for Pakistan to buy and pay for things. The lack of foreign currency is one of the most pressing of Pakistan's problems. Factories like Jubilee Textiles in Faisalabad, the industrial heartland of Pakistan, were shut recently - not by the frequent power cuts that have dogged Pakistan for years, but because they couldn't get hold of dollars to pay for the goods they need. ""If we can't import, how can we manufacture? We've already made a loss,"" its manager Fahim told the BBC, adding that all its 300 workers had been sent home.  Jubilee's printing machines have only just restarted after shutting last month. Piles of white cotton sheets sat in iron tubs, covered by a light coat of brick dust, when the BBC visited, with the only sound the drip, drip of an industrial washer.  Walking through the network of frozen machines, Fahim said the factory had run out of the dyes they import from China, not because they weren't available, but because they say their bank wouldn't clear the dollars to pay for them for weeks.  According to analysts, the government had been holding the bank's exchange rate artificially high behind the scenes which was contributing to the lack of dollars in the system. At the end of last month, they allowed it to drop, which could help some businesses, but also push prices up.   Businesses and industries across Pakistan said they have had to slow or stop work while they also wait for goods they have imported that are currently stacking up in ports.  In late January, a government minister told the BBC that there were more than 8,000 containers piled up in Karachi's two ports, containing goods from medicine to food. Some of that has started to clear, according to local media reports, but much is still stuck.  Pakistan, like many countries, is suffering as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, following which global fuel prices have soared. Pakistan relies heavily on imported fossil fuels and importing food has also become more expensive.  If the rupee depreciates, fuel costs more, with knock-on effects for goods that are transported or manufactured. The government recently increased fuel prices by over 13% but says it's not planning any more.  Add to this the cost of last year's floods, which the UN says caused damage of more than $16bn. Huge areas of Pakistan were submerged, destroying farmland and disrupting its ability to produce food. Basics like wheat and onions have skyrocketed in price.   All this comes in an uncertain and febrile political climate - an election is due by the end of the year. As for bailouts, Pakistan is no stranger to them. The country - which has a massive military budget and years of debt-driven infrastructure spending - has long failed to wean itself off populist subsides and stabilise its economy.    ""If you see the history of Pakistan, we have a cycle of balance of payments problems,"" says Dr Sajid Amin Javed, deputy executive director at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute in Islamabad.  ""We go to the IMF. We implement very strict reforms, for two or three years, then it's an election year and unfortunately, we reverse them all.""  Subsidies have long been used to woo voters in Pakistan, he says.  Imran Khan, who was ousted as Pakistan's prime minister last April, came to power in 2018 promising to fix the economy. At the time he had vowed not to seek help from the IMF, but inflation soared and the rupee dropped.  He ended up negotiating a $6bn rescue bailout with the IMF to address the balance of payments crisis.  The current negotiations are over the next $1.1bn tranche of this. It was originally due to be made in November, but talks have repeatedly stalled.  The government and Mr Khan's party, the PTI, have had their own disagreements with the IMF in the past, but with the country's foreign reserves now so low both agree Pakistan needs to come to an agreement to secure the funds.  The negotiations have been difficult, according to Pakistan; last week Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the organisation had given Pakistan's finance minister a tough time.  In an interview last month Mr Khan warned that Pakistan could follow in the footsteps of Sri Lanka, which ran out of money to buy food, fuel and other essentials last year, causing a popular uprising that unseated the president.  The comparison doesn't hold for Dr Javed.  ""The size of the economy is absolutely different, number one,"" he says. ""Pakistan has always had good support from friendly countries, such as China, UAE, Saudi Arabia - and in turbulent times that's come in the form of rollovers, refinancing, friendly deposits and delayed oil repayments."" However, he does have his concerns.  ""The common ground that we do have is political instability and our ability to navigate that will be crucial in coming out of this crisis."" The current government and Mr Khan's party, the PTI, have no love lost between them. Mr Khan, who still has considerable support, has been holding rallies and marches, claiming his removal from office under the constitution was unfair.  Pakistan's new government says it won't accede to his demands for an early election and argues it's putting the economy first. ""For one person's personal interest we cannot put the whole country into limbo,"" planning minister Ahsan Iqbal told the BBC.  ""Calling an election at this time means there will be four to five months of uncertainty.""  That's one thing both sides agree on: economic stability is difficult when there is no political certainty, and while an election looms that is unlikely to happen.  So, could the situation get better for Pakistan? Put simply, the country needs more dollars and it needs them soon, not least to keep the lights on.  As the weather gets warmer and people use more electricity to power fans and air conditioning, the need for energy will go up putting more strain on the system - and more pressure on Pakistan's almost exhausted foreign reserves. The question is, how long would a bailout deal buy the country this time? ""If the IMF programme resumption is successful, that also unlocks billions of dollars promised by Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Then the risk of a larger balance of payments problem will be pushed down the road,"" says Khurram Hussain, a business and economic journalist in Pakistan.  But he adds: ""In the long term the programme will have little to no impact. Pakistan faces a crushing debt burden. Without comprehensive debt restructuring, the country will keep landing up back at this spot, at the edge of a balance of payments crisis.""  Trying to get a deal could mean painful political promises, potentially including dropping subsidies on energy.  Mr Hussain says coming to a deal with the IMF will help the economy and the state, but at the expense of normal people. However, he thinks that the biggest risk is that the government comes to an agreement with the IMF, starts implementing the plans, then changes its mind.  ""If the government gets cold feet and asks to halt the process of adjustment and tries to renegotiate again, Pakistan will swivel back firmly into where it is facing a balance of payments crisis.""

"Bristol man loses £8,000 in banking app scam","A business owner is warning others of the dangers of bank fraud, after he was scammed out of almost £8,000. Marcus Gear said the caller was so convincing he was persuaded to use his banking app to hand over all the money he was relying on for his business. ""I had complete trust in this person. He was, in my eyes, controlling the app,"" said Mr Gear. His bank, Starling, said he was wrong to give out a code found in the app, but eventually refunded the money. In September 2022, Mr Gear, who owns an events company in Bristol, received a call from what he thought was his bank, telling him they suspected fraudulent transactions were being made on his account.  They said they would push the payments through the app for him to reject. ""One by one he told me the amount, to the penny, that was going to pop up on my phone,"" he explained. Mr Gear was then instructed to reject six more payments before he was told he would be helped to close his account and transfer all his money to a new one.  The caller asked him for a one-time payment code found in his app to approve the transfer. £7,950 then left his account, leaving about £200. Starling Bank said customers receive ""fraud warnings and guidance throughout the app"", including a message that it would ""never ask customers to share a one-time payment code"". A spokesperson said they could tell Mr Gear had acknowledged previous warnings.  ""I felt like an idiot. But when it's your money on the line and it's happening at the time, some thought goes out the window and you think 'this person is trying to protect my money',"" he said. It is thought the fraudsters already had Mr Gear's bank details, and by creating payment alerts they gained his trust, persuading him to hand over the code. Since speaking out on social media he found the same scam had happened to several people he knew, including another Starling customer. The bank said Mr Gear was a victim of authorised push payment (APP) fraud. ""Starling works extremely hard to protect its customers from this type of fraud,"" said the spokesperson, adding that they initially did not refund Mr Gear because he shared the one-time passcode. UK Finance, the body that represents banks, said the industry was ""tackling fraud on every front"". A spokesperson said anyone who thinks they may have fallen for a scam must contact their bank immediately and report it to Action Fraud. Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

"Scotland's papers: 'Now give me your jets', A9 dualling 'betrayal'",,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-64577311
Corseford College: The campus supporting people with complex needs,"Scotland's first further education facility for young people with complex support needs welcomed its first students in September last year. BBC Scotland has spent time with its students and staff to see what kind of impact it has made. Corseford College - in Johnstone, Renfrewshire - provides individual support for 15 teenagers to continue their education beyond school. Before now, students had to travel to England to attend similar facilities. The college offers subjects including literacy, numeracy, life skills and tech skills. The campus also has sensory rooms and a hydrotherapy pool. Jamie Thomson is one of its first students. When the 18-year-old left school last year, he faced an uncertain future - would he be able to keep learning or would he be spending time in an adult day centre with people much older than him? Jamie has complex support needs. Autism, learning difficulties, asthma and a heart condition mean that he would not receive adequate support in a mainstream college. He had few options until his parents enrolled him for the newly-announced Corseford College. Attached to an existing grant-funded independent school for children with additional needs, the college is the first of its kind in Scotland. Jamie has been attending since September.  His mum Sarah said he receives literacy and numeracy classes at the college, alongside music training. She said her son appears calmer and is interacting with students his own age. Before Jamie was accepted at college, his likely destination would be day centres in the city. ""Jamie wouldn't be able to manage in a mainstream college because he has no sense of danger - he has to be watched 24-7,"" said Sarah. ""At Corseford, he has a lot of one-to-one interaction. They make a timetable that suits the individual. ""It is giving him a lot of opportunities that he'd never have at a day care centre."" Corseford College is in a refurbished wing of the charity Capability Scotland's existing school campus. The Scottish government and the Scottish Funding Council has pledged £316,000 to the facility in its first year.  Capability Scotland is also investing an extra £250,000 in creating a ""pioneering"", ""state-of-the-art"" campus. Liz McConnachie, head of Corseford College, has worked in the sector for 35 years. Asked why such a service has not been available before, she said: ""There isn't enough noise made about it. ""It was the one piece of education in Scotland that was not accommodated. The only thing that was not in place was for our prospective students with complex needs leaving school. ""There was nothing for them but day care. If you see the students, they are capable of learning but it's the one area of Scottish education that is not accommodated for - until now."" Capability Scotland said the college is the first of a planned series of campuses that ""will fill the nationwide void in further education opportunities for those whose needs cannot be met in mainstream further education colleges"". In the last five years, 51 young people with complex needs had to travel to England to get access to similar facilities. Jamie Hepburn, the Scottish government's minister for further education, attended a launch event for the college this week. He told the BBC he wanted a facility like Corseford in Scotland to avoid people travelling elsewhere. He said: ""The specific proposition that we have here hadn't been advanced to the stage where it was put before government and we were in a position to say, yes, that is something we want to support. ""But Capability Scotland spoke with me, made that proposition and I was delighted to be able to support it."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-64576957
Access fears over Copmanthorpe level crossing replacement,"Network Rail has said replacing a level crossing near York with a fully accessible bridge would cost an additional £3m to £5m. It comes after concerns were raised that replacing Beckett's Crossing, at Copmanthorpe, with a stepped bridge would limit access to the countryside. Parish councillors want to see a fully-accessible bridge, but Network Rail said its plan is appropriate. The final decision will be made by the government later this year. The work is part of the Transpennine route upgrade, which will see more frequent trains on the line, travelling across four tracks at speeds of up to 125mph (201km/h). The proposed bridge would be 25 ft (8.3 m) high and have 90 steps, and Copmanthorpe parish council has urged Network Rail to consider a ramped design to ensure disabled access. However, Network Rail said the route, which is part of the Ebor Way walking route, was not used by anyone with reduced mobility and the additional costs of an accessible bridge were not needed. Phil Bates, from the company, said: ""We've done a great deal of work to look at who uses the level crossing and have designed a solution that meets their needs, makes the best use of taxpayers money and makes sense for this location with poor current accessibility."" According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, the City of York Council rejected Network Rail's application to divert the public right of way via the proposed stepped bridge over concerns about access last year. Campaigners also say it could hinder future plans for active travel routes between Copmanthorpe and neighbouring Bishopthorpe. The parish council's chairman Robert West said they hoped to enlist support from the city council and local MPs to lobby the government. He said that would ""ensure that Network Rail provides a new safer crossing that is accessible to all those currently using the crossing and the many more wishing to use the crossing in the future to access an improved road-free link to Bishopthorpe.""

Stormont: NI secretary to spell out plans on election delay,"The Northern Ireland secretary will spell out plans to delay the requirement to call an assembly election when he meets Stormont's five largest parties on Thursday.  Round table talks will take place at the government's offices in Belfast. It is understood Chris Heaton-Harris has also asked parties to bring proposals for the budget for 2023-24. The government aims to bring forward legislation to push back the current deadline for a poll on 13 April. Mr Heaton-Harris has been under a legal duty to call a fresh assembly election since mid-January after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) failed to end its boycott of the Northern Ireland Executive.  The party withdrew its First Minister Paul Givan from the executive in February 2021 and has not returned. That also meant it fell to Mr Heaton-Harris to set a budget for the current financial year, which ends next month. Last week came a warning that public services provided by Northern Ireland Executive departments face cuts of at least £500m in 2023/24. If an executive is not reformed, it will be up to Mr Heaton-Harris to explore options and assess what efficiencies can be made. Ahead of Thursday's talks, government officials have also asked the parties to provide feedback on the current budget, as well as decisions that have been taken by civil servants running Stormont's nine departments in the absence of minsters. The previous session of round table talks led by Mr Heaton-Harris caused controversy after Sinn Féin said it would not attend, because its leader Mary Lou McDonald had been told she could not take part. She sits as a TD (MP) in the Dáil (lower house of Ireland's parliament) where she is leader of the opposition.  At the time the UK government said diplomatic protocol meant Foreign Secretary James Cleverly could not meet her before meeting a member of the Irish government.  At the time, Mr Cleverly denied anyone had been excluded and said the party's deputy leader, Michelle O'Neill, was invited and ""chose not to come"". Ms O'Neill and Ms McDonald are both expected to attend Thursday's discussions with the Northern Ireland secretary. Representatives from the DUP, Alliance, Ulster Unionist Party and Social Democratic and Labour Party are also set to take part. Mr Heaton-Harris is also expected to provide parties with an update on the negotiations over the Northern Ireland Protocol. On Wednesday, he flew to Brussels for a meeting with EU chief negotiator Maros Sefcovic. Speculation is mounting that the UK and EU could be inching towards agreement on a deal.

Melksham Community Larder tries to tackle food waste,"A community project is redistributing fresh food in an effort to reduce waste. Melksham's Community Larder is involved in a mission by Wiltshire Wildlife Trust to limit the amount of food people throw away. It's urging people to take part in its Waste Free February challenge. Adrienne Westbrook, a volunteer at the community larder, said: ""I hate throwing out food when people are hungry."" The aim of the challenge, which is now in its sixth year, is to get people to look at the rubbish they're producing and limit it by reusing, recycling and composting more. The Trust says its challenge saw more than 400 people save six tonnes of rubbish last year. Jessica Thimbleby, Carbon Reduction Champion at Wiltshire Wildlife Trust, said: ""There's 218,000 tonnes of rubbish in Wiltshire goes to waste each year.  ""By all of us making small changes and not throwing food away, for example, we can help reduce that and make a difference.  ""All that food is just being thrown away, which is why projects like this are fantastic.  ""It's helping people access free food, there's no charge, it's stopping that food from going to waste."" The Trust has teamed up with Melksham Community Larder, which aims to save fresh food that can no longer be sold and make it available for locals to collect. It's run by 10 volunteers out of the Roundhouse in Melksham. Adrienne Westbrook said: ""I hate the thought of anybody not being able to buy the food they need for their children and the food they need for themselves.  ""One of the frustrations I have is supermarkets that send their excess food out of a town when it could be used by volunteers to help solve the food poverty issue."" Kody, an ambassador for Wiltshire Wildlife Trust, added: ""Waste on its own has a massive environmental footprint.  ""But I think a lot of people don't appreciate that when it leaves your hands it continues its environmental footprint.  ""So when that goes to landfill it's going to degrade, that's going to produce harmful gasses. ""I also think this month's important in that by choosing more sustainable products you're sending a message to businesses."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-64574252
Turkey earthquake: Where did it hit and why was it so deadly?,"More than 11,000 people have been killed and thousands injured by a huge earthquake which struck south-eastern Turkey, near the Syrian border, in the early hours of Monday morning. The earthquake, which hit near the town of Gaziantep, was closely followed by numerous aftershocks - including one quake which was almost as large as the first. The death toll is expected to keep rising.  The first earthquake was big - it registered as 7.8, classified as ""major"" on the official magnitude scale. It broke along about 100km (62 miles) of fault line, causing serious damage to buildings near the fault.  Prof Joanna Faure Walker, head of the Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction at University College London, said: ""Of the deadliest earthquakes in any given year, only two in the last 10 years have been of equivalent magnitude, and four in the previous 10 years."" But it is not only the power of the tremor that causes devastation.  This incident occurred in the early hours of the morning, when people were inside and sleeping.  The sturdiness of the buildings is also a factor. Dr Carmen Solana, reader in volcanology and risk communication at the University of Portsmouth, says: ""The resistant infrastructure is unfortunately patchy in South Turkey and especially Syria, so saving lives now mostly relies on response. The next 24 hours are crucial to find survivors. After 48 hours the number of survivors decreases enormously."" This was a region where there had not been a major earthquake for more than 200 years or any warning signs, so the level of preparedness would be less than for a region which was more used to dealing with tremors. The Earth's crust is made up of separate bits, called plates, that nestle alongside each other.  These plates often try to move but are prevented by the friction of rubbing up against an adjoining one. But sometimes the pressure builds until one plate suddenly jerks across, causing the surface to move. In this case it was the Arabian plate moving northwards and grinding against the Anatolian plate. Friction from the plates has been responsible for very damaging earthquakes in the past.  On 13 August 1822 it caused an earthquake registering 7.4 in magnitude, significantly less than the 7.8 magnitude recorded on Monday. Even so, the 19th Century earthquake resulted in immense damage to towns in the area, with 7,000 deaths recorded in the city of Aleppo alone. Damaging aftershocks continued for nearly a year. There have already been several aftershocks following the current earthquake and scientists are expecting it to follow the same trend as the previous big one in the region. They are measured on a scale called the Moment Magnitude Scale (Mw). This has replaced the better known Richter scale, now considered outdated and less accurate. The number attributed to an earthquake represents a combination of the distance the fault line has moved and the force that moved it . A tremor of 2.5 or less usually cannot be felt, but can be detected by instruments. Quakes of up to five are felt and cause minor damage. The Turkish earthquake at 7.8 is classified as major and usually causes serious damage, as it has in this instance.  Anything above 8 causes catastrophic damage and can totally destroy communities at its centre. On 26 December 2004, one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded struck off the coast of Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that swept away entire communities around the Indian Ocean.  The 9.1 magnitude quake killed about 228,000 people. Another earthquake - off the coast of Japan in 2011 - registered as magnitude 9 and caused widespread damage on the land, and caused a tsunami. It led to a major accident at the Fukushima nuclear plant along the coast. The largest ever earthquake registered 9.5, and was recorded in Chile in 1960.

Hillview: Hospital exposed over mental health care for women,"A teenage girl who was left ""traumatised"" at a private mental hospital says she is relieved it will no longer be treating young women. The former patient said she still has nightmares about her time at Hillview Hospital in Ebbw Vale, Blaenau Gwent. In July, former operator Regis Healthcare denied all allegations and said it was one of the UK's most ""successful services"".  The Welsh government said it had spent an extra £50m on supporting services. Hillview Hospital is an independent hospital registered to provide mental health services to women and girls aged between 13 and 18. The teenager, who we cannot identify, was detained at the hospital under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act. At the time, Regis Healthcare were the hospital's operators. Two BBC Wales investigations exposed excessive use of restraints and poor practice. New operators Elysium Healthcare, which took over in September, said it now wanted to provide a new adult mental health service at the centre. The teenager said she would be restrained by three to five members of staff without any attempts to calm her down first. In one week, she was restrained 17 times and seven of those were for two hours or more. In the latest inspection report, the eleventh since 2018, Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) said the hospital was still a service of concern. Elysium Healthcare said it had started the process of moving the current group of young patients out of the hospital so they can attend services closer to home and aim to complete the process by March.  The teenager said it is ""good news"" that it will no longer be a child and adolescent mental health unit. ""It's about time. I still have nightmares that I'm back there so I don't have closure,"" she said.  ""It's good because no other young women will go through what I did, but the damage to me has already been done. ""I had trauma and it felt like they were 're-doing' the trauma I'd been through. They didn't listen to me, my voice was taken away from me. ""If I'd received help then my problems would have been fixed but I'm worse having been there - I picked up bad behaviours, like self-harming and getting an eating disorder."" In July, Regis Healthcare said it ""refuted"" all the allegations but was unable to comment on specific cases due to client confidentiality and being involved in a legal dispute. It said it welcomed visits from HIW and NHS and recognised the importance of receiving guidance on areas it was doing ""really well"" in areas like rapport between staff and patients as well as training.  In a statement it said it is willing to take action when given constructive feedback and that an improvement plan which provided the inspectorate with ""sufficient assurance"" is being made to ensure patient safety.  The hospital had been commended and awarded the highest level of the quality standards rating system following a NHS Wales quality assurance audit, it added. Current owners Elysium Healthcare said: ""Hillview remains a much-needed mental health hospital for Wales and we will move to provide a new service for adults from Wales. ""The new provision will be agreed in consultation with NHS Wales and its key stakeholders. We have started these discussions and look forward to sharing plans and proposals in due course."" Plaid Cymru MS Sioned Williams, a member of the Children, Young People and Education Committee, said that she was concerned about the lack of capacity in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) from early intervention onwards and said it was ""one of the most urgent issues we need to address in Wales"". ""We know that mental health problems among young women are increasing.  ""There is an epidemic of mental health problems. We've heard evidence of this scarring people's lives. We need more steps aimed at early intervention and also we need to make sure this type of accommodation is available locally and that it is the right type of accommodation,"" she said. The Welsh government said that protecting young people's mental health was an ""absolute priority"" and that it continued to work with partners to ensure there was a wide range of effective support. ""We continue to invest in a whole system approach to supporting children and young people's mental health and wellbeing. ""The Welsh Health Specialist Services Committee will publish a five to 10 year strategy setting out sustainable long term improvements to specialist mental health services in the coming months.""

Menopause passport introduced by NHS trust boosting wellbeing,"Staff taking part in a ""menopause passport"" scheme say it has increased confidence and had an impact on emotional wellbeing. The initiative at University Hospitals Birmingham is thought to be the first of its kind in the NHS. The personalised passport allows women to indicate when they are in need of more support at work.  Nurse Wendy Madden, whose menopause symptoms led to her taking 11 weeks off work, came up with the idea.  Adjustments could include taking more breaks, working different shifts or sitting closer to the toilets and air conditioning. ""What we're doing is individualising that person's individual menopause journey and what support they need at different stages of their journey,"" said Ms Madden. Gina Ross, a hospital porter, said she had experienced hot flushes, sleepless nights and bouts of depression for the past year.  She is also one of an estimated three million women who experience menopause while working. ""In the beginning I didn't want to come to work,"" she said.  She also described feelings of embarrassment after suffering memory loss. ""I thought: 'Oh my god, what's happening to me'?""  However, she added attending a support group had helped. University Hospitals Birmingham is one of the biggest hospital trusts in England and employs more than 18,000 women, with about 5,000 of them aged 50 or over. Alongside the passport, a group of menopause champions have been appointed across the trust, acting as points of contact for people who want to better understand the condition. One, Corrine Baylis, said her interventions had had an impact on the staff's emotional wellbeing at work.  Last month ministers rejected a proposal from a committee of MPs to introduce ""menopause leave"" pilots in England, arguing it could be ""counterproductive"". However, the government said it had an ""ambitious"" plan to improve support.  A group of menopause champions have been assigned across the West Midlands NHS trust as points of contact for any staff members who are struggling or keen to learn more.  Debs Wallbank, from Much Wenlock in Shropshire, became a menopause coach after experiencing six years of undiagnosed symptoms, including anxiety, leading her to leave several jobs.   ""It's not about labelling women,"" she said, ""it's about raising the awareness, so that people are more compassionate and can make small adjustments that don't have to even cost any money.""

Ukraine war: Elon Musk's SpaceX firm bars Kyiv from using Starlink tech for drone control,"SpaceX has limited Ukraine's ability to use its satellite internet service for military purposes - after reports that Kyiv has used it to control drones. Early in the war, Ukraine was given thousands of SpaceX Starlink dishes - which connect to satellites and help people stay connected to the internet.   But it is also said to have used the tech to target Russian positions with drones - which SpaceX says goes against the service agreement. Ukraine is yet to comment on the move. The Starlink technology was ""never meant to be weaponised,"" SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell said at an event in Washington DC on Wednesday. She made reference to Ukraine's alleged use of Starlink to control drones, and stressed that the equipment had been provided for humanitarian use. Unmanned aircraft have played an important role in the war, having been used by Kyiv to search out Russian troops, drop bombs and counter Moscow's own drone attacks. Russia has also been accused of attempting to jam Starlink signals by SpaceX founder Elon Musk. Ms Shotwell confirmed that it was acceptable for the Ukrainian military for deploy Starlink technology ""for comms"", but said her intent was ""never to have them use it for offensive purposes"". She said the company had taken steps to ""limit"" the abilities of the Ukrainian armed forces to use Starlink in an offensive way - without giving further details.  The executive said she could not answer a question on whether these efforts were the cause of outages to the Starlink service late last year.  After invading its neighbour in February last year, Russia quickly looked to close down local internet services and to block social media. The first Starlink dishes - or terminals - were provided to Ukraine soon after, in an effort to ensure people stayed connected. They work by connecting to satellites in low-Earth orbit. As well as the terminals sent directly by the company itself, others have been funded by the foreign governments. In October, Mr Musk signalled that he could not continue funding Starlink in Ukraine, before rapidly reversing his position. In a tweet last week, the billionaire again addressed the issue and acknowledged that there was a dilemma at work.  ""SpaceX Starlink has become the connectivity backbone of Ukraine all the way up to the front lines. This is the damned if you do part,"" he wrote.  ""However, we are not allowing Starlink to be used for long-range drone strikes. This is the damned if you don't part.""  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64579267
Center Parcs pull out of Crawley development plans,"Center Parcs has announced it will not go ahead with plans to develop a new forest holiday village in West Sussex.

Center Parcs CEO Colin McKinlay said the company was committed to improving the biodiversity of its sites. ""Whilst it is obviously disappointing that we will not be able to bring Center Parcs to this part of West Sussex, this decision demonstrates how seriously we take our responsibility to the environment, as well as our ongoing commitment to enhancing the natural habitats in which our villages are located,"" he said.

Labour MP Alex Davies-Jones apologises for 'minor' lobbying rules breach,"Labour Pontypridd MP Alex Davies-Jones has apologised for a ""minor and inadvertent"" breach of lobbying rules. The shadow culture minister asked a Commons question about the British Council the day after returning from a trip to Japan funded by the body. In correspondence with Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Daniel Greenberg she accepted the error. The Commons Standards Committee has recommended that Ms Davies-Jones should face no further action. MPs who receive a payment or other benefits such as hospitality or gifts must not use their position in Parliament to benefit the company which gave it to them. She told Mr Greenberg it was ""an inadvertent breach, and one which I am extremely apologetic for"". The committee's report said: ""This was a minor and inadvertent breach of the code. Ms Davies-Jones has apologised to the commissioner for breaching the rules."" The MP received a trip to Tokyo valued at nearly £3,000 paid for by the British Council last autumn. On 8 November, the day after returning, she brought up the trip in the House of Commons, praising the organisation's ""brilliant work"" in ""educating people in our English language and using our arts and culture for the greatest good"". She asked Foreign Office minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan: ""What more can the government do to support the British Council, not just in Japan, but across the world?"" Ms Davies-Jones referred herself to the commissioner for investigation and was found to have breached the MPs' code of conduct rules on paid advocacy. The Standards Committee noted that, from 1 March, visits funded by the British Council, which promotes British culture overseas, would not need to be registered. ""In our view, Ms Davies-Jones would not have been in breach of the code had she taken the same course of action after March 1 2023,"" the committee said ""In view of this, we recommend no further action be taken.""

Ukraine: No immediate transfer of UK fighter jets - Wallace,"There will be no immediate transfer of UK fighter jets to Ukraine, the defence secretary has said. Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky renewed his call for fighter jets during a visit to the UK on Wednesday - his first since the Russian invasion. Ben Wallace told the BBC that supplying aircraft to use in the conflict would potentially take months.  The defence secretary said the UK was instead focused on using alternative provision of air cover to Ukraine. Speaking at a conference in Rome, Mr Wallace said air support and supporting moving troops could be achieved by using long-range missiles and drones. He said it was ""more realistic and more productive"" to envisage the UK providing Ukraine with aircraft in the long term to ensure its security after the war with Russia has ended. ""This is not a simple case of towing an aircraft to the border,"" Mr Wallace told the BBC. ""Britain knows what Ukraine needs and is very happy to help in many ways trying to achieve the effect. ""Those same effects can be done, but potentially through a different way - and without taking months, which of course gifting fighter jets would take,"" he said. Mr Wallace said he had a duty to ensure the UK and Nato had the aircraft needed for their own defence. He also dismissed suggestions made by former prime minister Boris Johnson that the UK could provide 100 Typhoon warplanes. Typhoons are made by a coalition of different countries and their permission would be needed before sending them on to Ukraine, he said.  He added that the Typhoons which would most likely be supplied are only equipped for air to air combat, and not suitable for ground attack. President Zelensky addressed the European Parliament in Brussels on Thursday morning and is expected to ask EU leaders for more weaponry and fighter jets later. Earlier this year, the UK announced it would send 14 battle tanks to Ukraine.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64578973

Three hundred jobs to go at publisher DC Thomson,"About 300 staff at DC Thomson will be made redundant, sources within the company have been told. It emerged on Wednesday that jobs would be lost at the media company as they tried to plug a £10m gap by ""reshaping its portfolio"". The largest number of jobs will be lost in the company's magazine sector with numerous titles closing. Around half of the redundancies will come from Aceville in Colchester, a magazine publisher acquired in 2018. Scottish-based magazine titles are also affected as are staff at DC Thomson's newspapers which include The Courier, The Press and Journal and The Sunday Post.  Staff were told their jobs were at risk in a series of meetings on Wednesday before being told the number of redundancies on Thursday morning.  Titles understood to be closing are Animal Planet Kids, Living, Animals and You, teen magazine Shout and Platinum, a title for women which was only launched in 2019. Staff have been told that news titles will not close.  Sources within DC Thomson described the atmosphere within the newsroom as ""grim"". Senior editors are believed to have been angered by the handling of staff redundancies, having not been consulted on plans to axe jobs.  The editor-in-chief of the Press & Journal and Evening Express in Aberdeen, Frank O'Donnell, has been told his job is ""at risk"".  It is understood jobs at risk within the company's newspaper staff include journalists, photographers, senior management and editors.  DC Thomson also produces magazines and comics including The People's Friend, Beano, and Puzzler. It has offices across Scotland, including in Dundee, Aberdeen and Glasgow, alongside operations in Colchester and London. A further update is expected from the company in the coming hours. On Thursday, Rebecca Miskin, chief executive of DC Thomson's media business, said ""significant changes"" were being announced. ""We will be announcing the closure of some well-loved titles, as well as the cessation of some commercial activities,"" she said. ""This will mean losing some valued colleagues, something we deeply regret. ""These moves are vital to set us up to thrive in the future and to respond to the difficult economic environment we are in. ""Until discussions have taken place with colleagues, we aren't able to comment on the number of people or the titles which will be impacted."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-64581579

Ambulance response times improve by one hour,"Ambulance crews reached emergencies such as heart attacks and strokes one hour quicker in January than they did in December in England, figures show. It took 32 minutes on average, compared to over 90 minutes the month before. That is the best performance for 19 months, but still short of the target of 18 minutes. A&E waits also improved, with just over a quarter of patients waiting longer than four hours, down from more than a third in December. The improvement comes as rates of flu and Covid hospital admissions have started falling since the turn of the year. Dr Tim Cooksley, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said despite the improvement the situation was still ""intolerable"". He pointed to the waits the sickest and most frail were facing when they needed to be found a bed on a ward. Nearly four in 10 patients waited over four hours on trolleys and in corridors. ""The fundamental problem remains a significant shortage of workforce leading to woefully inadequate inpatient bed and social care capacity,"" he added. NHS England's national medical director Prof Sir Stephen Powis said the improvement was pleasing and praised staff for working ""flat out"" during winter. But he warned that the ongoing strike action would ""inevitably"" impact on the progress being made on waits for planned hospital care such as knee and hip replacements. The figures showed the waiting list rose slightly to 7.2 million by the end of December, with the number of 18-month waiters increasing by 12% to nearly 56,000. Tens of thousands of planned hospital operations and appointments have had to be cancelled because of strike action. Walkouts by ambulance staff and nurses this week led to more than 40,000 bookings having to be rescheduled. Since industrial action began back in December more than 100,000 patients have been affected. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-64580956
Succession talk arises after Kim Jong-Un's daughter makes appearance,"On Wednesday night lines of monster missiles rolled through the North Korean capital Pyongyang. But it was not just his weapons that Kim Jong-Un was parading. On show too, was his daughter.   As the North Korean leader took up his usual parade position, at the centre of the balcony, he was joined, unusually, by the young girl dressed in black.    She is thought to be his second oldest child, called Kim Ju-ae, aged around 10 years of age.  This is the fifth public appearance she has made, and all in less than three months.   During this short time she has undergone a remarkable transformation, making it increasingly likely she has been chosen as the future leader of North Korea.  When she first appeared, back in November of last year, at the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), speculation was rife. Many whispered: Would this girl one day lead the world's most secretive state?  But at the time it was far too big a leap to make.   Wearing a white puffer jacket, with red ballet pumps and a ponytail, clutching her father's hand, she appeared so young. Perhaps Mr Kim just wanted to portray himself as a good father or make crystal clear his family, with all its weapons, was here to stay.  But with each appearance the young Kim appears to have grown in stature.   On Tuesday night, ahead of the parade, she attended a banquet for North Korea's top military officials. This time she dressed in a demure white shirt and black buttoned-up skirt suit, with her hair clipped back. The photographs were jaw-dropping for many a North Korean watcher. In each picture she takes centre-stage, sitting between her mother and father, and surrounded by military officials.   Another intriguing development has been the language used to describe the young Ms Kim.  She was first introduced in state media as Kim Jong-Un's ""beloved"" daughter. By Tuesday's military banquet she had been elevated to the status of ""respected"" daughter. It is an adjective reserved for only the most revered. Only after Kim Jong-Un's status as future leader was cemented, was he referred to as ""respected comrade"".  Since its foundation, North Korea has been ruled by three generations of the Kim family. Its citizens are told that the family hails from a sacred bloodline, meaning only they can lead the country. Kim Jong-Un will want to ensure he passes the mantle down to the fourth generation.   But even if Ms Ju-ae is the intended heir, why introduce her so early, and at such speed? Kim Jong-Un is only 39 - his daughter still a child.   Mr Kim was reportedly revealed as the successor to his father Kim Jong-Il when he was eight years old, but only in private to military leaders.  Publicly, it was only made clear about a year before his father died. This gave him a rocky start to the job, as he worked ruthlessly to consolidate power.  Perhaps he is trying to give his daughter an easier ride, by ensuring her position is more established by the time she takes over. Perhaps his health is not in great shape, and he does not have as long as we think. Both, of course, are impossible to know.  Another reason Kim Jong-Un may need so much time, is to overcome the prejudices of what is a deeply patriarchal society. North Korea has never been led by a woman, despite having some women in high places - Kim's sister Kim Yo-Jong is the most prominent example.   James Fretwell, an analyst for the North Korean monitoring platform NK News, does not think this is insurmountable.   ""While North Korea is a male-dominated society, it's also a Kim-dominated society,"" he told the BBC. ""More than anything, her bloodline will make her potential leadership candidate. It would be more surprising if someone outside of the ruling Kim family - male or female - managed to take the top spot.""  That said, to install a woman at the very top will require work if she is to be truly accepted by the people, the military, and the elite.  Kim Ju-Ae's place as the next leader of North Korea is far from guaranteed, but with each appearance she makes, it certainly seems more plausible.

Turkey earthquake: One ruined neighbourhood at the centre of the devastation,"Monday's double earthquake in Turkey and Syria caused devastation across the region, killing thousands and destroying buildings and neighbourhoods in dozens on cities. In Kahramanmaras, which was near the epicentre of both quakes, aerial photographs reveal the extent of the damage caused in just one of those neighbourhoods. The image is dominated by the tent city that has been set up in the city's 12 Subat stadium - usually the home of Kahramanmarasspor football club - but now filled with about 200 tents, each capable of sheltering a family or even two. The large Gazi middle school near the stadium is still standing but looks badly damaged - two neighbouring residential tower blocks, next to the school, were completely collapsed. On a normal Monday, some 2,000 students would have been attending lessons at Gazi middle school. But schools across the country were closed until 13 February after the first quake struck before dawn on Monday. ​​It is as you round the corner of Kuddusi Baba Boulevard and into the usually busy shopping street of Azerbaijan Boulevard that the full scale of destruction begins to unfold. Before Monday the street was full of shops and cafes, many with several storeys of apartments above them, but all that is left now is rubble.  And looking back towards the stadium over the ruined the apartment blocks you can see the private Sular hospital - damaged but still standing - although the four-star Sahra hotel next door was among the flattened buildings. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited the tent city in the stadium on Wednesday where he met survivors and defended the state's response amid criticism it had been too slow. He acknowledged there had been ""issues at airports and on the roads"" but insisted the situation was improving, adding: ""We have mobilised all our resources. The state is doing its job."" It's not known how many have died in the city but on Tuesday evening officials said more than 1,200 people had died in the province - the death toll nationally has more than trebled to almost 13,000 since that last province-by-province update. Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) says it has sent more than 140,000 tents and 1.2m blankets to the 10 provinces worst hit by the disaster. An estimated 2,000 people could be sheltering in the 12 Subat stadium but tens of thousands more have been left homeless across Turkey and neighbouring Syria.

Turkey-Syria earthquake: Watching the search for family on Zoom,"Outside a small community centre in Enfield, north London, Lutfi Erguven is intently watching something on his phone.  On the small screen, rescuers can be seen digging through rubble. They're looking for people trapped in wreckage in Mr Erguven's home town in southern Turkey. A series of earthquakes hit southern Turkey and northern Syria on Monday morning, killing more than 15,000 people - a death toll that is expected to rise.  He isn't watching a clip from a news bulletin, Mr Erguven tells BBC News - it's a Zoom call. Rescue teams are sharing their efforts in a video call so that Turkish people in the UK and elsewhere can join the search for their loved ones remotely. Mr Erguven has given them the name of his cousin. He hopes that they find him alive.  ""They haven't found my cousin yet, but they've found other people,"" he says. ""That's good news for us as well.""  Mr Erguven explains that he has travelled from his home in Edinburgh down to London to join others from his community in person. While there are Turkish communities across the UK, the vast majority live in north London. Mr Erguven is also Alevi, a minority religion that is prevalent in the worst-hit areas of southern Turkey.  The Zoom link, he says, has been shared in Turkish WhatsApp groups. Dozens of people have been joining in the hopes of finding out their loved ones are safe. In normal times, the British Alevi Federation centre focuses on more light-hearted community activities, such as Turkish music classes and beginners' cycling courses for adult women. But now it has arranged an emergency relief trip, with a small group of people flying into the country before driving long-distance to badly affected areas. They're also transporting large containers full of blankets, heaters, and toiletries. Atescan Ates, a second-year law student, tells BBC News that, as soon as they heard about the disaster, he and other younger people immediately used social media to organise donations. ""A lot of us have a decent amount of followers on social media, so we started posting: 'These are the places you can go to to donate - if you can't go, contact us, and we'll come and pick donations up directly from your house',"" he says. ""We drove around London, from south to north, everywhere, on Monday and Tuesday.""  They then worked through the night until about 01:00 on Wednesday, packing the donations up, ready to be transported to Turkey on Wednesday afternoon. ""It was a massive communal effort,"" Mr Ates says. ""Unfortunately, in the past few decades, there's been quite a lot of divide among the people of Turkey - whether it's the Turks, Kurds, Alevis or Sunnis. But you can see, when a disaster happens, everyone can put everything aside and come together. We may be different but our families, our neighbours - they're all under the same rubble."" Silan Polat and Sevgi Akgoz are part of the group that's been sorting through donations. The trip, they say, is going to be a struggle for those going. ""Some of the villages are blocked off because the roads are damaged, so people from here are going to try and access those areas however they can,"" Ms Akgoz says. ""There's no electricity, so some people can't even contact us to let us know where they are or what they need.""  Her mum's cousin, she adds, is now homeless and ""trying to survive in their garage"" with their children in -3C temperatures. Others in their village are sleeping in their cars, or out on the street. Ms Polat, whose dad is one of the people going to Turkey, adds: ""It's such a poor area. We go to our parents' and grandparents' villages, and people think 'oh there's technology, people have phones' - they don't, it's a different realm. They don't have access to anything, so they didn't have any pre-warning [about the earthquake]. They don't have news, they don't have electricity or computers.""  Many of the buildings that collapsed, she adds, were built recently - and were supposed to withstand earthquakes.  ""This scale of disaster could have, and should have, been prevented,"" Ms Polat says.  Ms Akgoz says she's been heartened to see people come together - but also can't help but feel guilty.  She says: ""I feel ashamed to sit in my warm house. I feel ashamed to feel full. When I'm about to sleep, I feel ashamed to sleep because I know my family and my friends, my loved ones are there freezing in the cold."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64581995
Turkey and Syria earthquake: Bodies found in search for volleyball team,"Three bodies have been found as rescuers in Turkey search a collapsed hotel for a group of school volleyball players following Monday's earthquakes.  The bodies of two teachers and a student were recovered from the Isias Hotel in Adiyaman, said officials in Turkish-controlled northern Cyprus.  A group of 39 people - including boys' and girls' teams - are said to have been in the building when it came down. The quakes have killed thousands in southern Turkey and northern Syria. The athletes had travelled to Adiyaman from Famagusta Turkish Maarif College, accompanied by teachers and parents. Four of the party are known to have survived after the seven-storey building fell down, having reportedly managed to escape from the rubble themselves. Turkish-Cypriot media quoted officials as saying that the lifeless bodies of two teachers were found on Wednesday - and that the death toll had risen to three after an eighth-grade student was discovered. The number of casualties was confirmed by the BBC Turkish team. Search and rescue efforts continue at the site, where families of the players have gathered. Some 170 people - including relatives and rescuers - have travelled to the wreckage from Turkish-controlled Northern Cyprus.  An education official from the island said they would remain there until the remaining students were found. One mother at the scene questioned the construction of the buildings and asked if they had been adequately inspected. Another woman said her niece, 12-year-old Nehir, had been staying with her in Adiyaman, but had gone to the hotel on the day of the earthquake to join up with friends. Nehir, the youngest member of the girls' team, was still missing along with other children.   Meanwhile, a teacher who survived the quakes said they had not slept since the tremors and that their own daughter remained trapped in the wreckage. Monday morning's initial 7.8-magnitude tremor struck near the Turkish town of Gaziantep, close to the Syrian border.  Numerous aftershocks were felt in both countries. Nearly 16,000 people are known to have died in the two countries. The World Health Organization has warned that many more could lose their lives without shelter, water, fuel or electricity. As freezing weather sets in, hopes are fading for the many still trapped under ruined buildings, more than 72 hours after disaster struck. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64579269

Roger Waters: Pink Floyd star's UN speech criticised by Ukraine,"Pink Floyd star Roger Waters has used a speech to the United Nations to repeat his controversial claim that Russia's invasion of Ukraine was ""provoked"". The musician was invited by Russia to address the UN Security Council. He called for a ceasefire and condemned Russia's ""illegal"" invasion, but also denounced ""provocateurs"" in the West who he claimed were responsible. Ukrainian ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya called Waters' speech ""another brick in the wall"" of Russian disinformation. Russia asked Waters to address the 15-member Security Council following an interview with a German newspaper, in which he praised Vladimir Putin's leadership. However, the 79-year-old singer, who appeared with his dog, surprised his sponsors by modifying his position on the war. ""The invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation was illegal. I condemn it in the strongest possible terms,"" he said via video link. ""Also, the Russian invasion of Ukraine was not unprovoked, so I also condemn the provocateurs in the strongest possible terms."" Rather than representing the view of Russia, the musician said he was speaking on behalf of ""four billion or so brothers and sisters"" - the majority of Earth's population. He continued: ""So what do the voiceless millions have to say? They say thank you for hearing us today. We are many who do not share in the profits of the war industry. ""We do not willingly raise our sons and daughters to provide fodder for your cannons. ""In our opinion, the only sensible course of action today is to call for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine. Not one more Ukrainian or Russian life is to be spent, not one, they are all precious in our eyes."" Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, glossed over the musician's reference to the illegality of the invasion.  The diplomat complimented his ""very precise analysis of events"" and reiterated his belief that the West was waging war against his country. Other members were less enamoured by the speech. The deputy UN ambassador for the US, Richard Mills, said: ""I certainly acknowledge he has impressive credentials as a recording artist. His qualifications to speak to us as an expert briefer on arms control or European security issues seem less evident to me."" Ukraine's Mr Kyslytsya referenced Pink Floyd lyrics in his response, noting that the band had once been outlawed by the Soviet Union for protesting against its 1979 invasion of Afghanistan. ""It is ironic, if not hypocritical, that Mr Waters attempts now to whitewash another invasion,"" said Mr Kyslytsya.  ""How sad for his former fans to see him accepting the role of just another brick in the wall - the wall of Russian disinformation and propaganda."" President Putin has repeatedly blamed Nato's expansion and Ukraine's push to join it for the invasion. But Eastern European countries sought to join the defensive alliance as a protective measure against Russia, while Sweden and Finland applied to join only after the February 2022 invasion. Albania's UN representative, Ferit Hoxha, noted how Waters' former bandmates had released a song in support of Ukraine last year. That release deepened the already-cavernous rift between Waters and Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour. In his interview with Berliner Zeitung, Waters said: ""I find it really, really sad. It encourages the continuation of the war.  ""Pink Floyd is a name I used to be associated with... To associate that name now with something like this proxy war makes me sad."" In response to that statement, and Waters' proclamations about Israel in recent years, Gilmour's wife, Polly Samson, tweeted this week that Waters is ""a Putin apologist"" as well as ""anti-Semitic to your rotten core"". Gilmour endorsed his wife's statement, adding: ""Every word demonstrably true."" Waters called Samson's comments ""incendiary and wildly inaccurate"", and said he refutes them ""entirely"". In a further deterioration of relations, Waters has told the Telegraph he has re-recorded Pink Floyd's iconic 1973 album The Dark Side Of The Moon, to reclaim it from his old band. ""I wrote The Dark Side of the Moon,"" he said. ""Let's get rid of all this 'we' crap. Of course we were a band - there were four of us, we all contributed - but it's my project and I wrote it, so, blah."" According to the official credits on the album, Waters wrote all the lyrics and contributed music to five of the 10 tracks. In his Telegraph interview, the musician tore into his bandmates, including late keyboardist Rick Wright, claiming they ""can't write"" lyrics. ""Well, Nick [Mason, drummer] never pretended. But Gilmour and Rick? They can't write songs, they've nothing to say.  ""They are not artists. They have no ideas - not a single one between them. They never have had, and that drives them crazy.""

Reading: Work on 106-year-old bridge to disrupt traffic,"Network Rail has warned that planned work on a 106-year-old railway bridge will cause some disruption. The bridge on London Road in Reading, built in 1917, has carried trains between the town and Wokingham. Network Rail has announced people should expect traffic disruption while the bridge is repainted to protect it from rust. The company said off peak working would not be possible due to the need for scaffolding to support the carriageway. Network Rail Southern spokesman Chris Denham said engineers will paint one half of the bridge at a time, keeping one lane of the road open with temporary traffic lights. He said the work ""won't just keep the bridge looking good, but will keep the structure in good condition to carry trains well into its second century"". He said: ""It's not ideal as we know this will cause some disruption, but the nature of the work and the need to keep our people safe while doing it, means we need to take this step."" The work is expected to last from 13 February to 9 May, between 07:00 and 18:00 each day. Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. Send your story ideas to south.newsonline@bbc.co.uk.

Brazil expelling illegal miners from indigenous lands,"A major operation to drive out illegal miners from indigenous land is under way in Brazil. Government officials burned a plane and seized boats, weapons and petrol used by the miners in a remote region of the Amazon rainforest, which belongs to the Yanomami indigenous group.  Thousands of illegal gold miners have invaded the indigenous reserve on Brazil's border with Venezuela. The raid is part of a larger policy to halt the advance of illegal mining. It is a joint operation by Brazil's environmental protection agency, Ibama, the indigenous affairs department, Funai, and special forces tasked with protecting the environment.   With an estimated 20,000 illegal miners dispersed throughout the dense jungle region, officials said the aim of the raids was to interrupt the flow of supplies rather than to target individual settlements.  The miners and their illegal activities are a grave threat to the Yanomami indigenous group, which is estimated to have 28,000 members. Diseases, violence and environmental damages caused by the influx have triggered a humanitarian crisis among the Yanomami, resulting in the deaths from preventable diseases and hunger of scores of Yanomami children.  Two weeks ago. the government airlifted 16 members of the group out of the jungle to treat them for malnutrition.  Federal police last month launched an investigation to determine if the previous government of President Jair Bolsonaro could face charges of ""genocide"" after President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who took office on 1 January, said that its treatment of the Yanomami was ""a premeditated crime"". Ex-President Bolsonaro actively encouraged economic development in the Amazon region. Violence there increased during his four years in power, with illegal miners opening fire on indigenous communities. Since the new government started taking action, some illegal miners have been seen leaving the Yanomami lands.  Marcio Astrini of the Climate Observatory, a network of 72 climate NGOs, said it was key to find alternative employment opportunities for the miners, many of whom are very poor.  He told the G1 news site: ""If nothing is done, if these people don't have alternative incomes. they will end up coming back to the areas from which they have been expelled, or they will invade mew ones."" Justice Minister Flávio Dino said the federal government was working on a plan to support them.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-64582235
Teachers' strikes: Wales action postponed after pay offer,"A teachers' strike planned in Wales for next Tuesday has been called off after a new Welsh government pay offer. The National Education Union said it would consult members and postpone its planned strike on 14 February. Teachers have been offered an extra 1.5% on this year's 5% pay award, as well as a 1.5% one-off payment. The National Association of Headteachers also said it would ballot members on the deal while it continues to take action short of a strike. He said the union would consult with branches and workplace representatives to get the views of members. Action planned for Tuesday will be postponed until 2 March. Two further strikes are planned for 15 and 16 March. Hundreds of schools closed or were partially closed due to the first walkout on 1 February, keeping thousands of pupils at home. The Welsh government offer also includes commitments on workload. Secretary of NEU Wales David Evans said workload remained ""a huge issue"" for members. He added that the offer was still ""significantly below"" members' demands but he welcomed the Welsh government's ""willingness to engage in talks"". ""There has also been an agreement to review the Independent Wales Pay Review Board's recommendations on pay for the 2023/24 academic year,"" he added. ""We look forward to providing detailed evidence of the effects of spiralling inflation and cost-of-living crisis to the Independent Welsh Pay Review Body (IWPRB).""

"Dromore man, 38, charged with abduction and paying child for sex","A 38-year-old man from County Down has appeared in court charged with the abduction of a child in care and paying for the sexual services of a child. Paul Livingstone, of Oakhill Road in Dromore, appeared remotely at Ballymena Magistrates' Court. The offences relate to a 16-year-old girl who has been in care since the age of two. A lawyer on behalf of Mr Livingstone said he strenuously denied the charges against him.  The defendant had told police he was in a five-month relationship with the girl and that their sexual relationship was consensual.  An investigating officer told the court that the girl, whom he described as ""vulnerable"", claimed she originally said no to sex, but then said yes.  She also stated that Mr Livingstone gave her money and e-cigarettes in return for sex.  The defendant denied paying for sex, but admitted to giving gifts. Two counts of abduction relate to an occasion in October when the defendant was located with the girl in the back of his van, and again on 7 February at a hotel in Antrim, where staff members raised suspicions.  The court heard that the girl, who is of the age of consent, is under a care order until she turns 18. It heard she was with Mr Livingstone without the knowledge of her primary care giver or social worker. Mr Livingstone's lawyer told the court that the defendant had no knowledge of the care order and that he had been informed by the girl that she was living away from home.   ""The meetings that took place were down to the fact he was a married man and had concerns it would be found out he was cheating,"" the lawyer said.   Granting bail, the judge said he was taking into consideration Mr Livingstone's clear record, his denials and the presumption of innocence to which he was entitled.  He is due to reappear before the court on 14 March. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64584143
In pictures: Seven images of seven marathons on seven continents,"A former Army reservist who made history by becoming the first wheelchair user to complete an international endurance challenge says he hopes to inspire other disabled people. Darren Edwards, from Shropshire, was paralysed from the chest down after a rock climbing accident in Snowdonia in 2017. But the 32-year-old has now completed the World Marathon Challenge, which sees participants complete seven marathons in seven days on seven continents. He said: ""I remember being told about the things I wouldn't be able to do and how life would never quite be the same, and a lot of these messages were quite negative about what life would look like. ""So what I have done in the years that have followed is to try to show a person that might be in a hospital right now, who may be young and active, what is possible when there is hope, and that there is room for aspiration and ambition and to dream."" Mr Edwards has so far raised about £50,000 for the Armed Forces Para-Snowsport Team, a charity which helped him learn to ski after his accident. When he returns to the UK, he will begin planning his next challenge -  skiing across Europe's largest glacier in Iceland in April, spanning 93 miles (150km). He will take on the feat with former professional rugby player and TV presenter Ed Jackson, who suffered a fracture dislocation of two neck vertebrae in 2017, and Niall McCann, who also has a spinal injury.

John Fetterman: US Senate Democrat taken to hospital feeling lightheaded,"US Senator John Fetterman has had an overnight stay at a hospital in Washington after he reported feeling lightheaded. The Pennsylvania Democrat, who was sworn into office last month, suffered a stroke in May and was in recovery for much of his general election campaign. ""Initial tests did not show evidence of a new stroke,"" his communications director Joe Calvello told US media. But doctors had kept Mr Fetterman for overnight observation, he said. Mr Calvello added that the lawmaker ""is in good spirits and talking with his staff and family"". Mr Fetterman is said to have been at a retreat with other Senate Democrats when he began feeling lightheaded and was taken to George Washington University Hospital.In May, Mr Fetterman easily won the Democratic nomination for the open US Senate seat in Pennsylvania four days after suffering a stroke. He is said to have endured a nearly three-hour surgery on the day he won the primary contest, and spent a total of nine days in hospital. According to a statement issued by his doctor, the 53-year-old's stroke was caused by atrial fibrillation, or an irregular heart rhythm. He also suffers from cardiomyopathy, a disease that makes it harder for the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body and can cause heart failure, and was fitted with a pacemaker and defibrillator. Mr Fetterman returned to the campaign trail in August with significant speech impairments, and his health became a focus of an increasingly tight race. But the Democrat ultimately defeated his Republican opponent - Mehmet Oz, better known as the celebrity surgeon Dr Oz - in November's general election by a margin of 51 to 46. That victory, flipping a Republican seat, was key to his party retaining control of the upper chamber. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64584825
Turkey earthquake: Why helping means so much to this family,"When Ozge Ovun-Sert saw video footage of catastrophic damage from the magnitude 7.8 earthquake that struck her home country of Turkey on Monday, she said she was instantly pulled back to the night when she and her family were forced to evacuate their home.  In August 1999, when Ms Ovun-Sert was 22, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake hit her hometown of Izmit, Turkey, killing around 40 of her neighbours in the building next door and forcing her family to sleep in tents for three weeks.  Watching from the US as the Turkey-Syria earthquake claimed thousands of lives in recent days, she and her community have been called to action.  ""Whenever I see something like people being pulled out from rubble, I just can't help but cry and shake and feel helpless,"" said Ms Ovun-Sert, an executive committee member of the American Turkish Association of Washington, DC. ""But then I'm telling myself 'Hey, focus on what you can do from here, because those people need this.'"" In addition to assistance from the US and national governments around the world, the American Turkish Association is one of dozens of local organisations in the US and Canada working to raise millions of dollars and provide support for those affected by the devastating earthquake.  To date, more than 17,000 people have been killed and thousands injured by the quake that hit south-eastern Turkey near the Syrian border. Thousands of buildings have been reduced to rubble and survivors were still being pulled from the wreckage more than 48 hours after the disaster.  The American Turkish Association has raised more than $80,000 (£66,200) in earthquake aid over the past two days, while its umbrella organisation, Turkish Philanthropy Funds, has raised over $3m (£2.48m) to support the victims, Ms Ovun-Sert said.  She said she has been comforted by the dozens of people - some Turkish and others who are not - who have volunteered each day to help pack kits with winter clothes, baby items like diapers and medical supplies to be shipped over to Turkey.  Gizem Salcigil White, founder of a coffee shop named Turkish Coffee Lady in Alexandria, Virginia, and a DC American Turkish Association board member, has also been helping with the nationwide fundraising effort.  Her friends and relatives in Turkey have lost loved ones, and she fears a mounting death toll in the cold winter conditions as people remain trapped under the rubble with little food and water.  ""We're watching those videos and hearing the horror stories,"" she said. ""We can't sleep. We can't eat. We feel so guilty that those people are suffering so much, but we are trying our best to help.""  Their group as well as Syrian communities across the US are planning to hold vigils to honour the lives lost.  The earthquake has delivered another terrible hit to Syrian people who have already been displaced by civil war, said Suzanne Meridian, a Syrian American and the director of community and partner relations at the Syrian American Council.  ""We've been all emotionally tired for the past 11 years,"" she said. ""The emotions are reawakened through this disaster."" But the community has been quick to mobilise, she said. Syrian Americans are writing letters to Congress advocating for more aid and sharing information about the best organisations to donate to, including the on-the-ground volunteer organisation the White Helmets.  The earthquake has been a ""tale of two tragedies"", said Rahul Singh, the executive director and founder of Canadian humanitarian non-profit organisation GlobalMedic. The group has deployed several teams to offer front-line medical assistance in Turkey and to coordinate with partners in Syria. Mr Singh said rescue workers have poured in to help those stuck under the rubble in Turkey, while those in war-torn Syria - where the vast majority of people relied on humanitarian aid even before the earthquake - struggle to receive help.  His team has seen a lot of earthquakes, but this is a ""big one"", he said.  ""It's miles and miles of devastation,"" he said. ""We're pretty seasoned. This is ugly."" Having experienced first-hand the enduring trauma of an earthquake, Ms Ovun-Sert said the American Turkish Association plans to keep raising money even after the emergency rescue teams have gone.  ""This is what we're focusing on right now, instead of focusing on how we cannot be with our loved ones,"" she said.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64519972
Algeria outraged by wanted protester's French escape,"Amira Bouraoui, a key leader of 2019 mass protests that brought down Algeria's president, has escaped to France, sparking a diplomatic row. A doctor by training, the journalist and activist was banned from leaving Algeria pending an appeal trial but was not in detention. The holder of a French passport, she allegedly illegally went to Tunisia and then on to France with diplomatic help. Algeria has recalled its ambassador to Paris over the affair. The Algerian foreign ministry accused French diplomats and other personnel of participating ""in the illegal and secret evacuation of an Algerian national"". It said the incident was unacceptable and caused great damage to relations between Algeria and France, which had been warming recently after decades of animosity.  Bouraoui had been sentenced in 2021 to two years in jail for ""offending Islam"" and insulting the president, but was appealing against the ruling. She had spent 11 days in jail when the case was first in court. Earlier this week, she was arrested in Tunisia when she tried to take a flight and faced an extradition hearing where a judge freed her. Later she was able to board a plane to France, where is it reported she wanted to go to visit her son. Neither the French nor Tunisian governments have commented on the matter. Algeria gained independence from France in 1962 after a bloody seven-year war, which ended more than a century of a colonial rule. Relations had partly improved because France is looking for new suppliers of gas as European countries are boycotting Russia. Bouraoui was one of the key leaders of the anti-government Hirak movement, which led to long-time leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigning in 2019. Her father Mohamed Saleh Bouraoui is a well-known cardiologist and former high-ranking army officer, who once headed a military hospital in the capital, Algiers. After Mr Bouteflika's departure, protests continued against the military elite, which critics believe wields a lot of power in the North African nation. In the last few years, the Algerian authorities have further clamped down on freedom of expression, blocking websites and detaining journalists. The radio station on which Bouraoui used to host a weekly show, Radio M, was banned last year. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64580073

Sheffield scientists behind discovery of rare rings around dwarf planet,"Previously unseen rings around a dwarf planet on the edge of our solar system have been discovered using a camera developed at the University of Sheffield.The rings which were found around Quaoar are similar to ones found around Saturn.An international team of astronomers located them using the HiPERCAM - an extremely sensitive high-speed camera developed by Sheffield scientists.The camera is mounted on the world’s largest optical telescope in the Canary Islands.Quaoar was discovered in 2002 and is around 690 miles (1,110km) in diameter, which is about half the diameter of Pluto.According to the University of Sheffield, the rings were too small and faint to see directly in an image. However, researchers discovered them when light from a star was blocked by Quaoar as it orbited the sun.The dips in brightness, known as an occultation, indicated the presence of a ring system, the scientists said.  Professor Vik Dhillon from the university's Department of Physics and Astronomy, said the HiPERCAM ""was key to this discovery as the event lasted less than one minute"". “It was unexpected to discover this new ring system in our solar system and it was doubly unexpected to find the rings so far out from Quaoar, challenging our previous notions of how such rings form. “Everyone learns about Saturn's magnificent rings when they're a child, so hopefully this new finding will provide further insight into how they came to be.”The Sheffield scientists were part of a group of 59 universities around the world working on the research project.

Troubles legacy: Government showing 'inconsistent approach',"A Labour peer claims the government is showing an ""inconsistency in approach"" to dealing with the legacy of the Northern Ireland Troubles. Baroness Angela Smith suggested there was an inconsistency by granting an inquiry into the Omagh bomb while pushing ahead with the legacy bill. Last week, the government announced a judge-led statutory inquiry into the 1998 bombing. The legacy bill would see a ban imposed on legal actions and inquests. The inquiry into the Omagh bombing, which claimed the lives of 29 people, will consider if it could have been prevented by security forces. The Real IRA attack happened four months after the Good Friday Agreement, which the government is using as a cut-off point to its Legacy bill. Under the legislation, which offers conditional immunity to perpetrators, future investigations into Troubles incidents between 1966-1998 would be limited, as well as a ban imposed on legal actions and inquests. Baroness Smith said: ""We generally welcome the approach the government is taking [on Omagh]. ""But it is impossible not to note that it is different from the Legacy Bill. ""I am not aware, even with all the work undertaken, that the government has managed to deliver any significant support for the bill going forward."" In response, Northern Ireland Office minister Lord Jonathan Caine said Omagh was by definition outside the scope of the bill. ""Were it to be in, it would have a consequence which I do not think would be welcomed across the house, enabling people who were involved in dissident republican activities to apply for conditional immunity,"" he said. ""I do not entirely accept there is some kind of total contrast between what we are doing on Omagh and what we are doing on legacy. ""Not every case can have a public inquiry."" Former First Minister Baroness Arlene Foster urged the government to put pressure on Dublin to hold a similar inquiry into Omagh. ""It was planned and prepared in a different jurisdiction and if we are to get totality of answers that needs to happen as well,"" she said. Lord Caine said he took the issue seriously and he will be raising it with Irish government ministers soon. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64584144
Mobile and broadband price hikes to be investigated,"The communications regulator Ofcom is investigating mobile phone and broadband operators who increase prices for customers mid-contract.  The regulator says it is ""concerned"" about the degree of uncertainty consumers face about future price rises outlined by providers. Customers' budgets are currently being squeezed as inflation - the rate at which prices rise - hits record highs. Companies say their monthly charges can increase in line with official figures. Dramatic rises in inflation over the course of the last year mean many customers have seen their contract charges increase significantly, and are likely to see that again this April.  Inflation figures are released every month, showing the average price increase or decrease across lots of different products. That rise often happens in April.  Given that contract lengths are often 18 months or more, the possibility for big changes in the inflation rate are likely during the lifetime of a contract, and customers often have no way of ending those contracts without paying an exit fee if the payments become unaffordable.  The question the regulator is looking at is whether the scale of price variation is made clear enough to customers when they sign up to a new phone or broadband deal.  Ofcom says it will publish its report later this year, and make a decision on whether or not it will intervene to make sure that customers know exactly what they could be paying when they sign the contract.

Park Gate dentist struck off over fake records and letters,"A dentist who fabricated records to cover up poor patient care has been struck off for ""serious dishonesty"". Manori Dilini Balachandra, who set up Manor Dental Surgery in Park Gate, Hampshire, in 2007, was found guilty of 103 charges by the General Dental Council (GDC). It said patients were at risk of ""serious harm"", particularly over the inappropriate use of antibiotics and missing information in their records. Ms Balachandra has 28 days to appeal. In its report, the GDC told her: ""This is a case in which failings in your clinical care and record-keeping were identified by an NHS official. ""Your response to those concerns was to embark on a course of dishonest conduct in an attempt to contradict them. ""Whilst the Committee acknowledged your engagement with this hearing, it considered it significant that there has been little evidence of remorse, regret or insight in a case involving such serious dishonesty."" False information relating to patient care was retrospectively written on NHS record cards, while faked letters, purporting to withdraw mistaken claims for NHS fees, were also given to investigators, the GDC said. Some patients were prescribed antibiotics without justification or at the wrong dose, while others had no record of treatment for infections, it added. The council concluded there had been ""widespread and serious failings"" relating to 11 patients.

Treasury tightens controls on new spending in Michael Gove's department,"The government department in charge of levelling up has had controls on its spending tightened because of Treasury concerns about value for money. Levelling Up Minister Lee Rowley confirmed to MPs the Treasury would have to sign off all new capital schemes, including building projects. Previously the department headed by Michael Gove could spend up to £30m on such schemes without Treasury approval. Mr Gove no longer had the ""authority to sign off on a park bench"", Labour said. Asking about the move in the Commons, shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy questioned whether Chancellor Jeremy Hunt believed Mr Gove had ""gone rogue, because that would be a very serious thing indeed"".  Mr Rowley replied that there had been no change to the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) budget or policies, and ""no dilution of our ambition"".  He accepted there would be more Treasury oversight of some future spending, saying ""processes change and they also may apply at times in different ways"". He added: ""We will always work closely with Treasury, we value their value-for-money focus, they value our mission and they share our mission to level up the country as a whole, and we will continue to do that."" He also told Conservative Bob Blackman that ""where commitments have been made, it's my understanding they will be adhered to"".  Labour MP Clive Betts, who chairs the Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee, said the development showed the Treasury no longer trusted the department.  On Tuesday, the Financial Times reported that Treasury minister John Glen had stepped in to stop DLUHC signing off any new capital spending.  The BBC understands the Treasury decision does not relate to any specific spending commitment made by the department. As well as levelling up, it oversees spending for housing, local authorities and the government's shared prosperity fund, which replaced EU structural funds. The levelling up agenda was a central plank of the Conservatives' 2019 election manifesto. It aims to close the gap between richer and poorer parts of the country by improving services such as transport, education and broadband.  But concerns have been expressed - including by some Tories - about the system used to distribute billions of pounds in grants.  In January, Conservative West Midlands mayor Andy Street condemned the process and called for an end to Whitehall's ""broken begging bowl culture"". After his region received £155m from the latest £2.1bn pot of levelling up funds, he urged ministers to justify why ""the majority"" of bids in the West Midlands had been rebuffed.  Rishi Sunak said his government was ""completely committed to levelling up across the United Kingdom"". The PM said the process was transparent, and that areas which had been unsuccessful this time would get another chance to apply for funding in a third round. Many local authorities have complained about the complexities and costs involved in the bidding process and delays in the allocation of funding.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64581864

""It's indicative of the dedication and incredible care we as an organisation provide for each species, from the largest to the very smallest."" Only three small populations of Pacific pocket mice remain, according to the alliance. Native to coastal scrublands, dunes and riverbanks near California's Pacific ocean, the pocket mouse's range once stretched from Los Angeles to the US-Mexico border. But due to human encroachment and habitat degradation, their numbers plummeted after 1932. They were thought to be extinct for decades, but in 1994 a small population was discovered in southern California. In 2012, the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance launched a conservation breeding programme to help save the species from extinction.  A record 31 litters of pocket mice, for a total of 117 pups, were produced by the alliance team in 2022. The Pacific pocket mouse is the smallest mouse species in North America. Its tiny name, however, is not derived from its tiny stature but because of the cheek pouches the animal uses to carry food and nesting materials.  Though small, they play a big role in maintaining their ecosystems by dispersing the seeds of native plants and encouraging plant growth through their digging activities.

Neath: Family took £300k from friends in property scam,"A mother and her three sons swindled their friends out of more than £300,000 in a property scam, a court has heard. Audrey Osborne, 66, Clayton Moore, 48, Ian Moore, 46, and Gary Moore, 44, told their friends they were investing in a five-home property development in Neath, but it never materialised. The family also over estimated their income to obtain mortgages totalling £2.5m between 2005 and 2009. They have been sentenced to a total of 11 years and four months in prison.  Judge Richard Twomlow said that the four's predictions for the return on the investments were ""founded on some sort of fantasy"". Nine people who invested between £20,000 and £104,000 in the failed ""Dreamscape Homes"" property development knew and trusted the family, Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard. They received share certificates, but no return on their money as the land was never developed. Some investors re-mortgaged their homes to provide the money.  On Thursday the court heard that some had suffered significant financial hardship as a result. Judge Twomlow told the four ""the investors trusted you implicitly"" but ""all investors lost all their money"" and some had consequently been ""burdened by debt for years"". The judge said he accepted the mortgage broking company and property development company had been ""initially genuine projects"" but that when the firms began ""sinking"", more money was sought which went into personal accounts to try and keep the businesses afloat. The family sent emails to the investors to try and reassure them when problems started. The judge said they ""seemed to border on the delusional"", adding that the family's motivation was ""greed followed by self-preservation"". Ian Moore, of Main Road, Cilfrew, Neath Port Talbot, was sentenced to two years and four months in prison, while the other three, of Forest Hill, Aberdulais, Neath Port Talbot, will each serve a three-year jail term.  A later hearing will consider whether a proceeds of crime order should be imposed to recover fraudulently obtained money. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64583026
"Green Man farm site should be sold, Labour MS says","The Labour Welsh government has been urged by one of its own Senedd members to sell the farm bought for £4.25m to help a festival company. Mike Hedges said ministers should never have purchased Gilestone Farm, near Talybont-on-Usk, Powys, for Green Man. The acquisition was controversial after it emerged the Welsh government bought the site before Green Man submitted a full business plan. The Welsh government declined to comment. Last week Auditor General for Wales Adrian Crompton said ministers acted with ""avoidable haste"" to buy the farm, and that officials ""did not keep a record of matters discussed"" with the company in meetings. The Welsh government said the report made clear the acquisition followed ""appropriate processes"" and was ""value for money"". Officials have been discussing leasing the site to the festival company. While it is not expected that the main Green Man festival itself would move to the site, officials have told councillors there are plans to hold three gatherings a year for as many as 3,000 people at the farm. Meanwhile the Welsh government has published a report that says the flood risk at the site is ""moderate to high"". ""I just don't think it's a good use of resources,"" the Swansea East Senedd member said. ""We've got things we can do with that sort of money."" ""I don't believe the Welsh government should be out there getting involved in funding tourism projects."" While he said the Urdd and National Eisteddfod, which receive Welsh government subsidies, were ""slightly different,"" he asked: ""How much do music festivals dotted around Britain get from local authorities or the Westminster government? ""These people run it - they make money and they run it as a commercial venture. ""I think it's about time some organisations decided whether they were commercial or not."" Mr Hedges said the Welsh government ""should never have got into it in the first place"". Asked if the Welsh government should sell, he said: ""Yeah."" ""If Green Man want to buy it, I have no problem with selling it to Green Man at the price we paid."" ""One of my real worries in Wales is that we seem so obsessed by farming and tourism is that we don't seem to realise that they're not the industries that make you wealthy. ""We almost seem to have an economic policy that looks at Greece and says we can emulate that."" Meanwhile, the Welsh government has published a report from 2022 which says the overall flood risk for the site is ""moderate to high"". ""While the built area of the site does not appear to be at risk of river flooding, large areas of arable land could flood to significant depths,"" it said. ""As a result, crop yield could be lost during a flood event, with potential financial implications,"" the report said.  The document was published in response to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request. The same FOI request has disclosed two valuation reports - one by Knight Frank estimating the site to be worth £4.325m, and another from Powells which assesses the site's land, house and buildings at £4.25m. The Knight Frank valuation details that the 241 acre farm includes a grade II listed farmhouse with seven bedrooms, a tented site, and community orchard. Green Man was also approached for comment.

Burt Bacharach obituary: Classy and complex songs that transcended an era,"Burt Bacharach was one of the last of the great popular songwriters of the 20th Century.    Together with Hal David, he created songs that became standards in their own right. They were classy, catchy, commercial and musically complex, and scores of them became hits during a career that lasted more than 50 years.   His songs transcended the rock era; never fashionable but never out of fashion. Burt Freeman Bacharach was born in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1928 but grew up in New York, where his father was a well-known newspaper columnist. He developed an interest in jazz as a teenager, often blagging his way into many of New York's jazz clubs while technically under age. He studied music in Montreal and California and found himself hanging out with composer John Cage, who was a major influence. Bacharach did his army service in Korea and, when he returned to civilian life, he found work as a composer and arranger, writing songs for a host of performers, including actress and singer Paula Stewart, whom he later married. At one stage in the late 1950s and early 1960s, he accompanied Marlene Dietrich, as she took her cabaret act around Europe and the United States.   By then, he had teamed up with the lyricist David. They met at the famous Brill Building in New York, just north of Times Square on Broadway, where scores of music publishers and popular songwriters had offices.  They had their first big hits in 1957 and 1958 - The Story of My Life, recorded by Marty Robbins, and Magic Moments, sung by Perry Como, which went to No 1 in the UK. As the 1960s dawned, it seemed the duo could do no wrong as they produced hit after hit for a string of well-known artists. Gene Pitney recorded 24 Hours From Tulsa, The Walker Brothers had a hit with Make It Easy on Yourself and Dusty Springfield charted with I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself.  Inspired by his second wife, actress Angie Dickinson, Bacharach wrote songs for the cinema, including Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head, from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and the eponymous Alfie, which was a hit for Cilla Black.  The latter gained an Oscar nomination for best song, as did the theme for What's New Pussycat, recorded by Tom Jones, and The Look of Love, a hit for Dionne Warwick. It was with Warwick, a singer the pair had hired to cut demo records, that the duo enjoyed their most successful and enduring collaboration. Starting with Don't Make Me Over in 1962, she recorded a string of almost 40 Bacharach and David hits over the next 10 years, including Walk On By, Do You Know the Way to San Jose? and I'll Never Fall in Love Again. By the beginning of the 1970s, Bacharach and David had written more than 100 songs but their partnership was unravelling. A musical version of the 1937 film Lost Horizon was a costly flop. and generated a number of lawsuits. Bacharach's partnership with David broke up. His marriage to Angie Dickinson was also in trouble and his music less in demand. But Bacharach made a comeback in the 1980s, writing hits like the theme song for the film Arthur with his third wife, Carole Bayer Sager.   Together they went on to write Making Love for Roberta Flack, That's What Friends Are For, sung by Dionne Warwick, and songs for Gladys Knight, Neil Diamond and Patti Labelle. Much younger songwriters, like Noel Gallagher of Oasis, expressed admiration for Bacharach's music and others wanted to work with him.   He collaborated with Elvis Costello and rapper Doctor Dre, and also appeared on screen (as himself) in the Austin Powers films. In June 2015, Bacharach performed on stage at the Glastonbury Festival to a rapturous welcome. The sheer familiarity of Bacharach's music meant the cleverness of much of it was sometimes overlooked: it was dismissed as ""elevator music"" or ""easy listening"".  But a typical Bacharach composition was rhythmically complex, often wrong-footing the listener with sudden changes of time signature and irregular phrasing.   The harmonies were sometimes unconventional (Bacharach was said to have been influenced by the bebop jazz of his youth) and he excelled at producing the soaring musical hook that sticks in the mind and refuses to leave. Above all, his songs are musically sophisticated and they invited sophisticated interpretations from his singers - one reason, perhaps, why later generations of songwriters positively revered him.

Chinese balloon capable of gathering intelligence - US official,"A suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that the US shot down this week was able to collect communications signals, a US official has said.  It was equipped with multiple antennas capable of ""intelligence collection operations"", a senior State Department official said in a background briefing. The US believes the balloon is part of a wider fleet of surveillance balloons that has spanned five continents. China has denied the balloon was used for spying purposes.  It has said the balloon was a weather device blown astray. Its appearance in US airspace has provoked a diplomatic crisis and led US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel a trip to China - the first such high level US-China meeting there in years. The US military used a fighter jet to shoot the balloon down over the Atlantic Ocean over the weekend. ""We know [China] used these balloons for surveillance,"" the senior State Department official said on Thursday. ""The high-altitude balloons' equipment was clearly for intelligence surveillance and inconsistent with the equipment on-board weather balloons,"" the official added.  High resolution images revealed the balloon - which was about 200 ft (60 metres) tall  - had large solar panels capable of operating ""multiple active intelligence collection sensors"" as well as antennas that were able to collect and geo-locate communications, the official said. The balloon manufacturer also had a direct relationship with China's military and is an approved state military vendor, the official said.  US intelligence, military and foreign policy officials are briefing members of Congress on Thursday about the balloon. At a Wednesday news conference, Defence Department spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder confirmed that the US believed similar balloons had operated over North and South America, South East Asia, East Asia and Europe.

"I felt like a monster after stabbing baby, mum tells Belfast court","A woman who stabbed her baby and toddler told police she ""felt like a monster"", her trial has heard. The mother is charged with murdering her eight-week-old son and attempting to murder his two-year-old sister in July 2021. She accepts she stabbed the children but denies the charges.  On Thursday, the jury at her trial was read transcripts from the audio recordings of her police interviews that took place after the stabbings.  This article contains descriptions of violence which some readers may find distressing. In those recordings, the woman told police what had happened in the moments leading up to the incident.  She said she had been at home alone with her children.  Her baby was sleeping, she told police, and her daughter was dancing to Old MacDonald Had A Farm, which the court was told was the toddler's favourite song.  The woman told police she had been texting her partner and asked when he was coming to visit the children but that he ""wasn't interested"". She said she was crying and her daughter was ""wiping her tears"". The woman said she took a knife from a kitchen drawer and went to her baby. She told police: ""He turned his little head and smiled at me, and I couldn't do it. ""I can't do this to my children, that's what I said to myself.  ""To be honest I wanted to kill all three, all of us, so the father would have a happy life with his woman.""  The woman said she then put the knife down and had a cigarette, and a few minutes later she lifted the knife again and went to her baby. She told police: ""I kissed him. I'm so sorry. I said I loved him."" She said she then stabbed the baby ""close to the heart"". She told police: ""He started to cry. I tried to bring him back to life. I pressed on his chest to help him. ""I told myself you've done it, now we all need to die."" The woman told police she then lifted her daughter, who was watching cartoons on YouTube, and set her beside her brother on the bed. She said she would sleep on a bed in the living room with her children, while her partner slept in the bedroom upstairs.  In the transcript, read to court, the woman said: ""She kissed her brother, I hugged her and told her that I loved her."" The woman said she then went on to stab her daughter. Then she tried to kill herself but after hearing her daughter call, ""mum"", she could not do it, she told police. ""I will never release that burden,"" she said. ""I tried to resuscitate [the baby] but he didn't come back. ""I held [my daughter] in my arms so she didn't die too.  ""Oh my God, what have I done? ""I feel like a monster. To be honest I don't deserve to live because of what I did to my children. ""Everything is because of him."" She told police: ""I did not plan this,"" adding that it was the ""only solution"" that came into her mind. When asked why she had stabbed her children, the woman told police she felt ""threatened and unsafe"". She alleged her partner had told her his family would ""shoot her"", and that her family would ""never know"". ""He brought us into this situation. He made a joke out of us and I can't take it any more,"" she said.  ""I felt very alone and needed him. The children needed him. ""But he didn't care. He only cared about where his woman was.""  The woman told police she tried to call a family member, her partner's family member and her partner, but he did not answer until after she had stabbed their children. After speaking to her partner, the woman called the emergency services.  The court was told her partner was unwell and unfit to attend court.  The judge in the trial excused the defendant from court while some of the evidence was being read, after she became visibly distressed. The trial resumes next week.

Six Nations: Doddie Weir cyclists travel to Edinburgh,"About 180 cyclists have left Cardiff, destined for Edinburgh, with the match ball for Saturday's Six Nations match.  Wales take on Scotland for the Doddie Weir Cup - named after the home side's former second row, who died in November after battling motor neurone disease. Following his diagnosis in 2016, he raised millions for research work. A star-studded group, including Olympian Sir Chris Hoy and England World Cup winner Martin Johnson will travel the 555 mile (893 km) distance. The riders are being led by Weir's former teammate Rob Wainwright, who will deliver the match ball on to the pitch at Murrayfield on Saturday.  ""This year marks the fourth anniversary of the Doddie Weir Cup, and it's particularly poignant as it's the first since Doddie's passing in November, but this only drives us forward to continue making progress and raising awareness of motor neurone disease,"" he added. The group left Cardiff's Principality Stadium on Thursday morning and will through Kidwelly and Llandovery in Carmarthenshire, then Wrexham, before heading through England and up to Scotland. The Doddie Cup 555 Ride is to raise funds and awareness of the My Name'5 Doddie Foundation, which is leading research into motor neurone disease.  Edinburgh-born Weir, who was capped 61 times for Scotland, died in 2022 at the age of 52. ""We have to believe that a breakthrough in motor neurone disease treatment is just round the corner, and push ourselves and others to raise funds to realise that dream,"" Wainwright added. The ride is taking place during the last week of Doddie Aid 2023, a UK-wide fundraising event where more than 38,000 fundraisers are aiming to raise more than £500,000. Former England rugby captain Martin Johnson said: ""Doddie was an inspiration to all of us, and the life and soul of one of the most important periods in our lives in South Africa in 1997 (with the British and Irish Lions). ""That spirit will be our motivation on this adventure. Jim Telfer famously described that tour as our Everest, but for those 48 hours, it will be the 555 miles to Edinburgh.""

Dáithí's Law: Parties urged to elect Speaker to pass donation bill,"The Northern Ireland secretary has put fresh pressure on Stormont parties to elect an assembly Speaker in order to pass stalled opt-in organ donation laws. BBC News NI has seen a letter from Chris Heaton-Harris in which he holds back the prospect of Westminster resolving the issue. The law has been held up due to the Stormont stalemate. It should have come into effect this spring. The government was urged to solve the issue by including it in a bill extending the period for executive formation. Stormont has been without a power-sharing government for 12 months due to the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) boycott in protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol. On Friday its leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson met the parents of Dáithí Mac Gabhann, whose family have campaigned for organ donation laws to be changed. Sir Jeffrey said the ""quickest way"" to progress the legislation was through Westminster and that Northern Ireland MPs would work together on it. However, it is understood that the scope of the latest Executive Formation bill may be too narrow for MPs to table an amendment relating to organ donation laws. In a letter to Stormont's party leaders issued on Thursday, Mr Heaton-Harris said if the parties recalled the assembly it could have ""this legislation in place in a matter of days"". ""This would only require MLAs [assembly members] to work together to elect a speaker, not necessarily nominate a first and deputy first minister,"" he added. He said with a Speaker in place, MLAs could then approve secondary legislation that is needed to specify which organs and tissues are covered under the opt-out system. Mr Heaton-Harris said this could all happen in one sitting. ""This would be the quickest, most straight-forward path to progressing this important legislation that Dáithí and his family have campaigned so tirelessly for - than for me to bring forward primary legislation in the UK Parliament, which as you know would be a long and arduous process,"" he added. It is understood Mr Heaton-Harris has also communicated this to Dáithí's parents. Daithi and his parents travelled to England earlier this week for a cardiac procedure at a hospital in Newcastle. Parties at Stormont have so far failed to elect a new assembly Speaker five times since the election last May. Without a Speaker, no other business can take place. The DUP has insisted it will not support the election of a speaker until changes are made to the NI Protocol, which it can support.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64587207
Swansea: Photographer with two years' experience snaps up top award,"A press photographer in Wales who took up the profession two years ago says she is ""overwhelmed"" after winning a prestigious award.  Joann Randles, 34, from Swansea took first prize in the portrait category of the British Press Photographers' Association's (BPPA) photographer of the year competition. The former film and television producer saw all her work dry up during the first Covid lockdown and started to experiment taking pictures. ""It became increasingly difficult to express myself creatively,"" she remembered. ""I started taking pictures, mainly of Gower [wild] ponies."" After honing her skills on horses, Joann said her interest turned to capturing people.  Her first break came after a photoshoot with the Rother Bobbers, a group of women who swim in Langland Bay. Her snap, 'Brilliantly British', featuring a woman on the beach draped in a union flag won a Daily Express photo award in 2021. ""It ended being exhibited in the Victoria and Albert Museum, which was just surreal,"" she said.   ""I was able to transpose my skills from TV and put them into photography, because really it is all about telling stories,"" she said. ""It's just with photography the story in a single frame."" Joann got her press card in 2021 and started working as a freelancer for a photo agency.  Like most journalists, she said, her ""brain is working 99% of the time coming up with ideas"".  It also means dropping everything when a storm rolls through Wales or a big story breaks. But her passion is portraiture.  ""It's really important to get the backstory... the personalities and anything you can add to the photo about who they are as a person,"" she said.  The portfolio of six portraits that won top honours at this year's BPPA competition includes a snap of Darren 'Graceland' Jones, a well-known Elvis tribute artist from Pontypool. ""I wanted to photograph him in his home environment away from spotlight,"" she said. ""He's still in the spotlight but in his living room."" One winning a top award after just two years in the business Joann said: ""It's been overwhelming. ""I'm really proud, but I never expected to receive the recognition I've had so rapidly."" ""Working alone you are not seeing what you are doing,"" she said, explaining that her confidence has grown with her peers appreciating her work. Her goal is to do more UK-wide and international work in the next two years.  For aspiring photographers, her advice is to ""just pick up a camera"" but she warns there is a ""phenomenal"" amount of hard work to do.

Seven Russians sanctioned over ransomware cyber-crime,"Seven Russian men have been sanctioned by the UK and US for having links to recent ransomware attacks.  The UK's Foreign Office, along with US authorities, has released pictures of the men, frozen their assets and imposed travel restrictions. US authorities have accused them of being members of loosely defined Russian-based hacking network Trickbot. Ransomware strains Conti and Ryuk extorted at least £27m in ransoms from 149 British victims. ""This is a hugely significant moment for the UK and our collaborative efforts with the US to disrupt international cyber-criminals,"" said National Crime Agency director general Graeme Biggar. ""The sanctions are the first of their kind for the UK and signal the continuing campaign targeting those responsible for some of the most sophisticated and damaging ransomware that has impacted the UK and our allies,"" he said. The National Cyber Security Centre, a part of GCHQ, has assessed that key group members are ""highly likely"" to have strong links to the Russian Intelligence Services from which they are sometimes directed.  No evidence was supplied to support this allegation. The UK government categorises ransomware as a tier one national security threat with recent victims including UK schools, local authorities and firms.  The individuals sanctioned are: Vitaliy Kovalev, Valery Sedletski, Valentin Karyagin, Maksim Mikhailov, Dmitry Pleshevskiy, Mikhail Iskritskiy and Ivan Vakhromeyev.  Any arrests are impossible unless the accused leave the country. The group behind the Conti strain has targeted hospitals, schools, businesses and local authorities, including the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.  It extorted $180m (£148m) in ransomware in 2021 alone, according to research from Chainalysis.   Ireland's Health Service Executive was targeted by Conti ransomware actors during the Covid pandemic, leading to disruption to blood tests, X-rays, CT scans, radiotherapy and chemotherapy appointments over 10 days.     Another recent ransomware attack included Harrogate-based transportation and cold storage firm Reed Boardall, whose IT systems were under attack for nearly a week in 2021.    Although Conti disbanded in 2022, its members are thought to have continued their attacks under different guises.  Russia has for years denied that it is harbouring ransomware hackers, but cyber-security experts say there is compelling evidence that many of the criminal groups are co-ordinated from the country.  Many of the gangs operate on Russian-language forums, there are fewer attacks on Russian organisations, and the frequency of hacks dips during Russian public holidays. The latest sanctions follow multinational efforts to disrupt ransomware crews, most recently by sabotaging the Hive ransomware crew and taking them offline.  Previously the US and UK worked together on sanctions issued against alleged members of cyber-crime group Evil Corp in 2020. Authorities allege that some of the men in the latest sanctions could have formerly worked for the group.  In 2021 the BBC went to Russia to try to track down the group and was told by a family member that the sanctions had made them fear for their safety. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64586361
Venezuela country profile,"Venezuela is a country of striking natural beauty, and one of the most highly-urbanised in Latin America. It has some of the world's largest proven oil deposits as well as huge quantities of coal, iron ore, bauxite and gold. Yet many Venezuelans live in poverty, often in shanty towns, some of which sprawl over the hillsides around the capital Caracas. Former president Hugo Chavez , who died in 2013, styled himself a champion of the poor during his 14 years in office, pouring billions of dollars of Venezuela's oil wealth into social programmes.  But the government of his successor, Nicolas Maduro, has had to struggle with plummeting oil prices and an economic and political crisis that has left Venezuela in a state of near-collapse.   President: Nicolas Maduro President Nicolas Maduro has governed since March 2013, following the death of his mentor Hugo Chavez. He was re-elected president for a second six-year term in May 2018, in a poll marred by an opposition boycott and claims of vote-rigging. At the time, Venezuela was in the throes of a deep economic crisis, with rampant inflation and lack of basic necessities, despite boasting the world's biggest oil reserves.  Mr Maduro failed to undertake any significant reforms of the state-run economy, and established a Constituent Assembly to bypass the National Assembly and strengthen his grip on power. Venezuela's political polarisation is mirrored in the media.  State TV coverage routinely ignores the opposition. Critical and exile media operate online. Many journalists have fled because of threats and physical dangers, says Reporters Without Borders.  The government and its opponents use social media as a battleground. Read full media profile  Some key dates in Venezuela's history: 1810 - Venezuelans take advantage of Napoleon's invasion of Spain to declare independence. 1870-88 - Ruler Antonio Guzman Blanco attracts foreign investment, modernises infrastructure and develops agriculture and education. 1908-35 - Dictator Juan Vicente Gomez governs at time when Venezuela becomes world's largest oil exporter. 1964 - Venezuela's first presidential handover from one civilian to another takes place when Raul Leoni is elected president. 1973 - Venezuela benefits from oil boom and its currency peaks against the US dollar; oil and steel industries nationalised. 1989 - Carlos Andres Perez elected president amid economic depression, launches austerity programme with IMF loan. Riots, martial law and general strike follow, with hundreds killed in street violence. 1998 - Hugo Chavez elected president amid disenchantment with established parties, launches 'Bolivarian Revolution' that brings in new constitution, socialist and populist economic and social policies funded by high oil prices, and increasingly vocal anti-US foreign policy. 2013 - President Chavez dies at age 58 after a battle with cancer.

Political unrest, corruption and chronic economic problems have plagued its fragile democracy since it emerged from the 35-year dictatorship of the Alfredo Stroessner in 1989.  The economy is reliant on agriculture and hydroelectric power. Unlike its neighbours, Paraguay does not have a large tourism industry. Most of the population is of mixed Spanish and Guarani descent, and speak the indigenous language Guarani as well as Spanish. The Triple Frontier region, where Paraguay meets Argentina and Brazil, has long been associated with drug-smuggling and other contraband trade. President: Mario Abdo Benítez Former senator Mario Abdo Benítez, of the Colorado Party, assumed office in August 2018. He narrowly triumphed in a presidential election held three months earlier, having promised to maintain low tax policies in order to encourage foreign investment. His victory meant that the right-wing Colorado Party, which has dominated Paraguayan politics for decades, maintained its hold on power. Mr Benítez is the son of a close aide to the late military dictator Alfredo Stroessner, whose record he has faced criticism for defending. Private and public outlets make up the broadcasting landscape and media ownership is highly concentrated. The media operate with few official curbs. Crime reporting can be perilous in an area bordering Brazil and Argentina.  Some key dates in Paraguay's history: 1500s - Originally inhabited by the indigenous Guarani people before the arrival of the first Spanish settlers. 1811 - Declares independence from Spain  1865-70 - War of the Triple Alliance against Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay leads to loss of two-thirds of the adult male population, much territory, and a crippling war debt 1932-35 - After decades of economic stagnation, Paraguay wins swathes of land from Bolivia in the Chaco War. 1947 - Following a brief civil war, the right-wing Colorado Party dominates politics for the next 60 years. 1954-1989 - Army chief Alfredo Stroessner seizes power in a coup and rules for 35 years until he is overthrown by Gen Andres Rodriguez 1992 - New constitution paves the way for free elections. Despite a failed coup attempt in 1996 and a succession of presidents, there is a long period of political instability and party infighting. 2008 - Six decades of rule by the right-wing Colorado Party is brought to an end when former bishop Fernando Lugo is elected president, but the party returns to power in 2013 with the election of political newcomer Horacio Cartes ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19978115
Turkey and Syria earthquakes: Welsh government donates,"The Welsh government is giving £300,000 to victims of Monday's deadly earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. It has made the commitment towards the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) appeal as the death toll reaches more than 19,000 people.  Millions have been left without homes in freezing conditions and desperately need blankets, emergency shelter, food and clean water.  The UK government is matching the funds raised - up to £5,000,000. Wales' Social Justice Minister Jane Hutt offered her condolences to those who had lost loved ones and said her thoughts were also with Turkish and Syrian people in Wales waiting apprehensively for news. ""The scale of destruction is vast, and I'd like to thank the brave search and rescue teams who continue to search through the rubble for survivors,"" she said. Five firefighters from Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service and South Wales Fire and Rescue Service have been deployed to Turkey to assist with search and rescue operations. The team are equipped with specialist search equipment including seismic listening devices, concrete cutting and breaking equipment and propping and shoring tools.  Emir Cecen, a barista at Cafe Unwind in Newport, is from Adiyaman in Turkey where his family have been left homeless by the earthquake. He has helped to fill a van of donations, which left Newport on Tuesday. He told Radio Wales Breakfast: ""It is a very difficult time.  ""I woke up and I'd received twenty, thirty missed calls from friends, family, friends over here.  ""It was really devastating."" He added: ""My family are out on the streets. My mother is sleeping in a school, alongside my uncle, my auntie and my nan. ""My dad is also outside in his car. My hometown is nearly 80% wiped out and there's still a lot of people underneath the rubble.  ""One of my close friends, who lives with me here in Newport, his mother is also underneath the rubble as well. He hasn't been able to get in touch with her and it's been so long now.  ""They need that anything really that people can give and support them with."" Sian Stephen, external relations manager for Wales at the DEC, told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""The scale of the disaster is enormous. ""Fifteen thousand people have lost their lives, so many more injured and thousands of buildings have collapsed.  ""We know there are 17,000,000 people in the affected area and people who survived this terrible experience need urgent help.  ""We've heard that in the northwest of Syria, people living in tents because they have been displaced by the war are now hosting families have lost their homes and many others are living in cars, but the freezing conditions are hampering rescue efforts and also making it making it very dangerous for survivors.""

The Hardwick: Simon Nightingale denies part in fraud,"A bookkeeper who stole £150,000 from a former Michelin star chef was an ""alcoholic"" who ""ran family finances"", her daughter said.  Nicola Nightingale was an administrator at The Hardwick Restaurant in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire.  Mrs Nightingale has already pleaded guilty to fraud by abuse of position. Her husband Simon Nightingale, 50, of Deal, Kent, denies acquiring criminal property and is on trial at Cardiff Crown Court. He had more than £46,000 from the restaurant paid into his account by his wife, the court heard. Mrs Nightingale worked for restaurant owner Stephen Terry, who trained under celebrity chef Marco Pierre White. On Thursday, Cardiff Crown Court heard that Mrs Nightingale paid money into her own bank accounts and accounts belonging to her husband and daughter. Between February 2018 and May 2020, she transferred £150,000 into different accounts, including £46,741 to her husband's current account. Mr Nightingale, an executive chef, told the court he often worked away during the week so his wife ""took charge"" of his bank account, into which her wages were also paid. He said her wage varied and he did not know what she earned.  The court heard Jasmine Nightingale, 22, moved with her family into a house they were renting in Gilwern, Monmouthshire, in 2017 when her parents were separated.  The couple got back together after a three-year separation in early 2018 but often still argued, with Ms Nightingale describing her mother as ""horrible"".  ""She resented my father and was a nasty person - argumentative and bitter,"" she said. She told the court she started working at the restaurant in February 2018 as a waitress and worked about 25 shifts.  Her mother had started working at the restaurant as an office administrator shortly before and had organised the work and her pay, Ms Nightingale said.  When defence barrister Martin Taylor asked if the relationship between her mother and father improved between 2018 and 2019, she said: ""It got worse. ""Mum drank every day after work from 15:30 until she passed out. Dad would ask her to stop drinking but she wouldn't."" She said her mother was in control of the finances and would make ""every decision"".  Prosecutor Thomas Stanway asked whether the tenancy on the house in Gilwern and the bills were all sorted by her father.  She told him the money came out of the family account - her father's - which she only became aware of when she asked her mother which account to pay her rent into.  ""She told me put it into dad's account because that's the family account where the bills are paid from,"" she said. Mr Stanway asked: ""Your mum was so horrible, but you still went to her for money. It was your dad who was giving you money wasn't it?"" ""No,"" she replied. He continued: ""You went on holiday to Euro Disney in Paris twice, Disney World and your parents went to Morocco even though they were at each other's throats? And a holiday to Orlando is not cheap?"" Ms Nightingale said: ""It was done on a budget. Things had settled down a bit between my parents, but it wasn't great."" She told the prosecution she did not question why her mother had quit the restaurant in March 2020 despite staff being furloughed.  She also denied moving back to Kent because of the allegations against Mrs Nightingale and that she is trying to protect her father.  The trial continues.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64583031

Agriculture NI's biggest greenhouse gas emitting sector,"Agriculture remains Northern Ireland's highest-emitting sector, new figures from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs show.   The latest Greenhouse Gas Inventory details emissions in 2020.   It says agriculture is the only sector to have shown an increase since the base year of 1990, with all other sectors reducing their emissions.   Overall, Northern Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions have decreased by 24% between 1990 and 2020.   Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which include carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat from escaping into space. The emissions estimates in this report cover seven greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulphur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride. Agriculture was responsible for 28% of local emissions in 2020. Compared to the base year of 1990, that is a rise of 7%.   The other largest sectors - transport, residential, energy supply, business, and land use, land use change and forestry - have shown a decrease in that time.     Based on the projections released on Thursday, agriculture is expected to see a decrease of just 1% between 2020 and 2031. But its share of emissions is projected to rise to 32% by 2031, as ""other sectors reduce emissions at a faster rate"". The inventory estimated 2020 emissions to be 21m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e).  This was a 24% decrease on the 28 MtCO2e emitted in the 1990 base year. Over the coming years, emissions are expected to decrease year-on-year, with an overall estimated reduction of 13% by 2031. The report said the downward trend was mainly driven by the energy supply sector, as electricity generation moves away from using fossil fuels and switches to using more gas and renewable generation. It added that the business sector will contribute almost a third of (31%) the overall reduction in emissions from 2020 to 2031. From the base year to 2020, transport emissions decreased by 2%.   They are projected to decrease by 8% from 2020 to 2031, largely driven by the expected increase in electric vehicles and changes in carbon dioxide regulations for vehicles.  The sector contributed 16% of emissions in 2020, and is predicted to have a similar share (17%) in 2031. The residential sector's emissions have fallen by 23% between 1990 and 2020, with a decrease of 24% expected between 2020 and 2031. And energy supply emissions have decreased by almost half (46%), with a slower rate of reduction anticipated from 2020 to 2031. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64585225
Larne Lough gas storage caverns could aid net zero plan - study,"The team behind a project to store gas in salt caverns near Islandmagee says a year-long study indicates a fully-green gas network in NI is possible.   The project would see seven large gas storage caverns hollowed out underneath Larne Lough. The consortium behind it includes B9 Energy, Mutual Energy, Islandmagee Energy and the Net Zero Technology centre in Aberdeen. There has been a judicial review challenge to the project. It was launched by local campaigners and Friends of the Earth, who said it would damage marine life due to salt water being pumped out to create the caverns for storage.   The Ballylumford Power-to-X Phase One project was granted almost £1m by the former Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to examine maximising wind power by storing excess generation as hydrogen.  That hydrogen can then be used to support the electricity network at times of low wind renewable power generation.   The consortium carried out the study as part of the Longer Duration Energy Storage Demonstration programme run by BEIS.   Data from the study showed the on-site production, storage and distribution of hydrogen, produced through electrolysis, is possible and could help Northern Ireland achieve its legally-binding net zero targets. It involves using water to dissolve salt to create caverns for storage below Islandmagee, a process which would take about a year.   That extremely salty water would be pumped into the sea off the coast - something campaigners say will have a significant impact on priority species marine life and damage climate action goals.   There is no doubt Northern Ireland needs to make more of the renewable generation capacity it naturally has, mostly wind.   It has to be switched off when demand is low.   Storage would mean it could be released when needed, rather than lost, which would help meet our climate change targets.   Converting wind generation into hydrogen using renewably-powered electrolysis is environmentally friendly.   As the saying goes though, location is everything - the cavernous underground spaces below Islandmagee may be suited to storage, but the sea above is a protected area and home to important species.   It is a very difficult balancing act.   Consortium members say the scheme is essential for future energy security.     David Surplus, managing director of B9 Energy, said it would allow it to take full advantage of ""home-grown renewable energy sources, drive down costs and help end our reliance on volatile, expensive fossil fuels"". ""We've not only established the technical viability of having a 100% hydrogen transmission pipeline here, but also longer duration and higher capacity storage options to help bolster regular energy supplies across NI,"" he added. ""We've also created the design and specification of electrolysers and gas blending panel technologies.  ""A fully green hydrogen economy is possible, but now we need actions to make it happen and that will depend on more collaboration between government, regulators and the transport and energy sectors."" Judith Tweed, director of Islandmagee Energy, said the scheme would work with offshore wind projects. ""Large offshore wind projects are ideally suited to our coastline,"" she said. ""The production of green hydrogen from excess wind power will balance intermittent generation with existing energy demand patterns - delivering a more secure and sustainable energy for the future."" Northern Ireland now has a target of 80% renewable energy by 2030.   The financial director at Mutual Energy, Gerald McIlroy, said hydrogen would be essential to meet that.   ""Hydrogen will play an important role in the decarbonisation of the Northern Ireland economy and maintaining robust security of energy supply for consumers here,"" he added. ""Collaboration between industry and government will be key to delivering the energy transition and it is vital that policy is developed in a way that allows the potential of the hydrogen economy to be realised."" Craig Nicol from the Net Zero Technology Centre said the proposal would support jobs.   ""The manufacture, assembly and maintenance of wind farms and electrolysers will create job opportunities and future export potential as Europe invests to meet its net zero ambitions and respond to the current energy market challenges.""

Work on new Isle of Man cancer support centre to start in June,"Work on a new information and support centre for people diagnosed with cancer on the Isle of Man will begin in June, a charity has said. The Mannin Cancers Support Group has secured £1.7m for the project from several island-based charitable trusts. The centre, which will be on the Noble's Hospital site, is expected to open in late 2024. The charity's chairwoman Julie Stokes said the updated facility was ""desperately needed"" on the island. She said the current arrangement, where the information service for those given a diagnosis is based in the main foyer at the hospital, gave little privacy. The centre would see several charities and groups, including debt counselling services, brought together in one hub. Charity president David Gawne said while it would be called the cancer information service, it would ""not be restricted to cancer"" and would be a base for many of the island's smaller charities. ""The whole thing is designed to be restful, informal and away from the clinical atmosphere, away from the buzz of florescent lights, and the hustle and bustle of hospital,"" he added. The project has seen Mannin Cancers team up with Manx Care to offer support to patients. The health care provider's vice-chairwoman Sarah Pinch said a person finding they or a relative have cancer was the ""most shocking and upsetting and worrying experience"" and it was important people had one point of contact for support. ""The last thing you want to do is ring 20 people,"" she said. ""What you actually want to do is go somewhere and all of the 20 organisations that you need to connect with are in one place. ""The thought that you can then go to a centre where everyone is there just fills me with hope."" Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and Twitter?

Turkey earthquake: Before and after pictures show extent of destruction,"Two huge earthquakes and a series of aftershocks have hit Turkey, Syria and the surrounding region, killing more than 11,000 people and causing widespread destruction. The first earthquake, which struck in the early hours of 6 February, was registered as 7.8, classified as ""major"" on the official magnitude scale. Its epicentre was near Gaziantep - a city of more than two million people. The intensity of the tremors also brought down tower blocks and public buildings in northern Syria and the quake was felt as far away as Cyprus and Lebanon, both about 250 miles (400km) from the epicentre. In Turkey, more than 8,500 people are confirmed to have died, with tens of thousands injured and thousands of buildings destroyed. The first earthquake was followed by numerous aftershocks, including one quake which was almost as large as the first - registering as magnitude 7.5 - about nine hours later with its epicentre about 60 miles (100km) further north in the Elbistan district of Kahramanmaras province. On Tuesday, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared a three month state of emergency in the south-east of the country, covering 10 cities affected. In the Mediterranean port city of Iskenderun, in the province of Hatay, about 75 miles (120km) from Gaziantep, buildings and docks were reduced to rubble. A fire at the port of Iskenderun has also hampered aid efforts with many containers destroyed and those stuck in the port blocking supplies being brought in. The historic Yeni Camii mosque, in Malatya, more than 100 miles (160km) from the epicentre, was extensively damaged. Its domes collapsed, leaving it exposed to the winter sky. The mosque was destroyed by a huge earthquake in 1894 and, after reconstruction, damaged by another quake in 1964. Collapsing buildings killed more than 2,500 people across Syria. In the city of Aleppo, the ancient citadel ravaged by a decade of war has been further damaged by the quake.  In the village of Besnaya-Bseineh, a large block of residential and commercial buildings was reduced to rubble.  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64544998

Nicaraguan prisoners freed: 222 opposition figures deported to US,"Nicaragua has released 222 of the 245 opposition prisoners it was holding. The freed prisoners, who are critics of President Daniel Ortega, have been deported to the United States. The US state department welcomed the move, which it said had been made ""unilaterally"" by the Nicaraguan government.  Among those freed are opposition politicians who had planned to run against Mr Ortega in the 2021 election but who were jailed in its run-up. With his fiercest opponents in prison, Mr Ortega won a fourth consecutive term in the election. He has been in power without interruption since 2007.  Nicaraguan opposition sources said that those freed have been stripped of their Nicaraguan nationality and an official from the Nicaraguan judiciary described them as ""traitors"" who had been deported. ""The deportees were declared traitors to the homeland and sentenced for different crimes and banned perpetually from publicly serving the Nicaraguan state as well as from holding positions of public office, with their citizens' rights perpetually suspended,"" magistrate Octavio Rothschuh said. The Biden administration, which described the 2021 election in Nicaragua as ""a pantomime"", had been pressuring the Nicaraguan government to release the prisoners. The US said they had been arbitrarily detained.  The US state department said that the US had helped arrange their charter flight to Dulles airport, near Washington DC. ""Some of these individuals have spent years in prison, many of them for exercising their fundamental freedoms, in awful conditions and with no access to due process,"" it said in a statement. While there has been no official confirmation yet of who is on the flight, members of the influential Chamorro family, which has long opposed the government of President Ortega, are reportedly among those released. Cristiana Chamorro, whose mother Violeta defeated Daniel Ortega in the 1990 election, was one of those who had planned to stand against Mr Ortega in the 2021 polls. She was seen by many in the opposition as their best hope of defeating Mr Ortega. But shortly after she announced she would run for president, prosecutors accused her of money laundering. She was subsequently sentenced to eight years in prison.  Her brother, Pedro Joaquín Chamorro, who was also sentenced last year, is reportedly also among the freed prisoners.  A student opposition umbrella group, Nicaraguan University Alliance, said two of its members, Lesther Alemán and Max Jerez, were also on board the plane headed to the US. Students were at the forefront of anti-government protests which rocked Nicaragua in 2018 and the two student leaders remained vocal critics of the government led by President Ortega and his wife, Vice-President Rosario Murillo, until their arrest in 2021. Members of the Nicaraguan University Alliance said they would continue to fight for the rights of those sent to the US so that they ""can return from exile and exercise their rights fully"".

Strikes Update: How Friday 10 February’s walkouts will affect you,"On Friday, ambulance workers are going on strike in five regions in England. Unison, which is organising the action, says that staff can leave the picket lines to respond to emergency calls.  It's been a difficult week for the NHS with strikes affecting not just the ambulance service but nurses and physiotherapists as well. NHS England says the industrial action has led to 137,000 non-urgent appointments being cancelled over the last few weeks.   Staff at 150 universities in the UK are also on strike on Friday. This action is being organised by the University College Union and it says that 70,000 staff are taking part.  You can read more or watch this report about why people are taking strike action, and below you can find information on how it could affect you. Members of the Unison trade union - which represents nearly half of ambulance workers - are striking on Friday in five regions: London, Yorkshire, the South West, the North West and the North East.  The start times and lengths of the walkouts vary between ambulance services, but most will last for about 12 hours. The action will involve all ambulance employees, including call centre and control room staff, not just emergency crews. Ambulances will still be sent to the most life-threatening calls - known as Category 1, which includes cardiac arrests. But it is up to each NHS trust in consultation with the union to decide which calls are responded to.  The NHS advice is: Members of the University and College Union will go on strike again on Friday at 150 universities, continuing its action that is taking place on 18 days during February and March. Academic staff and those in other professional roles including administrators, librarians and technicians are taking part. The strike is over a range of issues, including pay, conditions and pensions. Staff walked out on three days in November, although the Universities and College Employers Association said it caused little disruption. Universities UK, which represents 140 institutions, said some universities extended coursework deadlines and rescheduled teaching. If students feel the measures put in place are not good enough, they can complain using their university's complaints procedure.

"East Kent NHS safety failures still exist after baby death review, trust says","Maternity staff at an NHS trust where dozens of babies died are not all carrying out safety checks months after a damning report, a meeting has heard. At least 45 babies might have survived with better care at East Kent NHS, an independent review found last October. Chief Nursing and Midwifery Officer Sarah Shingler told a board meeting on Thursday not all staff understood safety was part of their role. Families said it was ""horrific"" that basic safety was not being followed. After the meeting, Phil Linehan, grandfather of baby Ashton, whose case formed part of the Kirkup inquiry after he died 10 years ago, said: ""It is their job and they must do that."" He added: ""It should be every single day, everyone's job, and it's horrific that 10 years on, they are still not following the basic safety procedures."" Ms Shingler told the board all staff were fully-trained, but said: ""The challenge that we are dealing with is how do we get our staff to actually understand that safety checks are part of their professional role."" She said: ""What we can't do is constantly, 24 hours a day, be alongside each and every member of staff making sure that they are applying those principles and doing their safety checks and following guidelines robustly."" BBC South East health correspondent Mark Norman said there was visible anger in the room from some of the public attending. Ms Shingler said some staff did not see it was their responsibility to check emergency equipment before using it, and to follow guidelines when carrying out hourly patient reviews. She said the trust was unable to suspend and remove people from clinical duty because it needed to run a service. Board members heard the head of midwifery and matrons now carried out daily checks but some staff felt they were being asked to do ""over and above"". She said: ""We need to start holding people to account to do their jobs."" Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram. Send your story ideas to southeasttoday@bbc.co.uk.

Ukraine war: Zelensky takes fighter jet bid to EU leaders,"Ukraine's leader has called on EU leaders to provide fighter jets and arms for the war against Russia, on his second trip abroad since the war began. ""We have to enhance the dynamics of our co-operation, we have to do it faster than the aggressor,"" said Volodymyr Zelensky. He was earlier given a standing ovation at the European Parliament in Brussels. Several EU leaders have already stressed that a decision on warplanes would be a collective move. Some are keen to avoid having the debate being played out in public, while there is also concern about escalation and playing into Russian narratives. The Kremlin warned on Thursday that the line between direct and indirect Western involvement in the conflict was disappearing. The chief of Mr Zelensky's presidential staff, Andriy Yermak, said cryptically that the question of long-range weaponry and fighter jets had been resolved. Mr Zelensky said only that certain agreements had been made that were positive but not yet public. The UK said no decision on providing jets in the long term had yet been made but it would provide training for Ukrainian pilots on the aircraft it already had.  Poland's prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said his country could only act ""within the entire formation of Nato"", while Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the issue had to be discussed behind closed doors. European Parliament President Roberta Metsola called on EU states to consider Kyiv's request for jets quickly. In his speech to the Parliament in Brussels, Mr Zelensky repeatedly linked Ukraine to a European way of life. Ukraine has applied to join the EU and is urging the bloc's leaders to throw its weight behind a swift course to accession, which usually takes many years. ""Ukraine is going to be a member of the European Union,"" he told MEPs. Together with Europe, he said Ukrainians were defending themselves against the ""biggest anti-European force of the modern world"". That theme was repeated at the later summit with EU leaders, where he stressed that Europe could not be free without a free Ukraine. The Ukrainian leader had earlier travelled from Paris with France's Emmanuel Macron, where he had also held talks with Germany's Olaf Scholz. Before visiting Paris, he had been assured by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak that nothing was off the table. Mr Zelensky said Germany and France had the potential to be ""game-changers"" in the war. The sooner Ukraine received heavy, long-range weapons and modern planes, ""the quicker this Russian aggression will end"", he explained. Although President Macron has previously signalled some openness to providing fighter jets, Mr Scholz has not. The French leader vowed Ukraine could count on his support, with France ""determined to help Ukraine to victory and the re-establishment of its legitimate rights"". Chancellor Scholz added: ""The position is unchanged: Russia must not win this war."" Because of the 11-month long Russian invasion, Mr Zelensky rarely leaves his own country and a senior Ukrainian official said that the purpose of his trip was to obtain results. He argues that fighter jets and long-range missiles are important in addition to the Leopard 2 tanks that Western nations have recently committed to supplying. While Mr Zelensky said he had discussed the issue of combat planes in Paris, he warned there was ""very little time"" to provide much-needed weaponry. The Dutch prime minister said that many sensitive issues had to be discussed before a decision could be made on supplying fighter jets. ""The pros and cons - you have to make absolutely sure that you are not getting into an Article Five direct confrontation between Nato and Russia,"" Mr Rutte told the BBC. Moscow has repeatably warned the West against weapons deliveries since the war began, frequently threatening to retaliate against what it calls ""provocations"".   Asked by reporters in Moscow about the growing debate over sending warplanes to Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia saw it as evidence of the growing involvement of the UK, France and Germany in the conflict. ""We regret this and state that such actions of these countries lead to the escalation of tension around this conflict, prolong it and make it more painful and torturous for Ukraine,"" said Mr Peskov. Chancellor Scholz agreed only recently to allow German Leopard tanks and has warned against getting involved in a ""public bidding war"" of weapons systems for Ukraine. Mr Zelensky had earlier addressed a joint session of the UK Parliament in Westminster Hall, underlining his plea for fighter jets: ""Freedom will win - we know Russia will lose.""  Downing Street said UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was investigating what aircraft could potentially be offered, but emphasised this was ""a long-term solution"" and that training pilots could take years.

Trans prisoners in Scotland to be placed according to birth gender,"Newly convicted or remanded transgender prison inmates will initially be placed in jails according to their gender at birth, the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) has confirmed. The policy was confirmed in an urgent review which found a double rapist being placed in a women's jail did not put female prisoners at risk of harm. However, the SPS said it received ""conflicting"" details on Isla Bryson. It also called for an urgent review of admission rules for some inmates. The investigation was ordered by Justice Secretary Keith Brown in the wake of public outcry after Bryson was initially housed in segregation at Cornton Vale prison in Stirling. Bryson - who will be sentenced later this month for raping two women while she known as a man called Adam Graham - was then moved to a male wing at HMP Edinburgh. SPS chief executive Teresa Medhurs said in a letter to Mr Brown that was published alongside a summary of the Bryson case review that she had ordered an urgent review of all transgender women in Scottish prisons. She said: ""Until these reviews are complete, any transgender person currently in custody and who has any history of violence against women - including sexual offences - will not be relocated from the male to the female estate. ""In addition, any newly convicted or remanded transgender prisoner will initially be placed in an establishment commensurate with their birth gender."" Under guidance drawn up in 2014, the prison service says ""accommodation provided must be the one that best suits the person in custody's needs and should reflect the gender in which the person in custody is currently living."" However an updated SPS policy from last month stated that no newly convicted or remanded transgender prisoner with a history of violence against women would be housed in female prison facilities.  The latest change means that transgender women will now automatically go to a male prison regardless of whether or not they have previous convictions of violence against women. They will then be assessed before a decision is taken on where to place them longer-term.  However, the review says that in ""exceptional circumstances"" a transgender person with a history of violence against women could potentially be relocated to or placed in a prison which does not match their gender at birth, with ministerial approval. The SPS review made four key recommendations to the Scottish government. It found the prison service received ""conflicting and limited information"" about Bryson beyond the immediate convictions and said a ""shared justice process"" for the admission of transgender people to prisons should be considered. The SPS also called for an urgent review of admission rules and improved communications about transgender prisoners from other justice sector organisations. The report concluded SPS policy was followed in Bryson's case and said an individualised approach to risk assessments should continue.  ""It is recommended that this person centred, individualised approach, which seeks to balance the rights of the individual with the risks they pose to themselves and to others continues and is encouraged,"" the report said. Key findings and recommendations resulting from the review were published on Thursday, but Ms Medhurst said she believed it was ""not necessary"" to publish the full report due to the level of personal information it contains. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross urged the first minister to publish in full the review of the Bryson case at First Minister's Questions earlier on Thursday, with Ms Sturgeon pledging only to release the ""key findings"". Bryson was found guilty of raping two women in 2016 and 2019 in Clydebank and Glasgow before she changed gender. The review into the handling of that case by the prison service was due to be completed by the Scottish Prison Service last Friday. The SPS has also been conducting a Gender Identity and Gender Reassignment (GIGR) policy review since 2019 in response to concerns raised about welfare of people in its care. Mr Brown confirmed the new policy on admitting transgender prisoners would remain in place pending the findings of the GIGR review. In response to the Bryson report, he said: ""It is important that consideration of issues relating to the management of prisoners is measured and does not retraumatise victims or risk unintended consequences for transgender people or individuals in the care of SPS. ""All recommendations from the review have been accepted by Ms Medhurst as chief executive and will be progressed by SPS in collaboration with others as needed.  ""As confirmed in the letter, SPS will factor the learning identified from this review into its Gender Identity and Gender Reassignment (GIGR) Policy Review, which is ongoing. ""Pending the outcome of the GIGR Policy Review, measures to provide reassurance as set out in Ms Medhurst's letter will remain in place."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-64586523
UK pays EU £1.7bn to settle long-running import fraud case,"The UK has announced it will pay the European Commission a further £1.7bn (€1.9bn) to settle a long-running dispute with the EU over import fraud. In 2018, the commission sued the UK for €2.7bn, on the grounds the UK had failed to pass on the correct amount of tax for imports between 2011 and 2017. In March 2022, EU judges largely ruled against the UK in the case.  The Treasury acknowledged the money was a ""substantial sum"" but argued it would ""draw a line"" under the case. In a written statement to Parliament minister John Glen also said the government wanted to avoid building up a larger bill through ""further protracted legal proceedings"".  The BBC has contacted the European Commission to ask if it also now considers the case to be closed.  The £1.7bn figure comes on top of around £600m the UK paid the commission in June 2022 to settle the amount it considered was due at the time.  The UK officially exited the EU's legal system in January 2021, however, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) retains the power to make rulings in cases relating to how the UK applied EU law before Brexit. In 2018, the UK was accused of taking inadequate steps to prevent fraud after it was warned about the problem by the EU's watchdog, Olaf, in 2017. An investigation by Olaf found that the UK was a ""significant hub"" for fraud, whereby organised crime groups used fake invoices to undervalue goods like textiles and footwear being imported from China - many of which were destined for the black market in other parts of the EU. In its judgement, the ECJ found the UK had done too little to prevent fraud on imports, and had not given enough information to the commission. It ruled that the undervaluation of imports meant the UK had not passed on the correct share of import taxes or VAT payments. As an EU member at the time, the UK was obliged to make the payments to the Brussels-based body as part of its contribution to the EU budget. The UK disputed the amount owed, arguing that the method used by Olaf to calculate the underpayments was not appropriate. The EU judges upheld the commission's claim in March 2022, although it rejected how it calculated the final figure.  Mr Glen said: ""Whilst the UK has now left the European Union and this is a legacy matter from before our departure, the government is keen to resolve this long-running case once and for all.""

Barrow submarines: Third Dreadnought class build starts at BAE,"Work to build the UK nuclear deterrent programme's latest submarine has started. The first steel for the vessel Warspite has been cut at BAE Systems' shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. It is the third of four new Dreadnought class submarines being built to carry Trident ballistic missiles at an estimated cost of £31m. Defence procurement minister Alex Chalk said progress was ""crucial to maintaining our national security"". The milestone was a ""significant step forward"" in a programme that was ""supporting thousands of jobs and apprenticeships across the country"", he said. It would be ""protecting the UK and our allies for decades to come"", he added. The government said the programme was one of the most complex engineering projects undertaken in the UK. The four new nuclear submarines - Dreadnought, Valiant, Warspite and King George VI - will replace the Vanguard Class fleet in the early-2030s. Work will now continue on Warspite, alongside the first two boats Dreadnought and Valiant. Each is approximately 500ft (153.6m) long and contains 42km (26.4 miles) of pipework and more than 20,000 cables. Rear Admiral Donald Doull, Dreadnought's senior responsible officer, said the steel cutting was an ""important step in the ongoing delivery of the continuous at sea deterrent"". Successfully constructing the new fleet was ""a challenge that will take the determined effort of everybody with a responsibility for supporting the programme"", he said. BAE Submarines managing director Steve Timms called the steel cutting a ""really significant moment for the thousands of employees here at BAE Systems and across the submarines enterprise"".

Ian Paterson victim calls for patient safety to be prioritised,"A woman who underwent needless surgery at the hands of convicted surgeon Ian Paterson said patient safety was still not being prioritised. Paterson was convicted of 17 counts of wounding with intent in 2017 and was jailed for 20 years. Debbie Douglas, who now campaigns for his victims, said more still needed to be done following a damning report. In December, the Department for Health said it was making ""good progress"" on changes. The inquiry, published in 2020, made 15 recommendations and Ms Douglas called on health chiefs to ""get on"" with the improvements. ""It's three years and technically none of the recommendations are closed,"" she said. ""It's all around patient safety and it's not being given the priority it deserves."" Between 1997 and 2011, Paterson is known to have treated thousands of patients at Spire Parkway hospital and Spire Little Aston hospital in the West Midlands. The former surgeon, originally from Bangor, County Down, subjected hundreds of patients to needless and damaging surgery over 14 years. He also worked at NHS hospitals run by the former Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust. Last week, Spire announced it was recalling a further 1,500 of Paterson's patients after a trawl of IT systems. The 2020 inquiry had already recommended all 11,000 of his patients be recalled for review. ""We must get the recommendations closed out - not to rush it, but we've had three years,"" Ms Douglas said. ""What frustrates me, is at the end of every December we're told we will get another update, next December. ""We can't keep going on year after year, with nothing closing out."" She said it was particularly urgent for more information to be made available on the online private healthcare information network (Phin) database. Phin is designed to track the performance and fees of private consultants and hospitals, but is not due to be completed before 2026, which Ms Douglas said was ""ridiculously long"". ""The database now shows the consultant's name and very little else,"" she said.  ""It doesn't say whether they've had any suspensions... it doesn't show metrics on numbers of operations. ""Had that been around during Paterson's time, they'd have picked Paterson up as an outlier. ""For me, that's a really key thing to have, both for the hospitals to look at and for patients to look at before they make a decision on which consultant they should use."" Dr Cathy Cale, Spire's group medical director, previously said it was ""fully committed"" to implementing the 2020 review's recommendations which it had accepted.  And in December 2022, health minister Maria Caulfield said ""good progress has been made"" on making the necessary changes. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Woman's anger at 96 calls to dental phone line,"A woman from Shropshire says she gave up trying to get an emergency dentist appointment after 96 attempts to call the hotline. Liz Lewis, from Clungunford, said she was suffering with severe toothache and called the Dental Advice Line for Shropshire and Telford and Wrekin on 30 January because her own dentist was ill. But she said the phone line kept going dead, so she had to find a private dentist and pay £200 to have a tooth extracted. Shropshire Community Health NHS Trust said it could find no fault on the line, but said demand was highest on Monday mornings. Ms Lewis said she did not go to the dentist in lockdown because she felt other people had more of a need because she had false teeth, but she began to have toothache about two weeks ago. “I phoned my dentist. They only work on a Monday and a Thursday and she was off poorly and they put me in touch with dental advice [phone line] which is the phone call we made to Shrewsbury,” she said.“Anyway couldn’t get them, 96 times trying, and [I] gave up in the end and phoned all round….96 times we tried. I’ve got it written down.“It was just saying ‘we’re experiencing a very high volume of calls, thank you for your call, goodbye’. That was it is, cut off straight away.“It was over about two hours. In the end I just said.. give up, give up, let’s phone round a dentist and to be fair they were very good – although you would be for nearly £200. I had to go private in the end.""She said the tooth was now feeling ok after treatment. Ms Lewis said there were fewer NHS dentists left at her surgery now and claimed a lack of money was affecting NHS resources. ""I had got the money in my purse what about the next [person] that’s going in there that hasn’t got £84 to be looked at?"" A BBC investigation last year found nine in 10 NHS dental practices across the UK were not accepting new adult patients for treatment under the health service, with a third of 200 council areas not taking on adult NHS patients.At the time, the government said it had made an extra £50m available ""to help bust the Covid backlogs"" and that improving NHS access was a priority.In a statement the Shropshire Community Health NHS Trust said the advice line was set up in June 2022 and gave people access to urgent dental care, and would look into the issue further once it had received more details from Ms Lewis. “We have reviewed the call records for the date in question and there were no faults with the line and we received no additional complaints,"" it said. ""On calling the Dental Advice Line callers are placed in a queue to receive a clinician led triage. At peak times such as Monday morning when demand is highest, the maximum queue length may be exceeded resulting in the call ending. ""Going forward we will look at reviewing the maximum queue length applied to the Dental Advice Line, and will look at adjusting the welcome message to advise patients that at peak times of between 8am-10am there may be significant waits for care and advice.""  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cmmvj6l6786o
Donald Trump back on Facebook and Instagram,"Former US President Donald Trump is back on Facebook and Instagram after being suspended for over two years.  Mr Trump was banned from the social media platforms after the Capitol riots in 2021. The platforms' parent company Meta explained it had acted after the then-president praised people who were ""engaged in violence at the Capitol"". If Mr Trump breaks the rules again, he may be suspended again - between one month and two years - Meta has said. He was initially suspended from the platforms indefinitely, but that was revised to a two-year suspension after a review.  Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs, recently argued that the public ""should be able to hear what their politicians are saying"". He added that a review had found Mr Trump's accounts to no longer pose a serious risk to public safety. Last November, the former president announced he would be running for president again in 2024. He has 34m followers on Facebook and over 23m on Instagram. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64585429

Turkey-Syria earthquake: Thousands offer to adopt baby pulled from the rubble,"Thousands of people have offered to adopt the baby girl who was pulled from the rubble of a collapsed building in north-west Syria, following Monday's earthquake.  When she was rescued, baby Aya - meaning miracle in Arabic - was still connected to her mother by her umbilical cord. Her mother, father and all four of her siblings died after the tremors hit the town of Jindayris.  Aya is now in hospital.  ""She arrived on Monday in such a bad state, she had bumps, bruises, she was cold and barely breathing,"" said Hani Marouf, the paediatrician looking after her.  She is now in stable condition.  Videos of her rescue went viral on social media. The footage showed a man sprinting from the collapsed debris of a building, holding a baby covered in dust.  Khalil al-Suwadi, a distant relative, who was there when she was pulled to safety, brought the newborn to Dr Marouf in the Syrian city of Afrin.  Thousands of people on social media have now offered to help. ""I would like to adopt her and give her a decent life,"" said one person. A Kuwaiti TV anchor said, ""I'm ready to take care of and adopt this child... if legal procedures allow me to."" The hospital manager, Khalid Attiah, says he has received dozens of calls from people all over the world wanting to adopt baby Aya.  Dr Attiah, who has a daughter just four months older than her, said, ""I won't allow anyone to adopt her now. Until her distant family come, I'm treating her like one of my own."" For now, his wife is breastfeeding her alongside their own daughter.  In Aya's home town of Jindayris, people have been searching through collapsed buildings for loved ones.  A journalist there, Mohammed al-Adnan told the BBC, ""The situation is a disaster. There are so many people under the rubble. There are still people we haven't got out yet.""  He estimated that 90% of the town had been destroyed and most of the help so far had come from local people. Rescuers from the White Helmets organisation, who are all too familiar with pulling people out of the rubble for over a decade during Syria's civil war, have been helping in Jindayris.  ""The rescuers can end up being victims too because of how unstable the building is,"" said Mohammed al-Kamel.  ""We just pulled 3 bodies out of this rubble and we think there is a family in there that is still alive - we will keep on working"", he said.  In Syria, at least 3,162 deaths have been reported following the earthquake.  This figure doesn't include those who have died in opposition-held areas of the country.

Turkey-Syria earthquake: Bangor dog team set for survivor search,"A canine search and rescue team from Bangor, County Town, is  set to travel to Turkey on Friday to aid the search for earthquake survivors. More than 19,700 people are now known to have died after Monday's earthquakes in southern Turkey and northern Syria Ryan Gray and a colleague will be accompanied by working dogs Max and Delta, both Labradors. Mr Gray, the founder of K9 Search and Rescue, said they were going to search for people still alive in the rubble. ""The two dogs that we're bringing with us, they are purely for live people,"" he told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra.  ""We are still very much in the mindset, as are our colleagues, that it's still very much search and rescue - we've definitely not moved onto search and recovery yet. ""Although it's very cold out there, it's -3 at night-time, in the middle of that building it could be quite warm. ""We know it's raining, so if that water filters down into the building and potentially they're just getting a couple of drips, they could stay alive for really quite some time. ""The town we're going to, last night there was a 12-year-old boy pulled out alive and they're still pulling live people out."" Rescuers are continuing their search for survivors and the first UN relief convoy has arrived in northern Syria. Mr Gray said his team was eager to get to Turkey to help those efforts. ""We're itching to get there, we wish we were already there,"" he said  ""We've trained so much for this, we've put a lot of time and effort into training to go and do what we're going to do.   ""So at the minute we're just busting to get there - we want to get there, we want to try and make a difference while we can.""  He said Max and Delta, who both hold urban search and rescue licences, were capable of detecting the human scent of people trapped deeply amongst the rubble. ""They'll go out and we'll put them on to the rubble pile, the collapsed house or the collapsed apartment block or whatever it may be and they will identify to us if there is anyone still alive within that building,"" Mr Gray said.  ""The person could be incredibly deep in a void, right in the middle of it - the dogs will pick up on their human scent, they'll alert us and we'll then tell our Turkish search and rescue team to start digging.""

Press watchdog investigating Jeremy Clarkson's Meghan column,"Press regulator Ipso has launched an investigation into Jeremy Clarkson's column about the Duchess of Sussex. The watchdog received more than 25,000 complaints about the article published in the Sun Newspaper in December. Ipso is taking forward complaints from two groups, The Fawcett Society and The Wilde Foundation, which said they were affected by breaches in accuracy, harassment and discrimination. Clarkson wrote that he ""hated [Meghan] on a cellular level"" in the column. The piece became the Independent Press Standards Organisation's most complained-about article and the organisation has begun an investigation after examining the complaints it received. The Fawcett Society is a gender equality charity while The Wilde Foundation is a charity that helps victims and survivors of abuse. Clarkson, the former Top Gear presenter, co-hosts the Amazon Prime series The Grand Tour and a documentary series Clarkson's Farm. He took over hosting the ITV gameshow Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? in 2018. In the column, Clarkson wrote that he was ""dreaming of the day when [Meghan] is made to parade naked through the streets of every town in Britain while crowds chant, 'Shame!' and throw lumps of excrement at her"". Clarkson's comments were widely criticised and his daughter, Emily, said: ""I want to make it very clear that I stand against everything my dad wrote about Meghan Markle."" Clarkson, 62, later apologised and released a statement before Christmas saying he was ""horrified"" after ""causing so much hurt"". He posted a message to social media, describing a reference he made to a scene in Game of Thrones as ""clumsy"". The Sun also apologised, saying it regretted publishing the column and was ""sincerely sorry"". The Duke and Duchess of Sussex criticised the Sun's apology as ""nothing more than a PR stunt"". A spokesperson for the couple accused the Sun of profiting off and exploiting ""hate, violence and misogyny"". ""A true apology would be a shift in their coverage and ethical standards for all,"" they said. Clarkson said he emailed Harry and Meghan on Christmas Day to say his language had been ""disgraceful"" and he was ""profoundly sorry"". A spokesperson for Harry and Meghan said at the time that the article was not an isolated incident for Clarkson. Ipso said it will make public the outcome of the investigation when it is concluded.

Montreal daycare crash: Two children out of hospital as city holds vigils,"Vigils have been held across Laval, north of Montreal, as the city mourns two four-year-old children killed when a driver rammed a bus into a daycare centre. About a dozen people were injured in the crash, including six children.  Quebec's premier Francois Legault visited the site on Thursday to offer his condolences. Two of the injured children have now been released from Sainte-Justine Hospital in Montreal.  The rest are in a stable condition and are expected to recover. Residents and police remain puzzled as to why the suspect attacked the busy daycare on Wednesday morning.  The suspect, identified by police as Pierre Ny St-Amand, 51, has been arrested and charged with first-degree murder.  Mr Legault laid a wreath at the scene, and spoke to parents and staff who worked there. ""There is nothing harder than losing a child,"" Mr Legault said. ""How do we go on living? It's as serious as that."" Daycare centres across Quebec have hung white flags outside their doors in support of the victims' families. Police said they still do not know what prompted the attack. The suspect had been employed as a bus driver by the local public transit system for 10 years, and has no criminal record or incidents of note on his file.  He appeared in court via video conference on Wednesday afternoon from hospital, where he was reportedly undergoing a psychiatric evaluation.  The driver was charged with first-degree murder, attempted murder, aggravated assault and assault with a weapon or causing bodily harm.  Witnesses said the driver appeared to be acting erratically before he was stopped by bystanders.  Hamdi Ben Chaabane, an eyewitness, told reporters that the suspect exited the bus after the crash, took off his clothes and began yelling incoherently.  ""It was a nightmare. It's horrible. He didn't stop yelling. He wasn't saying words,"" he said. Mr Chaabane added that some people were helping children who were trapped underneath the vehicle's wheels and inside the daycare before first responders arrived. Quebec's minister of social services, Lionel Carmant, said the suspect had not sought out any psychiatric or mental health care in the past, according to public health records. ""There was no request (for services) pending or anything,"" Mr Carmant said.  Police had cordoned off the area around the daycare by Wednesday afternoon. Residents have since visited the site to set up a makeshift memorial.  Flags at Quebec's National Assembly had been lowered at half mast in honour of the victims, and the city of Laval has planned a vigil for victims at a local church on Thursday evening.

Watchdog warns monitoring not keeping up with surveillance tech,"Monitoring of high-tech surveillance systems is not keeping up with technology, a watchdog has told BBC News. Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner Prof Fraser Sampson also warned of an urgent need to wake up to an ""explosion"" of devices such as dashcams, drones and body-worn video. Planned legal changes would remove a key code and oversight, he said. BBC News has asked the Home Office and the police for comment. Prof Sampson was announcing the publication of his latest and probably last annual report.  If the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill becomes law, Prof Sampson's role will cease, shifting some of his responsibilities to other regulators. It would also end the Surveillance Camera Code, which governs police and local authorities in England and Wales, he warned. ""It simply abolishes what we already have,"" Prof Sampson told BBC News. ""In which case, those rules that we currently have will be gone and then there is no clear indication of what might replace them and who might be responsible for overseeing that.""  There are already gaps in oversight and a need for greater regulation in some areas, Prof Sampson suggests. His report highlights the use of automatic number-plate recognition (ANPR) cameras and concerns about ""mission creep"". Used by police to track vehicle movements, ANPR is also used to enforce low-emission zones and check cars have insurance. It is ""the largest non-military database in the UK"", Prof Sampson writes, ""15,400 traffic lanes covered by cameras submitting between 70 and 80 million reads a day"" - a critical system, the loss of which would have ""unimaginable"" consequences for policing. But he told BBC News: ""It has no specific legal underpinning.  ""There is no ANPR legislation or act, if you like. And similarly, there is no governance body to whom you can go to ask proper questions about the extent and its proliferation, about whether it should ever be expanded to include capture of other information such as telephone data being emitted by a vehicle or how it's going to deal with the arrival of automated autonomous vehicles."" And when it came to independent oversight and accountability, ""I'm the closest thing it's got - and that's nothing like enough"".  Prof Sampson also said regulation was falling behind advances in biometric surveillance - live face-recognition cameras that can match passers-by to a police watchlist or artificial-intelligence (AI) systems that can rapidly search footage for individuals. He also has reservations, in all but exceptional cases, about the potential use by police of facial-recognition technology to retrospectively identify witnesses to crime. Tracking people an algorithm says were present at an event, identifying them against a national database of images and ""inviting"" them to disclose what they heard and saw would be ""a new and somewhat sinister development"", Prof Sampson writes. And at the end of a 30-minute phone interview, he told BBC News AI's ability to scan the mass of biometric data from cameras and other sources ""is increasing not only every day - it's increased since we began this interview"". Drones capturing footage of public spaces as they operate, such as from a planned 164-mile ""drone highway"" for commercial and medical deliveries, also posed new questions for regulators, Prof Sampson said. He also said the police would often now, as a first response to a significant incident, ask for any images or footage the public may have captured themselves on their own devices.  ""Increasingly, the state needs images from the citizen,"" Prof Sampson said, and that too opened up new areas in need of regulation. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64583997

Household rates: Lisburn and Castlereagh approves 7.49% increase,"A 7.49% increase in household rates has been approved by Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council. The rates hike was agreed at a special meeting of the local authority on Thursday evening. It said it meant the average household within the council area with a capital value of £145,000, would pay an extra £2.96 per month. The council has also ratified a non-domestic district rate increase of 5.23%. LCCC said it continued to have the lowest domestic rates in Northern Ireland, although this is subject to change as more council areas prepare to announce their rates for the year ahead. On Wednesday, Mid Ulster District Council agreed to increase household rates by 7.3% while Newry, Mourne and Down District Council agreed a rise of 5.99%. Belfast City Council agreed to increase household rates by 7.99%. Fermanagh and Omagh District Council is also meeting on Thursday, with other councils yet to agree their rates for 2023-24. The money generated by rates is used to pay for public services, with bills decided against the value of a property. LCCC also outlined its plans for the year ahead, including a multi-million pound investment at Dundonald International Ice Bowl. A previous refurbishment plan was shelved in 2014. The council also said work was due to start soon on new 3G pitches in Lisburn and Carryduff. Councillor Stuart Hughes, chairman of the council's corporate services committee, said the council was ""keenly aware"" of the financial pressures faced by people. ""We have not taken the decision lightly to increase rates - but the reality is we are responsible for vital services that must be delivered,"" he said. ""The council is currently facing additional cost pressures of £7 million - driven by factors such as the unprecedented rise in the cost of utilities, waste services, materials and supply contracts as well as salary costs.""
