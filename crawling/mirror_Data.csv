Missing Nicola Bulley's partner says she 'vanished into thin air' in 'impossible dream',"It has been one week since Nicola Bulley 45, disappeared while walking her brown spaniel Willow along the River Wyre in the tight-knit village of St Michael's-on-Wyre in LancashireThe devastated partner of missing Nicola Bulley has said he can't wrap is his head around her disappearance and that it's like an ""impossible dream"".  It has been one week since the mortgage adviser, 45, disappeared while walking her brown spaniel Willow along the River Wyre in the tight-knit village of St Michael's-on-Wyre in Lancashire.  The alarm was raised when someone recognised Nicola's dog running loose and found its harness and the mum's mobile phone nearby. They phoned her daughters' school who then contacted her partner Paul Ansell. Speaking publicly for the first time, Paul told Sky: ""I don't know how I am coping. I don't want to think about that. I am just focused on the girls.""   He said: ""It's a week on as yet it seems like we are no further on. It just seems impossible like a dream. ""Every single scenario comes to a brick wall. Every single one of them. All we are doing is sitting there going round and round and round through each scenario."" He added he was focusing on looking after their two daughters and ""didn't want to think"" about how he was coping.  Speaking about the public support, he said: ""It's amazing - it's the only thing we can take. it gives us a great amount of comfort. ""We're never gonna lose hope, of course, we are not. Right now it's like she vanished into thin air. It's just insane."" Nicola's disappearance has gripped the nation as seven days on it appears there are no leads into finding out what happened.  He had previously told pals he's trying to hold it together for their daughters, aged nine and six, who ""want to go out and find mummy"".  The family friend, who did not want to be named, told The Mirror: ""I am speaking to him most days. They are close friends of ours.  ""He’s trying to be strong for the girls. They want to go out and find mummy. It’s utterly heartbreaking. He’s trying to hold on to hope that she will be found and brought home to them.  ""He’s trying to balance keeping some form of routine for the girls and then trying to find Nikki. They just desperately want her home."" ""The alternative is just too unimaginable and devastating."" Yesterday, search efforts ramped up as divers were seen going into the river. Lancashire Police also appealed for a second potential key witness to come forward, who was later identified but said she hadn't seen Nicola that morning.   Nicola was last seen shortly after dropping her daughters off at school and taking her dog for a walk.  The dog was later found wandering alone ""bone dry"" and agitated on the trail with her harness on the floor, while Nicola’s phone had been left on a bench overlooking the water, still logged into the call.   Minutes before the meeting, during which she had switched off her camera and microphone, it is understood she texted a friend about meeting up sometime this week with her kids.  Two fellow dog walkers are said to have seen her soon before her disappearance and she was ""laughing and joking"" with them. Friends and family have said Nicola's disappearance was totally out of character. It comes after Nicola's mum Dot told the Mirror this week she had also been making plans for a spa break with her sister Louise. Dad Ernest added Nicola was happy with her job and had a meeting with an important client before she went missing.  Nicola is described as white, 5ft 3ins tall, with light brown shoulder-length hair. She speaks with an Essex accent. She was last seen wearing a long black gilet jacket with a hood, black jeans and olive-green ankle wellies. Her hair was tied into a ponytail. Anybody who has seen Nicola, or has information about where she might be, is asked to call 101, quoting log 565 of January 30th. For immediate sightings please call 999.

Gary Glitter FREED after serving half his jail sentence for sex abuse of 3 girls,"The paedophile 70s star was caged in 2015 for sick child sex abuse crimes - but today the shamed singer becomes a free man after serving just half of his sentenceDisgraced pop star Gary Glitter has been freed from prison after serving half of his 16-year sentence for sex crimes. The 78-year-old paedophile, who had a string of chart hits in the 1970s, was jailed in 2015 for sexually abusing three schoolgirls. He attacked two girls, aged 12 and 13, after inviting them backstage to his dressing room, and isolating them from their mothers. His third victim was less than 10 years old when he crept into her bed and tried to rape her in 1975. Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, left HMP The Verne - a low security category C jail in Portland, Dorset - on Friday after eight years behind bars, it is understood. The glam rock singer was freed automatically half-way through a fixed-term determinate sentence. The sex offender will now be subject to licence conditions.   He will now have just three days to register his name with his local police station or run the risk being sent back behind bars. On top of this, he'll have to wear a tag and flag any relationships he has with people who have a child under the age of 18. He must also notify authorities a week in advance if he plans to go abroad and return to the UK, with officers able to deny any overseas trips. Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was at the height of his fame when he preyed on his vulnerable victims who thought no-one would believe their claims over that of a celebrity. The allegations only came to light nearly 40 years later when Glitter became the first person to be arrested under Operation Yewtree - the investigation launched by the Metropolitan Police in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.  Sentencing the singer, Judge Alistair McCreath said all the victims were ""profoundly affected"" by the abuse. He said it was ""difficult to overstate the gravity of this dreadful behaviour"" when referring to the assault on one victim, telling Glitter he was able to attack another ""only"" because of his fame. The court heard there was no evidence Glitter had atoned for his actions after he was found guilty of one count of attempted rape, one count of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 13, and four counts of indecent assault. He later lost a Court of Appeal challenge against his conviction. Glitter's fall from grace occurred years earlier after he admitted possessing 4,000 child pornography images and was jailed for four months in 1999. In 2002, he was expelled from Cambodia amid reports of sex crime allegations, and in March 2006 he was convicted of sexually abusing two girls, aged 10 and 11, in Vietnam and spent two-and-a-half years in jail. The rise and fall of glam rock star singer Gary Glitter Gary Glitter has been freed from jail after serving eight years behind bars. Below is a timeline of events in his life leading to his latest conviction for sexual offences and subsequent prison sentence.

In 1966 they have a daughter. 1972: Glitter's breakthrough single Rock And Roll (Parts 1 And 2) reaches number two in the UK and tops the US charts. This is also the year that he and his wife divorce. 1973: In what was an incredibly successful year for Glitter, he scores a string of chart hits, including I Didn't Know I Loved You (Till I Saw You Rock And Roll), I Love You Love and Do You Wanna Touch Me. In the summer he claims his first UK number one single with I'm The Leader Of The Gang (I Am). 1975: By now Glitter has sold 18 million records, but towards the end of the decade he is declared bankrupt. 1984: Glitter makes a comeback with hit single Dance Me Up. After some time away in Australia and France, he has turned to Buddhism and become a vegetarian. The song Another Rock And Roll Christmas is also released this year, reaching number 7 in the UK singles chart, and is considered Glitter's most successful song since 1975. It was also his final UK top 40 hit. November 1997: A computer engineer discovers thousands of child porn images on Glitter's laptop while servicing it. November 1999: Glitter is jailed for four months after pleading guilty to 54 offences of making indecent photographs of children under 16. January 2000: After serving two months in prison, the singer is freed and travels to Spain and then Cuba.

Criminologist details 5 possible theories behind missing Nicola Bulley's disappearance,"David Wilson, emeritus professor of criminology at Birmingham City University, has explained the five theories police will be considering during their search for missing mum Nicola Bulley A criminologist has detailed five possible theories behind the disappearance of Nicola Bulley as the search for the missing mum enters its seventh day. The mortgage broker, 45, disappeared on a dog walk last Friday morning after dropping her two daughters off at school in St Michaels on Wyre, Lancashire. Her phone, which was dialled into a work call but was on mute with the camera switched on, was found on a bench by a dog walker nearby. Police divers using specialist equipment have been seen searching the River Wyre below where Ms Bulley's items were found on the bench. David Wilson, emeritus professor of criminology at Birmingham City University, said police will consider five options when investigating the disappearance.    The theories include an accident, a suicide, a person going missing voluntarily, an abduction or murder. The criminologist told the Express: ""It is usually one of five things: there's been an accident of some kind; or a suicide; or a person voluntarily goes missing, they want to get away for a completely fresh start, a different life; they have been abducted or they have been murdered."" Lancashire Police have said they do not believe any crime has been committed and are treating the incident as a missing person inquiry.  Professor Wilson said in the first days of the investigation, detectives will have looked at Nicola's social media profiles, searching Facebook and looking at texts to find out any clues. He said: ""They will build up a picture of her, not just in terms of what is known about her in public, but things which might not be known, things she was keeping to herself."" The expert said police will also look at the missing mum's bank account usage, to see if any money was used just before she disappeared.  He added: ""There's a belief people don't just disappear into thin air. Sadly, we have had a lot of people who have disappeared into thin air. Let's hope that even after a week there might be some light at the end of this particular investigation."" Following Nicola's disappearance, her partner Paul Ansell, her parents and sister have never stopped looking for her. Her sister, Louise Cunningham, told Sky News: ""Something has got to have been missed. Somebody must know something.""  Her tearful father Ernie Bulley said Nicola's young daughters still believed it is ""only a matter of time"" before their mother comes home. He told Sky: ""There are two young children there waiting for their mummy to come back and we want her back obviously also, but if Nicola is out there, if she's watching this, then all we'd like to say is: 'Come home, contact the police, contact ourselves and we just want you back.' ""And they know that mummy's missing but they know that she's going to be coming home and everyone is looking for her, so it's only a matter of time, that they're thinking in their minds that she's going to walk through that door.""   Mr Ansell said earlier this week the family were living in ""perpetual hell"". A potential witness traced by police has said women are fearful of going out in the village where Nicola vanished. Christine Bowman, 67, had been identified as a dog walker who may have been one of the last people to see Ms Bulley before her disappearance a week ago.  But after Ms Bowman, a retired teacher, was traced following a police appeal, she said she had already spoken to officers and ""doesn't know anything"". She added: ""It has made local women fearful. If they have husbands or partners, they have been taking the dogs out instead."" Lancashire Police, who have launched a huge search operation, said that despite ""unanswered questions"", people should not ""speculate or spread false rumours"" about the disappearance.

Exact date to book your holiday so you can avoid extra £25 charge to get to the airport,"The expansion of the Ultra Zone Emission Zone from this August will cover Heathrow Airport, meaning people driving to the West London travel hub by car will face an extra costHolidaymakers heading on breaks through Heathrow Airport can book their getaways early in the summer to avoid paying an extra £25 charge. The West London travel hub will be within the expanded Ultra Low Emission Zone from August 29. That means anyone who is planning to drive to the airport will have to pay £12.50 each way, on top of parking that costs from £6 for half-an-hour drop off parking, and potentially several hundred pounds for a week. The price of a late summer holiday for drivers will be bumped up significantly by the charge, in some occasions more than the price of a bargain plane ticket abroad. One way to get around the extra fee is to book a trip earlier in the summer when the zone has not been expanded to include Heathrow.    An alternative is to travel in a low-emission car which is not covered by the payment scheme, or get to the airport by public transport, if either option is possible.  London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who is spearheading the proposals, has had pushback from many sectors of society, including from the union representatives of Heathrow workers.  Trevlyn McLeod, GMB London Region Organiser, said employees at the airport would be squeezed hard by the charge, leading some to leave their posts.  “The idea that our members ditch their cars and all jump on a local bus is absurd, the local transport infrastructure isn’t set up to support the extra carriage,"" he said.  ""Many of our members have very early starts and very late finishes, there isn’t public transport that can be used during these unsociable hours.  ""Using their cars means they, many of whom are women, can safely travel alone at times of the day when many of us are in bed asleep. “GMB understands how important it is to tackle air pollution, but the ULEZ extension will affect our Heathrow members who aren’t earning huge great salaries, who are already struggling to support themselves and their families because of the cost of living, and now face being financially penalised for going to work, having more of their limited income taken from them via another stealth tax.  “Our members are so angry about this, without some kind of concession or exemption for our low-paid members, Heathrow may once again face major ground staffing shortages.” The Mayor of London has argued that the plans are crucial if polluting traffic is decreased, to cut carbon emissions and improve air quality.  A spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: “Around 4,000 Londoners die prematurely each year due to toxic air, with the greatest number of deaths attributable to air pollution in London’s outer boroughs.  ""An estimated five million more Londoners are expected to benefit from cleaner air when the ULEZ is expanded London-wide. “No-one should have to live or work in toxic air but data collated by Imperial College London reveals that as many as 155 deaths are attributable to toxic air in Hillingdon each year.  ""Extending the ULEZ London-wide will enable millions more people to breathe cleaner air, while Heathrow is already benefitting from improved public transport links with the newly opened Elizabeth line and a new timetable on bus route A10.""

"Family of girl, 4, killed by dog say they're 'overwhelmed by love' after tragedy","A message from Alice's grieving mum and relatives was shared on a fundraiser launched yesterday to help give the ""most special and beautiful send off this little princess deserves""The family of a schoolgirl mauled to death by her pet dog say they have been “overwhelmed with love” following the tragedy. Alice Stones, four, was savaged by the crazed animal in the back garden of her home in Milton Keynes on Tuesday evening. Mum Louise Stones, 25, was overheard screaming “she’s dead, she’s dead” after witnessing the horrific attack. Friends are raising money online to support the single mum as she prepares for her daughter’s funeral. In an update on the GoFundMe, pal Grace Wenham posted a new photo of little Alice. It shows the tragic youngster blowing out candles on her birthday cake after turning four last August.   In a note accompanying the snap Grace posted a message from Alice’s grieving mum and other relatives. She wrote: ""The family … want to thank everyone who has donated, shared or sent their condolences during this horrendous time. ""Nothing has gone unnoticed and they are overwhelmed with the love felt by the community during this unthinkable tragedy."" The fund, which will pay for the funeral and living costs for Louise, now stands at nearly £3,000. It was launched yesterday to help give the ""most special and beautiful send off this little princess deserves"".  The page says: ""Sadly, on the 31st January 2023, this world lost a beautiful little 4 year old girl to a tragic, awful accident. ""We are the close friends and family of this loving mother and daughter, we are seeking support in raising money to help towards cost of funeral and living in this desperate time of need. ""Anything that can be contributed will go towards supporting mum and family getting the help and support necessary In order to make this the most special and beautiful send off this little princess deserves. ""We greatly appreciate everyone's love and condolences, please help us in allowing this family the time to grieve during this heartbreaking tragedy.  ""Thank you so much to everyone that can help in any way."" Her neighbours in the Netherfield area of the city said she had got the dog just six weeks ago. Thames Valley Police say they are still trying to determine the breed but have confirmed the animal was the family’s pet. One neighbour claimed the dog was a pitbull/husky cross which the family had got from a rescue centre. On Wednesday a friend described Louise as “heartbroken” and said her “world has fallen apart”. That evening, around 100 people attended a vigil organised at Grand Union Vineyard Church - across the road from the house.  Prayers were said for the family as people gathered, holding candles, in the darkness in a green space at the rear of the place of worship. There were moments of reflection as music was played over speakers, including Amazing Grace and Over The Rainbow. Neighbour Rita Matthews, 36, said she would see the child while walking her own daughter to school and described the youngster as a ""happy little girl, very happy"". Among the floral tributes left to the youngster, one of them read: ""Alice!! Fly high with the angels little one. The whole community will miss your smile. Our thoughts are with the whole family, especially her mum."" Donna Fuller, a ward councillor for Woughton Community Council, said the area has a ""tight-knit community, predominantly families"".  She said the vigil was to ""enable the community to come together and draw strength from each other"", adding: ""It will send a strong message to the family that we are thinking of them."" She said there is ""such a sense of shock"" and it is an ""awful situation"". Ms Fuller told gathered crowds: ""This family will need the time and space to allow them to process this tragic event and I hope that we can do that and help them in the future. ""I would ask that we support each other.  ""There is a feeling of deep sadness that we will feel as a community so I ask you to be neighbourly and I ask you to be supportive and most of all I ask you to be kind."" Giving an update earlier on Wednesday, Superintendent Marc Tarbit said that the child's family are being supported by specially trained officers. ""An investigation is currently under way to fully understand the circumstances but we currently believe that this was a tragic, isolated incident and there is no threat to the wider community,"" he said. ""Accordingly, no arrests have been made at this time. I can confirm that the dog was a family pet and was put down by police on the scene yesterday evening."" Police said there will be an increased presence of officers in the area with ""reassurance patrols during early shifts and late shifts"". You can donate to the family's fundraiser here.

Baroness Mone's £20million London home owned by offshore firms linked to tax avoidance,"A Mirror investigation has found two offshore firms which own Ultimo lingerie founder Baroness Mone's £20million London home are linked to tax avoidance schemesTwo offshore companies which own Baroness Mone’s London home are linked to tax avoidance schemes, a Mirror investigation found. A West London property described by neighbours as being used by Baroness Mone, her husband Doug Barrowman and her children from her first marriage, has been put on the market for £20million. The Ultimo lingerie founder denied owning the property and failed to reveal who is behind the two British Virgin Islands companies that do so on behalf of an offshore trust. They are registered to her husband Doug Barrowman’s Knox Group headquarters in the Isle of Man. We found they are linked to two tax avoidance schemes designed to slash tax bills for contract or agency workers. But His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs has warned such schemes “rarely work” and that anyone who uses them can end up with “big tax bills”.   The property in Belgravia is owned by Perree (PTC) Limited and Soldaldo (PTC) Limited. According to a document filed at the Land Registry, they are trustees for “the Belgravia Trust”. Baroness Mone’s press office told us: “Not that it is any of your business, Baroness Mone has no involvement in the companies you have stated and does not own a home in London you have referred to.” The house was bought for £11million in 2015. A builder involved in its refurbishment said he met Barrowman and understood the property was for his personal use. It was raided by the National Crime Agency in April 2022 as part of an investigation into PPE Medpro, which won more than £200m in government contracts after lobbying by Baroness Mone. She denies any wrongdoing.  Perree (PTC) Limited and Soldaldo (PTC) Limited are linked to two tax avoidance schemes which have been highlighted by HMRC. Maltese firm Gateway Outsource Solutions Ltd was named by HMRC in August. According to HMRC, clients enter an “employment agreement” with Gateway and then receive “ two salary payments, one paid at national minimum wage and a second as a loan or advance, which is not taxed”. A second firm in Malta, Integra Resourcing Limited, was named by HMRC in November as a promoter or enabler of another scheme. Both are “disguised remuneration” schemes – which HMRC “classes as tax avoidance”.   According to documents filed with Malta’s company registry, Gateway and Integra are owned by Soldaldo (PTC) Limited in the British Virgin Islands, having been owned by Perree before. Mary Aiston, HMRC director of counter avoidance, said: “Schemes are advertised as clever ways to pay less tax but in reality, they rarely work as the promoters promise.” Barrowman did not respond to a request for comment.

Suspect 'staged 6-hour Grand Theft Auto livestream' on night pregnant woman died,"YouTuber Stephen McCullagh, 32, is accused of murdering pregnant Natalie McNally, with a court hearing he allegedly staged a livestream making it appear he was playing Grand Theft Auto at the timeA man accused of murdering a pregnant woman staged a livestream of himself playing a video game the same night she died, a court heard. Stephen McCullagh, 32, is said to have set up the broadcast on his YouTube channel, with footage appearing to show him playing Grand Theft Auto for six hours.  Natalie McNally, also 32, was stabbed to death at her home in Lurgan, County Armagh, Northern Ireland, on December 18 last year. She was 15 weeks pregnant at the time. PSNI Detective Chief Inspector Neil McGuinness said an extensive examination of the defendant's devices by cyber experts indicates the footage was pre-recorded. He said it was played out as if it was live. The senior investigator went on to note that McCullagh, of Lisburn, told his 37,000 subscribers he was not able to interact with them due to technical issues.  Mr McGuinness told district judge Rosie Watters the defendant conceded in a police interview that the purported live stream was pre-recorded by him days earlier, reports BelfastLive. McCullagh, however, denies involvement in Ms McNally's murder. Lisburn Magistrates Court was told McCullagh was initially arrested before being rule out as a suspect by police on the basis of the alleged livestream alibi.  He was charged on Thursday. Mr McGuinness said McCullagh, who works in the local media industry, then went on to interact with the McNally family in the weeks that followed.  He claimed the accused left his phone in the home of McNally’s parents and recorded 40 minutes of audio. Ms McNally’s parents Noel and Bernie and brothers Declan, Niall and Brendan were in court as this evidence was outlined. McCullagh watched proceedings via video link from a police custody suite. He was remanded in custody to appear before Craigavon Magistrates’ Court on February 24 via video link.",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/suspect-staged-6-hour-grand-29120086
Mason Greenwood attempted rape charges dropped as Man United future remains uncertain,"England footballer Mason Greenwood will not face trial over an alleged sex attack with all charges against the Manchester United player, including attempted rape, dropped by the CPS England footballer Mason Greenwood will not face trial over an alleged sex attack.  All charges against the player, including attempted rape, have been dropped. The CPS said it was due to “the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material that came to light”.  But his career at Manchester United – where he earns close to £100,000 a week – still hangs in the balance.  Police yesterday announced that the charges – attempted rape, controlling and coercive behaviour and assault – had been dropped. All the allegations concerned the same young woman. The CPS said: “A combination of the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material that came to light meant there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. In these circumstances, we are under a duty to stop the case.   “We have explained our decision to all parties. We would always encourage any potential victims to come forward and report to police, and we will prosecute wherever our legal test is met.” Greenwood, 21, said: “I am relieved this matter is now over. I would like to thank my family, loved ones and friends for their support.” United said that after learning of the CPS decision the club “will now conduct its own process before determining next steps”. Bradford-born Greenwood has been suspended on full pay by the club since his arrest in January last year. He was questioned by police after disturbing images and audio clips were posted on social media. He was charged in October.  A provisional trial date was set for November this year.  Chief Supt Michaela Kerr, at Greater Manchester police, said: “The investigation team…understand the rationale for the discontinuation of proceedings, and that this decision has not been taken lightly.  ""I would like to reiterate GMP’s commitment to investigating allegations of violence against women and girls. If you feel you are a victim, please don’t let this case put you off asking for help.”  Commenting on the justice system, Farah Nazeer, of Women’s Aid, which campaigns to end domestic abuse, said yesterday: “Only one in five women report domestic abuse to police, highlighting the severe lack of trust they have that they will be taken seriously. “We’ll continue to push for evidence-led prosecutions which reduce the need to rely on the victim’s testimony. “This is crucial because of the high number of domestic abuse cases that are dropped [as] the victim no longer feels able to support a prosecution, often due to the severe barriers and safety implications of taking an abuser to court.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/mason-greenwood-attempted-rape-charges-29120382
Nicola Bulley's daughters 'want to help find mummy' as dad 'tries to stay strong',"Missing dog walker Nicola Bulley disappeared last Friday morning while taking her brown spaniel Willow along the River Wyre in the tight-knit village of St Michael's-on-Wyre in LancashireThe partner of Nicola Bulley has confided in a friend that he's ""trying to be strong for the girls"" as she's been missing for a week.  The mortgage adviser, 45, disappeared last Friday morning while walking her brown spaniel Willow along the River Wyre in the tight-knit village of St Michael's-on-Wyre in Lancashire.  The alarm was raised when someone recognised Nicola's dog running loose and found its harness and the mum's mobile phone nearby. They phoned her daughters' school who then contacted her partner Paul Ansell. The 44-year-old has told friends he's trying to hold it together for their daughters, aged nine and six, who ""want to go out and find mummy"".   The family friend, who did not want to be named, told The Mirror: ""I am speaking to him most days. They are close friends of ours. ""He’s trying to be strong for the girls. They want to go out and find mummy. It’s utterly heartbreaking. He’s trying to hold on to hope that she will be found and brought home to them. ""The alternative is just too unimaginable and devastating.  ""He’s trying to balance keeping some form of routine for the girls and then trying to find Nikki. They just desperately want her home."" Nicola's disappearance has gripped the nation as seven days on it appears there are no leads into finding out what happened. The pal told the Mirror that they met Nicola through Paul and said she was ""lovely"" and ""do anything for anyone"".  They said: ""I’m a school friend of Paul’s. Met her through him. We adored her straight away. She’s kind and would do anything for anyone. Everyone that meets her comments on how lovely she is.  ""She adores her girls. She is a real homemaker and loves to spend time with her family. They love taking walks with the dogs.  ""She is always cooking, making things with the girls. She takes them to school, and outside school activities. She is involved in church events with school.  ""She adores animals. She is so sweet-natured."" They said she hadn't seen the family in a few months but said everything seemed great. They added: ""Her career was going well. ""She had taken time out to raise her daughters but recently re-skilled herself in the mortgage industry and got back into it.  ""She adores her parents and sister. She is just so lovely. She would not leave her family. It makes no sense at all."" Yesterday, search efforts ramped up as divers were seen going into the river. Lancashire Police also appealed for a second potential key witness to come forward, who was later identified but said she hadn't seen Nicola that morning.  Nicola was last seen shortly after dropping her daughters off at school and taking her dog for a walk.   The dog was later found wandering alone ""bone dry"" and agitated on the trail with her harness on the floor, while Nicola’s phone had been left on a bench overlooking the water, still logged into the call.   Minutes before the meeting, during which she had switched off her camera and microphone, it is understood she texted a friend about meeting up sometime this week with her kids. The family friend said they grew up in the area and said the community is really ""shaken"" at Nicola's disappearance. They also shared their fears that someone else must be involved. They said: ""It’s a very typical reaction for the community to come together like that.  ""It’s really shaken everyone at how someone can just disappear with seemingly no trace. ""I believe that there has to be another person involved. She just would not leave her family or leave the dog free to get into any danger.""  Two fellow dog walkers are said to have seen her soon before her disappearance and she was ""laughing and joking"" with them. Friends and family have said Nicola's disappearance was totally out of character.

Parents’ fury as school tells girls to ask for ‘red card passes’ while on period,"Girls at Penrice Academy, Cornwall, have been told they must use red hall passes when on their periods to allow access to toilets, sparking the ire of many parentsFurious parents have slammed a school which has told girls they must use a red hall pass while on their period to allow them access to toilets. Penrice Academy, in Cornwall, has introduced new procedures for pupils’ use of the facilities during class time. As part of the new rules children are not allowed to use the bathroom during lessons and girls must carry a red card pass when they are on their period. The school has defended its policy and insists it would not prevent pupils from going to the loo if they really are in need. Many parents have shared their dismay at the new rules, Cornwall Live reported.  One said: “Any human, child or adult should be allowed to use the toilets at any time.   “They are hardly going to 'please Sir I have a touch of diarrhoea'. Or please may I use the loo my periods have started'. ""If schools are all about care and nurturing children, some of these controlling and archaic rules need rethinking. “Children and young adults have a desperate need to be embarrassed. Penrice academy and all the other schools need to rethink what's best for the child."" Another added: “They should know by now that these rules are singling students out and will not be approved of by anyone. “Red passes are a ridiculous idea. This is a complete invasion of young girls' privacy."" Another said: “Let's give them a red card the same colour as blood and single out the girls on their periods which is a natural cycle of life. “That shouldn't be ruled by anyone but the individual at any age.""  Another concerned parent added: ""The issuing of a red card is neither sensible or a reasonable response. “It clearly singles out these young people who already have many pressures, this is an invasion of their privacy. It is likely to and will cause embarrassment. “It may lead to these young people being teased or worse. “Quite clearly the general consensus is that this practice needs to stop and must stop."" The school said 'red card period passes' can be requested ahead of time for pupils to keep in their bags and use when required. Lucy Gambier, headteacher of Penrice Academy, defended the policy saying: ""Penrice students are welcome to use the toilet facilities at the start of the day, in between lessons, at breaktimes, lunchtimes, and at the end of the day. “This equates to six opportunities throughout the day, spaced no more than 75 minutes apart at any one time.   “This policy is in place to maximise learning time and minimise disruption to teaching. “There are, of course, exceptions such as medical conditions and unexpected arrival of periods; toilet passes can be obtained by students who require flexibility or peace of mind.” James Hammersley, the assistant headteacher, added: ""We understand that girls cannot always plan for the arrival of their periods which may take place during lessons. “With this in mind, girls can request red period pass cards via their tutors which they can keep in their bags to use when required. “This system has always proven successful, and many Penrice girls already know of and make use of the cards. “Crucially, this system operates on trust, and is monitored to ensure the cards are used appropriately.""

Missing Nicola Bulley: Mystery woman in red coat tells police she didn't see her,"The woman photographed, 68-year-old Christine Bowman, said she was baffled by the appeal as she had already spoken to police on the day of Nicola's disappearance and “doesn’t know anything” A dog walker tracked down by police investigating the disappearance of Nicola Bulley has told officers that she ""doesn't know anything"". Mum-of-two Nicola, 45, disappeared a week ago as she walked her dog Willow along the River Wyre in the town of St Michaels, Lancashire. The mortgage adviser's mobile phone as well as the lead and harness for her springer spaniel, Willow, were found on a bench close to the river. Yesterday, Lancashire Police issued CCTV of a woman wearing a red coat who they believed could be a potential witness in the case. The force later confirmed that she had been identified. But the woman photographed, 68-year-old Christine Bowman, told the Mirror she was baffled by the appeal as she had already spoken to police on the day of the disappearance and “doesn’t know anything”. Police later confirmed she had been identified.   The retired teacher told how some female villagers have since become wary of walking the same route alone. She said: “It has made local women fearful. If they have husbands or partners, they have been taking the dogs out instead.”  The comments come after Nicola's family said they would do anything to have her back with sister, Louise Cunningham, telling Sky News: ""Something has got to have been missed. ""Somebody must know something. People don't just vanish into thin air.""  Her tearful father Ernie Bulley said Nicola's young daughters still believed it is ""only a matter of time"" before their mother comes home. He said: ""There are two young children there waiting for their mummy to come back and we want her back obviously also, but if Nicola is out there, if she's watching this, then all we'd like to say is 'come home, contact the police, contact ourselves and we just want you back'. ""And they know that mummy's missing but they know that she's going to be coming home and everyone is looking for her so it's only a matter of time, that they're thinking in their minds, that she's going to walk through that door."" Yesterday, police divers concentrated on a small stretch by the bench where the mortgage adviser’s phone was found.  In the morning, fire crews had used a 20ft probe camera to look underwater at the banks and river bed. Soon afterwards, the underwater police unit was sent out and were seen diving in the same area for several hours. Louise added: ""There has got to be somebody who knows something and all we are asking is, no matter how small or big, if there is anything you remember that doesn't seem right then please reach out to the police. ""Get in touch and get my sister back.""  Ms Bulley's partner, Paul Ansell said earlier this week the family were living in ""perpetual hell"". Police say Ms Bulley was last seen at 9.10am last Friday, while walking her dog and she had logged on to a work Teams call, which ended at 9.30am with her still logged on. Ms Bulley and her family are originally from Essex but moved to Lancashire around 25 years ago. Lancashire Police have said they do not believe any crime has been committed and are treating the incident as a missing person inquiry.

Top mafia hitman arrested after 16 years on the run posing as a pizza maker,"Edgardo Greco was wanted in Italy to serve a life sentence for the murders of two brothers which were ""part of a 'mafia war'… that marked the early 1990s"" in ItalyA man believed to be a part of Italy's most powerful mafia organisation has been discovered working as a pizza chef and arrested after 16 years on the run.  Edgardo Greco, 63, is suspected of belonging to the notorious ’Ndrangheta, which is a hugely powerful mafia organisation in Calabria, southern Italy.  An Interpol — the international police organisation based in Lyon, France — statement said French police, with the help of Italian authorities, arrested the murderer in south-eastern Saint-Etienne, where he had lived since 2014. At one point the ""dangerous fugitive"" ran an Italian restaurant under an alias for three years, according to French prosecutors.   Mr Greco was wanted in Italy to serve a life sentence for the murders of Stefano and Giuseppe Bartolomeo in 2006 and has been accused of attempted murder in another case. The two murdered brothers were beaten to death with a metal bar in a fish shop in Calabria and Interpol said the killings were ""part of a 'mafia war' … that marked the early 1990s"" in Italy. Their bodies were never found and are believed to have been dissolved in acid. The 'Ndrangheta is one of the world's most powerful cocaine trafficking organisations and is seen as the largest threat among organised crime syndicates. Mr Greco’s arrest came a week after Italian police said it had dismantled a ’Ndrangheta mafia ring dominating a large area of southern Calabria and seized assets exceeding €250m (£223m). According to documents seen by Agence France-Presse, Mr Greco used the alias Paolo Dimitrio and also worked in other Italian restaurants in the city.  A Facebook account for his restaurant, Caffe Rossini Ristorante, which now appears to have been closed down, shows local press covered its opening in 2021. ""Paolo Dimitrio opens the restaurant of his dreams,"" said one headline. “No matter how hard fugitives try to slip into a quiet life abroad, they cannot evade justice forever. Dedicated officers around the world will always ensure that justice is served"", Jürgen Stock, Interpol's Secretary General said. His arrest is the second of a mafia boss this year. In January, Matteo Messina Denaro was arrested at a private clinic in Palermo, Sicily, after 30 years on the run. The 60-year-old, who was considered the region's Cosa Nostra top boss even while a fugitive, was captured at the clinic where he was receiving treatment for an undisclosed medical condition.  He had previously been tried in absentia and convicted of dozens of murders, and is now expected to face multiple life sentences.

"Martin Lewis asked by dad earning £30,000 if being on benefits 'would be better'","The dad of two told the Money Saving Expert that he and his partner have eight-month-old twins and are currently facing a staggering £3,000 a month bill for childcareA dad who earns £30,000 a year asked Martin Lewis if he would be ""better off on benefits"" on the recent Martin Lewis Money show episode.   The father of two named Michael told the Money Saving Expert that he and his partner have eight-month-old twins and are currently facing a staggering £3,000 a month bill for childcare.  He said: ""We have eight-month-old twins and simply can't afford to go back to work.  ""Childcare costs for five days per week are coming in at over £3,000 a month. I earn £30k per year but this is not enough to support our family. ""Is there any help available to us or are we, I hate to say it, better off quitting our jobs and going on benefits?""   Michael did not say what his work was and it was unclear if he has already been forced to leave his job or what is his partner's situation is. Martin noted viewers on Tuesday the ""political issue"" in the country around the level of childcare available to parents. He added: ""I know it is a debate across different parties of government and within different parties of government. ""And of course we want people in our economy to be able to go out to work and have their children looked after."" Answering Michaels's question, the Money Saving Expert did explain that there was childcare available however he wasn't able to confirm if the father would qualify. Martin said: ""I have to be honest, I cannot tell you if you will qualify but follow the three steps I'm going to give you through.""  The Money Saving Expert first highlighted that around 800,000 people were missing out on childcare help in the UK.  First, if you have a three or four-year-old, you should see if you can get up to 30 hours of free childcare a week at a nursery.  The exact number of hours you get differs depending on your income, whether you, and your partner, work, and where you live.  If you are not eligible for this, Martin said if you pay for childcare and your family's income is below £40,000 then you should do a benefits calculation online to check whether you are entitled to Universal Credit support.  If you're already on Universal Credit and you are not getting childcare money, you could be due up to 85% of the childcare costs and if you're on Tax Credits, you could be due up to 70% of your childcare costs. You can get up to a maximum of £646 a month for one child, and £1,108 a month for two or more children, under the age of 16 years.   Martin added that if you have tried both of those, there is the Government's Tax-Free Childcare Scheme. If you are eligible for the scheme, Martin explained that you could get up to £500 tax-free every three months, which is up to £2,000 a year, for each of your children to help with the costs of childcare. This goes up to £1,000 every three months, which is up to £4,000 a year if a child is disabled. Regarding eligibility, Martin said: “To get this, you must be working an average of 16 hours or more per week, you can be self-employed, and if you’re a couple, you must both be working 16 hours or more and the maximum you can both earn is £100,000."" Martin explained that it didn't matter what sort of childcare you choose, the only important thing is that your provider is registered with the Tax-Free Childcare scheme, as well as with a regulator such as Ofsted, the Early Years Register or the Childcare Register. If you are eligible to get the cash, you'll need to set up an online account for your child on the Government's website. Martin added: ""Michael I hope some of that works for you, I can't promise that it will but it's worth exploring all these options.""

Man bullied for being 'the only gay kid' turns life around to become award-winner,"A man who says he was bullied for being the 'only gay kid' and often got into trouble with the police has grown up to become an award-winning hairdresser after a 'lightbulb moment' changed his lifeA man who says he was bullied as a child for being the ""only gay kid"" has spoken of the moment he turned his life around becoming a hairdresser. Aaron Jones said he was a ""rebel and get into trouble all the time with the police"" before a ""lightbulb moment"" that turned him into an award-winning hairdresser. Merseysider Aaron, 31, said it was when he was confronted with a juvenile probation centre that he became interested in being a hairdresser.  He said: ""When I was a teen I was the only gay kid where I was from. I was constantly bullied for that. ""It led me to rebel and get in trouble all the time with police. Eventually, I was sent off to a probation centre and there I met a woman and she pushed me into hairdressing and then shoved me into a hairdressing college. ""It was a lightbulb moment. I realised there was more to life than just going out and being a nightmare.""  After setting up a salon in 2017, Aaron went on to 'Best Hairdresser' at the National Beauty Awards. His five-star salon comes highly rated.   Of the award, Aaron, from New Brighton told the Liverpool Echo: ""I've been to a few awards ceremonies with other people and if you're sat by the door it's probably a bad sign. I was basically sat on the door out at this one. ""I was just listening along to what was being said and missed my name being read out and I was just clapping as they said my name not realising it was me who won."" The road there was not an easy one. Aaron was 17 when he began doing an apprenticeship in hairdressing, but this went south when he lost a job at one of the salons he was working at. He added: ""I just didn't turn up to work one morning. That was the start of me bouncing from salon to salon really."" Eventually, he found a place he was comfortable with after becoming close with the manager. He later went on to be the manager at the same salon before leaving to take charge of a nightclub.  He added: ""I found a place and became close with the manager. I later became a manager there. ""One day it became too much and I wanted to give it all up and I decided to leave. I went to manage a nightclub for a year, but always kept a finger in the pie. ""But eventually I missed the face to face interactions as you can barely hear people in a nightclub. ""All the salons I've worked in I've never really found my spot or my place. It reached a point where I just thought lets go and do it myself. ""With savings I had and some help from family I managed to set up a salon, in just nine days from having the idea as well, after I met a woman who wanted to give up her lease for a shop ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/man-bullied-being-the-only-29122388
Crossbow man guilty of TREASON after threatening to kill Queen in Windsor break-in,"Jaswant Singh Chail, 21, pleaded guilty to three charges, including an offence under the Treason Act, during a hearing at the Old Bailey. He was also charged with making a threat to kill the QueenA man has admitted trying to harm the Queen after being caught in the grounds of Windsor Castle with a loaded crossbow. Jaswant Singh Chail, 21, was also charged with making a threat to kill the Queen and having a loaded crossbow, an offensive weapon, in a public place. He pleaded guilty to three charges, including an offence under the Treason Act, during a hearing at the Old Bailey on Friday. The most serious charge under Section Two of the Treason Act said that ""on December 25, 2021 at Windsor Castle, near to the person of the Queen, you did wilfully produce or have a loaded crossbow with intent to use the same to injure the person of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, or to alarm her Majesty.""   The defendant had been detained on Christmas Day in 2021 close to the Queen's private residence, where she was at the time. Chail, who was then unemployed but previously worked for a branch of the Co-op supermarket, was spotted in the grounds of Windsor Castle at about 8.10am. It is understood he had scaled the perimeter of the grounds with a nylon rope ladder some two hours before.  He was said to be wearing a hood and mask and was carrying a crossbow loaded with a bolt, with the safety catch off and ready to fire. He told a police protection officer ""I am here to kill the Queen"" before he was handcuffed and arrested. It was alleged that Chail had previously applied to join the Ministry of Defence Police and the Grenadier Guards, in a bid to get close to the royal family.  Prosecutors allege he sought revenge against the establishment for the treatment of Indians and had sent a video to about 20 people claiming he was going to attempt to assassinate the Queen. The Supersonic X-Bow weapon he was carrying had the potential to cause ""serious or fatal injuries"", according to the prosecution. Chail, from Southampton, Hampshire, entered his guilty pleas before senior judge Mr Justice Jeremy Baker by video link from Broadmoor hospital.  The allegations were not being treated as a terrorism offence but had been dealt with by the Counter-Terrorism Division. In 1981, Marcus Sarjeant was jailed for five years after pleading guilty under the 1842 Treason Act, which makes it an offence to assault the Queen, or have a firearm or offensive weapon in her presence with intent to injure or alarm her or to cause a breach of peace.  He had fired blank shots at the Queen while she was riding down The Mall in London during the Trooping the Colour parade in 1981. The last person to be convicted under the separate and more serious 1351 Treason Act was William Joyce, also known as Lord Haw-Haw, who collaborated with Germany during the Second World War.

You could be paying £250 more for your energy due to obscure rule - how to check,"This quirk in determining the price of electricity has meant UK households have overpaid by up to £7.2billion throughout 2021 and 2022 according to the new researchThe average home in the UK is paying £250 more for their electricity bill than they should because of one little-known energy industry rule.  Under existing rules, energy suppliers pay the highest price for wholesale electricity no matter how it is made. According to the climate non-profit group Carbon Tracker Initiative (CTI), this quirk in determining the price means UK households overpaid by up to £7.2billion throughout 2021 and 2022. A report released by the group this week explained how the for electricity by supply companies such as Eon, OVO and SSE is determined by the result of a bidding process and generators impose the highest bid on all, regardless of how the electricity is produced.  This price is then passed on to household electricity bills.   Initially, electricity prices were linked to gas-powered generation because it was the cheapest, but this is no longer the case. Gas-fired power stations are the most expensive way to generate electricity, but only makeup around 40% of all electricity used by UK homes according to the CTI.  This is due to the development of more efficient nuclear energy, the harnessing of renewable energies, and rising gas prices.  The think tank said if the ""average price"" was used instead, then around £250 could be saved per household in the UK.   Predictions by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) estimate that the cost of gas turbines could be £85 per megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity generated in 2025.  Compared to this, offshore wind is expected to cost significantly less at around £57/MWh and onshore wind at £46/MWh. Solar power is predicted to cost around £44/MWh and nuclear energy is expected to cost around £73/MWh. However, according to the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) when it's windy and sunny enough to meet the demand for electricity through renewables, the wholesale cost drops to close to zero. The current system has also meant that renewable energy companies have had to sell electricity at prices far higher than it costs to produce it.  The Government has announced a ""major review"" into the UK's electricity market and will look at ways of reducing the cost for consumers in the long term.  BEIS has also announced a consultation on changes to the wholesale electricity market which will aim to stop gas prices from setting the price of electricity that is produced by cheaper renewables.

Inside creepy abandoned home of doctor with ghostly figures and family grave in yard,"Eerie pictures captured by an urban explorer show an Alabama house lost in time, as it is rumoured that the homeowner, Dr. David Elias Morgan, haunts the family homeCreepy images of an abandoned family home of a doctor that kept ghostly figures have been revealed.  An urban explorer has taken haunting pictures of the former home of Dr. David Elias Morgan, which show a creepy porch swing in the garden, a perfectly preserved kitchen and a bundle in the middle of a room. What's even more spooky is that the family are also buried on the property - including Dr Morgan and his wife Minnie - as their headstones sit overgrown in the back yard. Leland Kent, an urban explorer, who is known online by his alias Abandoned Southeast, captured the photos of the derelict home in Alabama.   Dr Morgan, who was born in Wales in 1864, moved to Alabama after he travelled to the States in the hope for a better life. According to Abandoned Southeast, the doctor began constructing the home in 1904, after purchasing the materials of a partially burned house.  The doctor used these materials to construct what is known today as the Morgan-Curtis house. In 1914 he decided to convert the second floor of his residence into a sanatorium for the treatment of out-of-town patients.  He saw just four patients at a time upstairs. As a doctor, he treated all sorts of ailments from the common cold to delivering babies. The eerie pictures of the home are show how Dr Morgan would take almost anything as payment for the services rendered. In fact, one patient paid him in paintings, several of which are seen still hanging on the wall upstairs. Meanwhile, another picture shows an abandoned lazy boy in the living room of the creepy house, with the fireplace boarded up.  Another snap taken by the urban explorer shows a solitary rocking chair positioned to look over into the garden through the large panel glass windows. And on the theme of chairs, a sofa-looking chair can be seen left out on the balcony, overlooking the overgrown garden that resembles a jungle. Dr. Morgan and his wife had four children together; John Pierpont, William Earl, Ruth Morgan, and Minnie Alice, but sadly neither of the sons survived into old age. In 1934, John P. was killed at the age of 32 when he was run over by a train. William Earl died from ingesting some bad alcohol.  The following year, on January 15, 1935, Dr. David Elias Morgan passed away at the age of 70. The doctor and his family along with various members of the Morgan and Curtis families are buried in the Morgan Cemetery on the property.  While one picture shows a singular grave, there are roughly two dozen tombs in the cemetery. However, the doctor's legacy lives on as it is rumoured that he now haunts the family home. Stories that date back more than forty years suggests that a man dressed in all black has been seen on the property, with a woman in white also seen on the grounds.  When Dr Morgan's great-grandson began renovating the property, he hired a painter who saw a spectral woman in what might have been white nurse's clothes on the second-floor balcony. And 1999, a house painter is said to have photographed this unearthly woman on the second-floor balcony. Speaking about the creepy home on his blog, Leland said: ""In 1983, the property was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The upstairs was converted into two apartments and remained occupied until about five years ago.  ""In 2000, the Morgan-Curtis House was sold to Dr. Morgan's great-grandson, Steve Abbott. Today, the Morgan-Curtis House and 11 acres remain in the family and are cared for by Dr. Morgan's great-great-grandson and his siblings. ""For most of its existence, the house was always maintained. Once vacant, Steve Abbott decided to take on the task of restoring the property. ""Depending on who you ask, Dr. Morgan may still keep an eye on his house."" The urban explorer explained that rumours and stories about the ghostly doctor still wondering around the halls are rife today.  He said: ""Stories dating back more than forty years from various family, friends, and neighbours detail accounts of a woman in white or a man dressed in black seen on the grounds. ""Once a neighbour saw a woman in what resembled a white nurse's outfit or an old gown standing in the driveway. In 1999, a house painter photographed the same woman standing on the second-floor balcony. ""When Steve Abbott began renovating the old family home, he hired several painters to work downstairs. One day he came by to check on them, and they asked him about someone walking around upstairs and thought it was him."" Leland continued: ""When Steve told them that he just got there, they refused to enter the house and quit. A second painter was hired and working upstairs when he saw a man in a black outfit walk down the hallway. ""He turned to speak to whoever he saw, and the man vanished. After this occurrence, the second painter also quit. The family is continuing to work to restore the property."" Today, the home remains within the Morgan family, but a lot of restoration work is needed to bring the property back to its former glory.

'Vile' Brit TikTok star slammed for mocking disabled kids and calling them 'vegetables',"Kerrie Baker and her partner posted a livestream in which they mocked disabled children, pulling faces and laughing as they called them 'vegetables' and told people who disagreed to 'f*** off'A British influencer has been slammed for a “vile” TikTok in which she mocked disabled children and called them “vegetables”. Kerrie Baker, known as Kerrie Essex on TikTok, made the horrific comments during a livestream with her partner Danny. The two were discussing abortion when the conversation turned to disabled children. It was then Kerrie began to pull faces to mock severely disabled youngsters before they both burst into fits of laughter throughout the video. She said: ""Unless you've not consented or your baby is literally going to be a vegetable and have no life then fine. A vegetable, yeah, you know what I'm saying - can't walk, can't talk, just sat there. Like they put them on live and they're just sat there like that...."" She followed this by pulling another face in an attempt to mock disabled children as Danny continued to laugh.    Kerrie laughed as well before telling her viewers “'if you don't like it, f*** off”. Several times throughout the video Kerrie made faces as the pair laughed. Following wide condemnation for their disgraceful comments, a petition was launched to try and get TikTok to remove her account - which had amassed over 500,000 followers. The petition was launched on Change.Org by user Donna Willis and it received over 8,000 signatures in just a matter of days. The petition says: ""Kerrie is a female on TikTok with a huge following. She was on live abusing disabled children, calling them cabbages, and ugly, hanging b*******, and no one should bring them into the world. ""She then went on to hysterically laugh about her mimicking of disabled kids. This is disgusting and it has affected millions of people on TikTok.""  A number of people on Facebook then began sharing a message urging others to sign the petition.    It said: ""This vile person who has many accounts - Kerrie Essex/Kerrie Essex Baker has over 500k followers on TikTok and nearly 100k on Instagram and believes it's acceptable to mock disabled children.  ""This is a mother, and one of her children is autistic. She has called them cabbage children, vegetables, ugly and said she would give it up for adoption if she had a severely disabled child. ""We cannot stand back and let people like this have a large platform and get away with such disgusting comments."" After the backlash the two desperately tried to backpedal their horrific comments in an apology video. In the video Kerrie claimed she was “utterly sorry” and added it “takes a lot” for her to apologise.  She added: ""A wise woman told me today 'it doesn't make you strong being a hard face, it makes you strong owning your s*** and being sorry. ""I genuinely want to say I'm so sorry for how many people I've affected. I've spoken to parents today and I'm genuinely sorry at the way I made people feel. Every single thing that I've said, that was vile and horrible."" She went on to claim that her comments “ain’t the person” she is. She added: ""You don't have to forgive me. I want you to go to bed tonight knowing I'm genuinely sorry for what I've said."" Danny also posted a video in which he apologised, saying: ""It should have been worded different on the other video and Kerrie has apologised for that, we never meant to cause anyone any hurt or upset."" The original video has since disappeared from the platform and Kerrie's TikTok and Instagram accounts can no longer be accessed. It is not clear whether she took them down herself or if they were deactivated by the social media firms. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/vile-brit-tiktok-star-slammed-29120435
Nicola Bulley texted her friend a significant message minutes before going missing,"Mum-of-two Nicola Bulley, 45, disappeared while walking her springer spaniel along a river towpath in St Michaels on Wyre, Lancashire, after dropping her daughters at schoolA friend of missing mum Nicola Bulley has told the Mirror what she said in a text message believed to have been sent minutes before she vanished. The mortgage broker, 45, disappeared on a dog walk last Friday morning after dropping her two daughters off at school in St Michaels on Wyre, Lancashire.  During the seventh day of searching, police have today cordoned off part of the route as divers scour the water. It is feared she fell into the river and was dragged downstream - though no conclusive evidence has been released.   She had taken springer spaniel Willow along a nearby towpath next to the River Wyre from around 8.45am - and is understood to have signed into a work conference call close to 9am. The dog was later found wandering alone ""bone dry"" and agitated on the trail with her harness on the floor, while Nicola’s phone had been left on a bench overlooking the water, still logged into the call. Minutes before the meeting, during which she had switched off her camera and microphone, it is understood she texted a friend about meeting up sometime this week with her kids. A pal who lives in the village - who did not wish to be named - said: “She booked a playdate, 8.57, she sent a text message to a friend whose mortgage she had just recently signed off on to arrange for the girls to go for tea this week.”  The friend said this indicates she had no intention of voluntarily disappearing. “You wouldn’t have done that if you were going to get up and go missing,” she added. She said the information was revealed during a meeting at the village hall on Sunday morning at around 10.30am before residents headed out on their first mass organised search. Nicola's partner Paul is understood to have been at the meeting.  As previously reported, police advised the group to search upriver in a pincer movement. In the afternoon, a second search of locals set out, with around 100 participants, which included the headteacher from the primary school. Two fellow dog walkers are said to have seen her soon before her disappearance and she was ""laughing and joking"" with them. It comes after Nicola's mum Dot told the Mirror yesterday she had also been making plans for a spa break with her sister Louise. Dot, 72, said: ""Louise had just booked Ribby Hall because they both had spa vouchers, she had just sent Nicola the night before the treatments.  ""Louise booked it on Friday morning and sent it to Nicola but she never got back to her. They are very close."" Dad Ernest added Nicola was happy with her job and had a meeting with an important client before she went missing. ""Her mind was great, we picked the children up the Thursday before she went missing, as we do every Thursday.  ""We took them home, Nicola had had a meeting with her boss in Garstang and she said can you stay a bit later because I have an important client coming in on Zoom. ""We said no problem and stayed. She had done her work and she was very upbeat about getting her mortgage sorted. ""I said we better go now and Nicola came to the front door, and I gave her a kiss and told her I loved her and that was the last conversation I had with her.""

"EasyJet lets blind boy, 15, achieve dream of making boarding announcement at airport","Joshua Clark got the chance to speak to passenger over the Tannoy at the Liverpool John Lennon Airport easyJet gate, fulfilling a long held dream for the St Vincent's SchoolA young boy's dream of working as an airport announcer is that much closer to become a reality after he took to the Tannoys for the first time. Joshua Clark, 15, stood up to the intercom at Liverpool John Lennon Airport this week and expertly called customers to the boarding gate. The teenage set about telling easyJet passengers when and where to go, what priority boarding customers should do and extra details about their flight.  When Josh came to the end of his announcement he received a round of applause from the assembled staff and customers.  Do you have a travel story to share? Email webnew@reachplc.com   The experience could prove vital for the boy, who hopes to one day earn his crust making airport announcements full time. Conor McSorley, one of Josh's teachers at St Vincent's School in West Derby, told the Mirror what the experience meant to his pupils who visited the airport. ""It was a fantastic experience that Josh and the other pupils will never forget,"" he said.  ""I can’t say enough good things about Liverpool John Lennon Airport staff and the VIP treatment that gave us throughout, truly amazing. ""The smile on his face when he finished the boarding call and the passengers all clapped is something that will stay with me too.  ""Proper proud teacher moment for me."" The visit was not the first time that Josh has turned his hand at announcing.  Last year he was on a school trip in Liverpool city centre with his classmates when they paid a visit to the train station.    Mr McSorley said: ""I went down to Lime Street last week [and said] one of my pupils told me he dreamt of being a train announcer, would there be any possibility of him doing it? ""To the credit of the staff in Lime Street station they couldn't be more helpful."" Mr McSorley said a staff member at Lime Street called Caroline, who is believed to work for Northern Assist, was happy to help and told him to bring Josh down to the station on Tuesday. A heartwarming video shows the moment Josh read out the announcement for a train due to depart to Crewe after Caroline showed him what to do.  The video has been viewed more than 75,000 times since Mr McSorley shared it on Twitter with the caption: ""Josh has always dreamed of announcing trains and thanks to the kind people at Lime Street Station his dream became a reality today!""

'Inescapable' mega-prison built to tackle gang members that 'run 80 per cent' of country,"El Salvador has built a new mega-prison designed to house around 40,000 inmates. The new jail comes with 850 guards, steel walls and 19 watchtowers as the country tries to tackle its gang problemA mega-prison designed to house over 40,0000 inmates and described as ""inescapable"" has been built to tackle one country's gang problem.  El-Salvador has erected the huge 'Terrorism Containment Centre' so that inmates cannot have access to ""prostitutes, PlayStations, screens, mobile phones and computers,"" according to President Nayib Bukele. Deputy Justice Minister Osiris Luna said inmates would be made to work and this would ""compensate for some of the damage they did to society.""  He continued: ""All the terrorists who (caused) grief and pain to the Salvadoran people will serve their sentences... under the most severe regime.""  Around 850 prison staff, 600 of them soldiers, are needed to guard the facility in the remote area of Tecoluca. Guards will be given assault rivals to try and deter inmates from escaping.    In addition, there are 19 watchtowers, electric fencing, patrol zones and reinforced steel making up a perimeter wall.  At 166 hectares, the new facility could be the largest prison in the world. Currently, the Guinness World Records lists Silivri Penitentiaries Campus in Istanbul as the biggest.  Tecoluca reportedly has a population of around 30,000 people, meaning the number of people in the jail could outscore the population outside when at full capacity.   Around two per cent of El Salvador's population of 6.3 million are behind bars and overcrowding in the country's prisons has been slammed.  Approximately 20 prisons had a total capacity of 30,000 inmates but hold far more than intended. La Esperanza is El Salvador's largest prison and holds around 33,000 people despite having a capacity of just 10,000.  A national state of emergency was declared last year - this was extended by 30 days this month - amid an ongoing ""war"" against gangs in El Salvador.   The emergency declared intends to ""[to continue] the reestablishment of order, citizen security and territorial control"" and Bukele says gangs control around 80 per cent of the country.  The declaration gives the state emergency powers, which has been condemned by rights activists and the United Nations.  Over 62,000 are believed to have been detained under the powers. Human Rights Watch said: ""Many arrests appear to have been based on the appearance or social background of the detainees, and local human rights groups have documented that hundreds of people with no connection to gangs have been detained.""   They continued: ""Over 54,000 people arrested during the state of emergency went into pre-trial detention, contributing to prison populations increasing to an estimated 97,000 detainees, over three times official capacity ""Historically poor conditions in detention - overcrowding, violence, and poor access to such services as food and drinking water - worsened.""  'MS-13' and 'Barrio 18' are two of El Salvador's biggest gangs and have an estimated 70,000 people between them.

Brits warned never to share 'missing child' Facebook posts after 'autistic boy' hoax,"Police have warned Brits not to be conned by 'missing child' posts on Facebook that could see well-intentioned people tricked into sharing malicious and harmful links Police have warned Brits not to share ‘missing child’ posts on Facebook as you could be accidentally sharing a scam. There has been an increase in the hoax posts which claim to be trying to help find a missing kid - similar posts are often shared for missing pets or injured animals. But the cruel scam is actually a trick to con well-meaning Brits so instead of helping reunite a desperate family you could end up helping a crook profit. After getting people to share the post widely, they can edit it, including adding dubious links that friends, or others who trust you, might click as it looks like you’ve endorsed whatever is shared.   Fact checker site Full Fact uncovered one such bogus post that claimed an autistic boy called Brayden had gone missing along with the family dog. The post read: ""HELP!!! #Hartlepool My son Brayden JOHNSON took off this morning with our dog hank. ""He autistic and has been missing for eight hours if anyone sees him please PM me please re-post on any sites. ""I already contacted police.""  But Brayden, and his dog, don’t exist, the site confirmed, and no police forces have received missing persons reports.  Cleveland Police told them: “We do not have any missing person of that name. Any missing people appeals would go on official Cleveland Police social media pages (albeit some members of the public put their own on before police do it!)”  The post had already appeared in a number of local Facebook groups across the UK - all of which used the same photograph. Almost identical posts popped up in Kettering, Northamptonshire, and Newmarket, Suffolk.  Northamptonshire Police and Suffolk Constabulary both confirmed to Full Fact that none of the names matched people reported missing their areas.  Derbyshire Police Online Safety page warns: ""We've raised this subject previously, but further similar posts are still being widely shared on community pages. ""Please be aware of hoax posts regarding missing persons, missing pets, injured animals etc. ""Once shared a number of times, the post is edited to something else, such as crypto investments or fake scam giveaways. They say one way to tell if it's false is to see if the comments are disabled. This is a tactic used by criminals so they can't raise the alarm to others that it's fake. ""If the comments are disabled, DO NOT SHARE. ""Think! If you were trying to locate a vulnerable child, would you really disable comments?""

Man with 102 children says he can't afford any more as his 12 wives go on birth control,"Musa Hasahya Kasera admits to not knowing all of his children's names - and has even less recall when it comes to remembering the names of his staggering 578 grandchildrenA man who has fathered 102 children say's he's finally had enough and he cannot afford to have any more. Musa Hasahya Kasera admits to not knowing all of his children's names - and has even less recall when it comes to remembering the names of his staggering 578 grandchildren. The Ugandan father has had his huge brood with 12 wives, whose names he also admits to forgetting. However with such an enormous family Musa, 68, has finally said 'enough is enough' as he calls time on his reproductive journey - with children now ranging in age from 10 to 50, while his youngest wife is about 35. His wives are now also said to be taking birth control to stop the family growing further. Speaking from his village of Bugisa in the Butaleja district of Uganda, he said: ""At first it was a joke, but now this has it's problems"".   ""With my health failing and merely two acres of land for such a huge family, two of my wives left because I could not afford the basics like food, education, clothing."" Musa has now also become a small tourist attraction, with people travelling to meet him and members of his enormous family. Many of the family now live largely in a dilapidating house made from corrugated iron - while many others live in about two dozen grass-thatched mud huts nearby. Musa married his first wife in 1972 at a traditional ceremony when they were both 17 and his first child Sandra Nabwire was born a year later.  He added: ""Because we were born only two of us, I was advised by my brother, relatives and friends to marry many wives to produce many children to expand our family heritage."" Musa also said he became popular with families looking to marry their daughters off due to his status as a successful cattle traders. He said he regularly had families offering him their daughters' hand in marriage - some even below the age of 18.   Child marriage was only banned in Uganda in 1995, while polygamy is allowed in the East African country - according to certain religious traditions. Musa says he now has to consult one of his sons, Shaban Magino, a 30-year-old primary school teacher who helps run the family's affairs and is one of the few to have received an education. To keep as much harmony amongst the children as possible and settle disputes, Musa says they have monthly family meetings.

Kate Middleton teams up with Roman Kemp for short film discussing mental health,"The Princess of Wales and the radio presenter will discuss mental wellbeing and relationships in a short film that was recorded last month for the Shaping Us campaignKate Middleton has been pictured with radio presenter Roman Kemp during the filming of a video to promote her new early years campaign.  The Princess of Wales could be seen wrapping up warm against the winter chill as she sported a sheepskin coat, polo neck jumper and gloves. Kate smiles for the photographer with Kemp beaming beside her in the image of the pair taken in Hertfordshire last month. The princess launched her Shaping Us initiative on Tuesday, an ambitious campaign described as her “life’s work” and aimed at highlighting the importance of the early years development of children.   In the short film, due to be released on Friday, Kate and the Capital FM breakfast host will discuss the importance of mental wellbeing, relationships and how by nurturing children in the earliest years of their life, society can build a nation of healthy happy adults. Kemp, the son of Spandau Ballet star Martin Kemp, has previously spoken candidly about his mental health struggles after the death of close friend and Capital FM producer Joe Lyons.  In 2021, he presented a BBC Three documentary looking at the mental health crisis affecting young men and revealed he had considered taking his own life after battling depression for more than a decade.   Kate outlined the scope of her campaign, promoted this week by a series of events and videos, during a reception on Monday, describing it as a long-term project beginning with how a child develops and the importance of the formative years up to the age of five. She said it will go on to “explore in more depth the importance of a child’s social and emotional world” and the significance of relationships and “surroundings and experiences”. “And of course, by understanding our own childhoods – what has shaped our own beliefs, relationships, behaviours and feelings – we, as adults, are better placed to play our part in positively shaping future generations,” the princess added.

Energy suppliers urged to stop 'outrageous' force-fitting of prepayment meters in homes,"Grant Shapps has urged companies to suspend fitting the meters following reports that British Gas had been sending debt collectors to ""break into"" customers' homesEnergy suppliers are being urged to stop the 'outrageous' practice of force fitting prepayment meters in UK homes. Grant Shapps has urged companies to suspend fitting the meters following reports that British Gas had been sending debt collectors to ""break into"" customers' homes. The Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Secretary issued the plea on Thursday evening, shortly after a meeting between his department and the chief executive of Centrica, which owns British Gas, had taken place. The energy giant said it would stop applying for court warrants to enter customers' homes and fit the meters following reports they had been forced on ""vulnerable"" people. EDF said it had also suspended the practice while it reviewed its processes, and Mr Shapps has urged other suppliers to do the same. He said: ""EDF have now confirmed they have suspended the outrageous practice of forced installation of prepayment meters following the investigation into British Gas. ""I am now calling on all the other energy companies to confirm they are following suit.""   Energy companies can obtain court warrants which give them legal rights to enter people's homes and fit prepayment meters if customers have not paid their bills. Customers must then top up to continue receiving gas supplies and, if they fail to do so, they risk their heating being cut off. BEIS has said that ""forcibly switching customers should only ever be a last resort"" and it would be ""demanding answers to ensure this systemic failure is addressed"". The department said energy minister Graham Stuart met Chris O'Shea, the chief executive of Centrica, on Thursday afternoon, while Ofgem has launched an investigation into British Gas. Mr Stuart said he has asked Centrica to outline in writing how it will ensure the reported incidents will never happen again, and what role Mr O'Shea will take in fixing ""very serious cultural issues"" and in ""regaining the public's trust"". Mr Stuart said: ""I was horrified to read of the mistreatment of British Gas customers - this afternoon I have made it abundantly clear to Chris O'Shea, the chief executive, that this behaviour is completely unacceptable.""  ""I have asked Mr O'Shea to report back to me urgently outlining the role he will take personally to fix these very serious cultural issues,"" he added. ""I told him I want to see these vulnerable, mistreated customers identified and redress provided."" The Times reported that British Gas sends debt collectors to ""break into"" people's homes and ""force-fit"" pay-as-you-go meters - even when customers are known to have ""extreme vulnerabilities"". An undercover reporter for the newspaper worked for debt collecting contractor Arvato Financial Solutions and accompanied agents who used court warrants to gain entry into customers' homes to force-fit these meters. Some of the ""vulnerable"" customers the Times reporter came across while working at Arvato Financial Solutions included a single father with three young children and a mother with a four-week-old baby. Ahead of his meeting with Ms Taplin, Mr Stuart told the BBC: ""It's just appalling, it's not good enough. Only last week  British Gas announced steps they were going to take to support vulnerable customers and it turns out they were doing anything but. ""There are clear rules and they've obviously not been followed and, therefore, I need the regulator and the companies to do the right thing by people who are in the most difficult of circumstances and have been treated on this evidence appallingly."" An Ofgem spokesman said: ""These are extremely serious allegations from The Times which we will investigate urgently with British Gas and we won't hesitate to take firm enforcement action. ""It is unacceptable for any supplier to impose forced installations on vulnerable customers struggling to pay their bills before all other options have been exhausted and without carrying out thorough checks to ensure it is safe and practicable to do so. ""We recently announced a major market-wide review investigating the rapid growth in prepayment meter installations and potential breaches of licences driving it. ""We are clear that suppliers must work hard to look after their customers at this time, especially those who are vulnerable, and the energy crisis must not be an excuse for unacceptable behaviour towards any customer - particularly those in vulnerable circumstances."" An EDF spokesperson said: ""In 2022, we applied for 13,766 warrants in relation to domestic customer debt and in around half of these cases we took the decision not to proceed once the customer had engaged and we understood their circumstances. ""We regularly review and update these processes and so we are confident they are fit for purpose. Nonetheless we are currently reviewing them again to reconfirm they are robust and see if we can make any improvements. ""We have suspended forced installation of prepayment meters while we conduct this latest review."" Simon Francis, co-ordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said: ""Ministers have fallen for the energy industry's spin that they don't use court warrants to install prepayment meters on vulnerable customers.  ""The investigation reveals this not to be the case. ""It is time that the Government stood up to energy firms and banned the forced installation of prepayment meters and the forced switching of smart meters to prepayment mode. ""We also now need a formal inquiry into the prepayment meters scandal and the role of the courts in enabling this practice."" Owner of British Gas, Centrica, announced it was suspending ""all warrant activity"" after the newspaper's article was published. The parent company will also launch an investigation into the claims. Mr O'Shea said: ""Protecting vulnerable customers is an absolute priority and we have clear processes and policies to ensure we manage customer debt carefully and safely. ""The allegations around our third-party contractor Arvato are unacceptable and we immediately suspended their warrant activity. ""Having recently reviewed our internal processes to support our prepayment customers as well as creating a new £10 million fund to support those prepayment customers who need help the most, I am extremely disappointed that this has occurred. ""As a result, on Wednesday morning, we took a further decision to suspend all our prepayment warrant activity at least until the end of the winter. ""More broadly, there are clearly significant challenges around affordability and, unfortunately, we don't see that changing any time soon. ""We need to strike a balance between managing spiralling bad debt and being aware that there are those who refuse to pay and those who cannot pay.  ""We think government, industry and the regulator need to come together to agree a long-term plan to address this and ultimately create an energy market that is sustainable."" Arvato Financial Solutions has been contacted for comment, as has Energy UK, which represents suppliers. Hundreds of thousands of customers have been switched over to more costly prepayment meters, often unwillingly and without the offer of support, after failing to keep up with rising energy payments. Some have found their smart meters switched to prepayment mode remotely while others have been confronted at their door by teams sent by energy companies - armed with magistrates' court warrants - to physically make the change. Just last week, Ofgem said it is to review the checks and balances that energy firms have around placing customers on prepayment meters, warning it will take further legal action if it finds they are not taking due care. In a blog, the watchdog's chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said he is concerned about the ""sharp growth in households struggling to pay their bills being switched over to prepayment meters, sometimes without their even knowing about it, leaving them without heating"". Mr Brearley wrote: ""The numbers of forced installation of prepayment meters is extremely high. It is simply not acceptable that vulnerable customers are left in the dark and cold in winter. ""This review will focus specifically on self-disconnections, remote switching and forced installations, and the checks and balances companies have around any decision to put a customer on a prepayment meter. ""If we find that they have not taken due care in this process, we will take further legal action against them."" Campaigners say those switched often then go without power as they cannot afford to keep the meter topped up - something that is referred to as ""self-disconnection"". It comes after energy bills have soared due to rampant inflation and the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Activists gather to support ­'Barclays 7' women who broke windows at bank’s headquarters,"Climate activists want to draw attention to Barclays’ role as the UK and Europe’s largest fossil fuel investor – and their tactics were inspired by the suffragettes’ window smashing protests of 1911 and 1912Outside Southwark Crown Court in London, climate activists are gathering to support the ­“Barclays 7” – a group of women who broke windows at the bank’s headquarters. The women say they took the action to draw attention to Barclays’ role as the UK and Europe’s largest fossil fuel investor – and they have drawn their tactics from the suffragettes’ window smashing protests of 1911 and 1912. As the crowd listens to speeches in support of the women, 78-year-old Jilly Yglesias shows me a picture on her phone of her great-aunt Gladys. “Gladys was one of the window smashers,” she says.  “She was a suffragette, and she smashed the window at Asprey’s on Bond Street. She was arrested and sent to Holloway Prison where she endured torture by the state – force-feeding that left her mentally and ­physically damaged.   “As her great-niece, I am here to give my support to the brave seven women who broke the windows at Barclays Bank. The bank is financing the destruction of our planet, and sometimes direct action is needed for people to listen.” Birmingham schoolteacher Gladys Mary Hazel joined the suffragettes around 1908, after hearing Emmeline Pankhurst speak. She began to take part in Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU) protests and was among 300 women violently attacked on November 18, 1910, a date known as “Black Friday”. On March 1, 1912, Gladys was among suffragettes who took part in a meticulously-planned action. Well-dressed ladies, apparently window-shopping in the West End, brought out toffee hammers and rocks at an agreed time and began smashing windows at 15-minute intervals. Some stones and hammers carried slogans. Dressmaker Lillian Ball’s hammer had the words: “Better broken windows than broken promises” inscribed on it. During the Barclays 7 action, which took place at 7am on April 7, 2021, the women wore a patch bearing the same slogan. They placed stickers on the windows of the bank in Canary Wharf reading: “In case of climate emergency break glass”, before carefully hitting the glass with hammers and chisels.  “I smashed Asprey’s windows in New Bond Street and I never enjoyed anything so much in my life,” Gladys wrote in an unpublished memoir her family discovered after her death in 1959, at the age of 79. “As [the policeman] had to run in the same direction as me, we went ­skidding along the pavement and I managed to break two more windows while he actually had hold of me.” She added: “I heard the pride in my voice as I told the tea party how the judge in court had looked from the large man in the witness box to me and said: ‘You say she broke two more windows after you had hold of her?’” Some 126 women were committed for trial. Reported in the Daily Mirror under the headline “Women Terrorists of London”, a reporter described “Amazonian hammerwomen” taking to the streets. Records from The National Archives show Gladys was arrested at Bow Street on March 5, 1912, and on multiple other occasions from 1909-1912. The Votes for Women newspaper records her being sentenced to six months in Holloway. She took part in a hunger strike there and endured the horrors of ­force-feeding.  “A tube [was] jammed in my nose, and the doctor, thinking probably that I was stopping it, went on pushing till in the end he had to pull it out with a wrench,” she wrote. “We were in a new wing of iron and concrete, where every sound carried and rang, and they took about three hours over the women before me, as I was last of all. That was nerve-wracking, and I had not been prepared for the sense of outrage and violation I felt.” A new book based on her memoir, The Courage Game by Jeni Whittaker, Jilly’s second cousin, tells how later during her prison term, Gladys witnessed Emily Wilding Davison, who died after being hit by King George V’s horse at the 1913 derby, throwing herself down a staircase. Gladys also contemplated taking her own life. Jilly says Great Aunt Gladys would have approved of the actions of ­Rosemary Annie Webster, Cazzie Wood, Gabby Ditton, Lucy Porter, Sophie Cowen, Zoe Cohen, and one other (who cannot be named for legal reasons) who were found guilty of causing criminal damage to Barclays Bank but spared jail, and given suspendedsentences. Also at Southwark Crown Court was actor and activist Juliet Stevenson, and Helen Pankhurst, great-granddaughter of Emmeline – who had inspired Gladys to join the suffragettes.  “I come with my Pankhurst surname… to make the link to the suffragettes,” Helen, also the ­granddaughter of Sylvia Pankhurst, told the gathering crowd. “To make the link with women who over 100 years ago fought against the status quo, fought against the intransigence of those who wanted to continue business as usual… “They used direct action because constitutional methods were getting them nowhere and they felt they had to use disruptive tactics to make a change.” She turned to the Barclays 7. “Carol, Gabriella, Lucy, Rosemary, Sophie, Zoe – granddaughters and great-granddaughters of the spirit of the suffragettes. Sisters, I salute you.” “The argument of the broken pane of glass,” Emmeline Pankhurst once told WSPU members, “is the most valuable argument in modern politics.” A century later, that argument is being repeated.

Up to 20 hours of Tyre Nichols footage set to reveal what cops said after fatal beating,"Up to 20 hours of additional footage could be released - including audio of what the Memphis officers charged with murder said immediately after Mr Nichols was taken to hospital.Audio recorded after the death of Tyre Nichols is set to reveal what the police officers charged with his murder said after the horror beating of the 29-year-old dad. A video of the brutal three-minute assault of the handcuffed and unarmed Mr Nichols shocked the world and led to widespread protests in multiple cities across America.  It shows officers savagely beating him for three minutes, during which the victim is pepper-sprayed, hit with a stun gun, restrained and kicked.  Now up to 20 hours of additional footage could be released - including audio of what the Memphis officers charged with murder said immediately after Mr Nichols was taken to hospital.   The City of Memphis and Memphis police are set to make a decision on when the footage and audio will be released, reports CNN. The young father had been pulled over as he was on his way home from taking pictures of the sunset. The officers involved have all been fired and each face charges of second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression. In the footage, in which he is not seen resisting, Mr Nichols can be heard repeatedly calling for his mum and pleading ""I'm just trying to go home"".  Yesterday, hundreds gathered for Mr Nichols' funeral - including those who have also lost loved ones at the hands of police brutality.  Vice President Kamala Harris was also among the congregation at the Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church. Kamala Harris spoke at the service after the Rev. Al Sharpton invited her to the pulpit. She condemned police violence that led to Tyre's death. She said: ""This violent act was not in pursuit of public safety. Was he not also entitled to the right to be safe?  ""Tyre Nichols should've been safe."" Harris also demanded Congress pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, adding: ""We should not delay and we will not be denied, it is nonnegotiable."" At the beginning of her address, she told Mr Nichols' parents: ""You have been extraordinary in terms of your strength, your courage and your grace, and we mourn with you and the people of our country mourn with you.  ""Mothers around the world, when their babies are born, pray to God, when they hold that child, that that body and that life will be safe for the rest of his life. ""Yet, we have a mother and a father who mourn the life of a young man who should be here today. They have a grandson who now does not have a father."" The service opened with a montage of images of Tyre as child, through to adulthood - as well as some images he had taken through his passion for amateur photography.  The Rev. Al Sharpton thanked the families of other Black people killed at the hands of police, including George Floyd’s family, for joining the service for Tyre Nichols. Sharpton asked the families to stand as they received applause from the crowd. Sharpton said the families of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner, Botham Jean and others were present.

"Firefighters offered £1,000 a shift to cross picket line during upcoming strikes","Fire chiefs are offering service members £1,000 a shift to cross the picket lines during upcoming strikes for 'resilience fire cover' in a move the union slammed as an 'insult'Fire chiefs are offering staff £1,000 a shift to cross picket lines during expected strikes. Crews nationwide have voted to walk out as soon as next month unless they get a revised pay offer.  Hertfordshire Fire Service re­­­sponded with an offer of bumper pay for those ignoring the strike.  It wrote to staff offering £1,000 for “resilience fire cover”. The cash will be paid for cover­­ing a single 24-hour shift even if only an hour is worked. The offer is open to roles inclu­­ding firefighters, crew comman­­ders, station commanders and fire control operators. The Fire Brigades Union called it “an insult” and “a terrible waste of public money”.   General Secretary Matt Wrack said: “If the money can be found to pay people these kinds of sums to break strikes, it can be found for a decent pay deal. “What is being reported about Hertfordshire is likely to be the tip of the iceberg. “All over the country, fire and rescue services will be putting in place contingency arrangements – very often at great expense. “This is an insult to firefighters who are struggling after more than a decade of falling pay. “It also represents a terrible use of public money. “We registered a pay claim in May 2022 and have been trying to negotiate a settlement ever since.  “The average firefighter has lost the real terms equivalent of about £4,000 a year in pay since 2010. We want to resolve this dispute without striking and it’s up to the employ­­ers to come for­­ward with a decent pay offer.”   Hertfordshire Fire Service said: “We hope this dis­­pute can be re­­­solved and that a nationwide strike can be avoided. “However, like all fire services, we need contingency plans to meet our statutory obligations.  “While we sup­­port firefight­­ers’ right to strike and understand their con­­­cerns, we have a duty to keep people safe and need to ensure that if some­­one calls 999 with a life-threatening emergency during a strike that someone will come and help them. We have therefore been looking at ways to secure enough cover from fully qualified firefighters.   “This resilience plan has included in it an option of additional payments to firefighters who are willing to respond during strikes.” More than 80% of Fire Brigades Union members balloted last month voted to strike. The union says that since 2010 crews have experienced a 12% drop in real terms earnings. It also says that in the same period about one in five jobs have been cut. If the strike goes ahead it will be the first nationwide walkout over pay in 20 years. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/firefighters-offered-1000-shift-cross-29119637
"Around 900,000 households will get £400 energy bill help this month - see who'll get it","The UK Government announced that the Energy Bills Support Scheme Alternative Funding application portal is expected to be up and running by Monday, February 27, 2023Around 900,000 households will be able to access the £400 energy bill help at the end of February rather than at the end of January as originally planned.  The UK Government has announced that the Energy Bills Support Scheme Alternative Funding application portal is expected to be up and running by Monday, February 27, 2023. Once the online hub and telephone helpline opens, households without a direct relationship with a domestic electricity supplier can apply for their £400 energy payment.  This includes people who live in park homes, houseboats, off-grid and care homes, or those paying their energy bills as part of an all-inclusive rental agreement with their landlord.   Energy Minister Graham Stuart told MPs about the revised opening date in the House of Commons last week.  The Energy Minister blamed the delay on the ""complicated"" nature of the application process.  He told MPs: “The EBSS alternative funding sounds simple, but it is not. It is a novel scheme with ambitious timescales. It is a complex cohort with a range of different energy arrangements, including off-grid, direct to commercial and via intermediaries."" Mr Stuart said the Government must ""make sure"" it sorts out all complexities first because, if it ""does not get it right first time"" it would cause a delay in payments to consumers. The energy minister also explained that ""robust fraud checks are necessary for an application-based system, to which there is no alternative for this group"" and every step of the process must be tested. He added: “My priority is to get funding to people as quickly as possible.”  The Government announced the alternative finding scheme last year as those who do not have a direct relationship with their supplier have had to face significant rises to their bills with little support.  The group includes:  care home residents  residents of park homes  tenants in certain private and social rented homes  homes supplied via private wires  residents of caravans and houseboats on registered sites  farmers living in domestic farmhouses  off-grid households  To get this support, these households will need to submit an online form through the Government's website when it opens at the end of this month.  Once the application is submitted and has been processed and verified, eligible applications will be shared with local councils across England, Scotland and Wales, who will deliver the one-off, non-repayable £400 payment.  The exact you will then receive the cash depends on when you submit your application and when you local authority can process the payment.  The payment will likely be made at some point in March, but no confirmation of this has yet been made by the Government. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/around-900000-households-400-energy-29122220
'British Gas forced me onto a prepayment meter while I was at a hospital appointment',"Jaki spoke to Mirror Money today after an investigation by the Times revealed that British Gas ""routinely"" sends debt collectors to break into customers’ homes and force-fit pay-as-you-go meters, even when they are known to be vulnerableA mum-of-four has recalled how she returned how from a hospital appointment to find British Gas had installed a prepayment gas meter in her home - despite her being a vulnerable customer. Jaki Whyte, 41, from Colchester, arrived home in November 2021 to find the meter door ""ripped off"" and a note posted through her letter box telling her to call British Gas. She spoke to Mirror Money today after an investigation by the Times revealed that British Gas ""routinely"" sends debt collectors to break into customers’ homes and force-fit pay-as-you-go meters, even when they are known to have extreme vulnerabilities. She said: ""I was in absolute hysterics, I didn't even know how to top up a prepayment meter.  ""I had to go to my best friend's house to help calm me down and to call them because I didn't have credit. I just didn't know what was going on.""  Jaki has 11 diagnosed disabilities and mental health conditions, which include Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, fibromyalgia, autism, and arthritis, and has been on the Priority Services Register for over ten years.   She was always classed as a ""low energy user"" and had never been in debt before paying her energy bill by standing order.  Previously she was able to cover her monthly costs with her Personal Independence Payment (PIP) money and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA).  However, Jaki had her ESA payment stopped several years ago after she was unable to attend her ""fit to work"" assessment because her local test centre was not wheelchair accessible. After her ESA was stopped, she struggled to stretch her £600 PIP payment to cover her monthly costs.  She said: ""I had to prioritise my health above anything else, so my PIP money was used for taxis to get me to the hospital and I needed to save up to buy my NHS Prescription Prepayment Certificate so I could get my medicine. ""Something had to give and it was paying my gas because a just didn't have the money.""   Jaki started to receive letters from her energy provider telling her about the debt which was building up.  However, she admitted she often missed these letters and would struggle to read them due to her mental health disabilities. Jaki told the Mirror she had explained her situation to British Gas and asked them to contact her over the phone for everything regarding her account - but said this did not happen.  She said she ""tried her best"" to contact the energy firm to sort out a payment scheme to clear the debt but was often left on hold for so long that she ran out of credit on her pay-as-you-go phone.  When she did get through, she claimed British Gas asked for payments four times higher than she could afford.  She said: ""There just seemed to be no acknowledgement or consideration of my situation and they wouldn't budge, there was literally no debate about it at all even though I was on the Priority Service.  ""I said I could do an extra £5 a month to help clear it, which would lose me a day of food but they wanted £20 and I couldn't do it, I didn't have the money.""  This winter was Jaki's second with the gas prepayment meter and she says she only ""managed to survive"" because of the electric blanket her best friend had got her.  She said: ""It's been awful, for half of the month I have had to wash my hands in cold water, have cold showers and my carer has had to boil the kettle to do the washing up, genuinely the only thing that has kept me alive is my electric blanket.""  Jaki said this winter has been ""even harder"" than the last due to rising costs but also because she also did not receive the £650 Cost of Living payment as claimants of PIP were not included. She also lost her £150 Warm Homes Discount payment this year, but did receive the one-off £150 Disability Cost of Living Payment. Jaki faced having her electricity meter changed into prepay six weeks ago however she was able to argue against the installation happening saying that it would be the difference between ""life and death"".  She described British Gas' prepay installation practice as ""callous"" and said its pause on forced installations should be made a permanent measure. Jaki said: ""I understand the theory behind prepayment meters but in practice, it just does not work, the fact you can have 90% of your payment taken to cover debt is absolutely disgusting and should not be allowed, it just causes more debt."" A British Gas spokesperson told the Mirror: ""We’ve been contacting Mrs Whyte since 2018 to help her manage her energy bills.  ""We appreciate her difficult situation and we’ll be in contact with her to see what kind of assistance we can put in place.""

"Boy, 10, killed and friend, 9, seriously injured after being hit and dragged by train","According to a police spokesman, both boys are from the town of Recklinghausen and they also confirmed several other young people were involved in the accident but did not give further details.A double tragedy struck Germany after two young boys were hit and dragged by a train, killing one and injuring the other. The youngsters, ages 9 and 10, were dragged by a freight train for several hundred metres in the western German town of Recklinghausen, in the Ruhr industrial region, on Thursday evening. The incident happened around 6:12 pm and the unnamed 10-year-old boy died. Local media said another nine-year-old suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital, but he is no longer in acute danger. According to a police spokesman, both boys are from the town of Recklinghausen and they also confirmed several other young people were involved in the accident but did not give further details.   Details over the incident are scant, however, local media said around of 35 firemen and rescue workers were deployed to the accident site, near a former freight yard. Herbert Reul, interior minister of the North Rhine-Westphalia, told the press: ""It's horrible. Children and trains and at such a young age, it's just horrible what happened here and one can only hope the parents will have the strength to overcome this great misfortune. ""Why, how come, these are all questions that no one can yet answer and wouldn't solve anything."" In June, five people were killed and 44 others injured after a train derailed in southern Germany. Emergency workers found bodies under the rubble of the train as cranes hoisted at least one carriage which had rolled off the tracks.  The regional train was northbound to Munich when the accident happened, derailing near Garmisch-Partenkirchen close to the Loisachauen industrial park. Several carriages overturned and some fell down the embankment. According to Tagblatt, there were numerous students aboard when the train derailed near the popular ski resort town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The horror crash comes only days after Germany launched a new discounted rail ticket to encourage its citizens to take the train and it was said the train was ""very crowded and many people were using it, hence the high number of injured"".

Raging driver rams POLICE OFFICER off motorbike and speeds off in horror hit and run,"Joseph Ward reversed into Inspector Tony McGovern in a horrific smash that left the officer needing to be rushed to hospital before a manhunt finally brought him to justiceA raging driver rammed a police officer off his motorbike before speeding off in a horror hit and run. Joseph Ward, 24, slammed into Inspector Tony McGovern in a desperate effort to avoid being arrested for more than a dozen offences including impersonating a police officer. The disqualified driver reversed into the motorcycle cop and left him seriously injured on the road before driving off. Insp McGovern had been on a motorcycle patrol in Haringey, North London, on July 1, last year, when he spotted Ward behaving suspiciously in a grey Mitsubishi 4x4. The officer pulled Ward over and spoke with him through his driver side window after the car stopped.   Insp McGovern can be heard asking Ward to turn the engine off when the driver speeds forward before coming to a stop. He then reverses back into the police officer, ramming him with considerable force before speeding away again.  Insp McGovern was left with injuries to his legs, shoulders and back, and called for urgent help from colleagues before he was rushed to hospital.  As the hunt for Ward began, officers discovered he was already wanted for demanding money from another driver in the same area around a week before the incident. Following a manhunt, Ward was arrested in Hertfordshire on July 20, and was charged with causing grievous bodily harm to Insp McGovern and driving disqualified, then linked to two other offences relating to a car crash on 5 July. Then, the very next day he had failed to stop for police in Enfield, North London, and damaged two police cars.  Ward, of Royston, Herts, admitted 14 offences, including assault occasioning actual bodily harm, impersonating a police officer, dangerous driving and failing to stop for police. He was jailed for a total of four years at Wood Green Crown Court. Insp McGovern said: “I have been a police officer for 18 years and I never expected to be deliberately rammed off my motorbike in such a violent and aggressive act.  “I continue to recover from the injuries I suffered that day, however I remain determined to serve the people of London and remove violent and dangerous offenders from the streets."" Detective Chief Superintendent Lee Hill, who leads the Violent Crime Taskforce that McGovern was apart of, said: “Joseph Ward is a dangerous man and I have no doubt that he would have gone on to commit more offences. “I am pleased that he has received a custodial sentence and I praise Tony for his outstanding bravery.  “Our officers work tirelessly to protect the public from violent crime and we will never tolerate any form of assault on emergency workers, whose job it is to protect the public.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/raging-driver-rams-police-officer-29117417
"Boy, 5, saved by mum after terrifying mountain lion attack leaves him in hospital","Jack, 5, was walking near the family farm in Half Moon Bay, California, US, on January 31 when he was savagely attacked by a mountain lion as he suffered a fracture and cuts near his eyeA 5-year-old boy was saved by his mum after she fought off a terrifying mountain lion attack against her son.  The boy, who has been named only as Jack, was walking near the family farm in Half Moon Bay, California, US, on January 31 when he was savagely attacked. Jack was left with cuts to his face and a fracture near his eye, along with scratches and bruises, following the attack.  His mum, who has not been named, came to her son's rescue as she helped fend off the mountain lion.  Jack was rushed to hospital where he was treated for his trauma injuries.  His aunt, named as Amie Wagner, has started a GoFundMe to help with his medical bills and at the time of writing, it had notched up over $15,000 (£12,000) out of a $10,000 (£8,000) goal. Despite his injuries, his aunt said that Jack's ""spirit remains intact"".  She said: ""That mountain lion picked the wrong kid and mama to mess with.""   She wrote on the GoFundMe page: ""He is the most courageous, adventurous little guy I have ever met and I am not surprised that if there was a kid who could wrestle a mountain lion and come out on top, it would be Jack."" She also said: ""They are a hard-working, amazing family, dedicating their life's work to running a program for the area's homeless population on the farm, in addition to a program that serves underprivileged students."" San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office said they were ""dispatched to a report of a mountain lion attack and we can confirm a child was transported to a local trauma centre after the attack."" Emergency services were called to the scene to find the child conscious but quickly rushed Jack to hospital.  The sheriff's office said the whole community has been left in shock following the vicious attack. In a statement they said: ""Our coastal community has endured so much these past few weeks. “Our entire agency is saddened of this news and sends many warm wishes to the child for a speedy and full recovery.

Mum slams hospital after son left disabled at birth - 11 years later NHS admits fault,"Adam Cheshire was left profoundly disabled after his care at birth at the scandal hit Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust fell woefully short. Eleven years on the trust has admitted 80% responsibility The mum of a boy who was left profoundly disabled after his birth at the scandal hit Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust has spoken out after a judge finally confirmed his care will be paid for life.  Widowed Charlotte Cheshire has been fighting for Adam, who is now 11-years-old, since he was born at Shrewsbury Hospital.  In the hours after her son's birth his health deteriorated. He showed signs of early-onset Group B Strep infection - a bacterial infection that can lead to meningitis. Maternity staff classed Adam's condition as 'normal' despite him not feeding adequately since birth. He wasn't diagnosed with GBS and meningitis until the following day, and spent almost a month in neonatal intensive care. His case was one of many that were part of the Ockenden report published in March 2022. Today, Adam has brain damage, hearing and visual impairments, autism, severe learning difficulties, and behavioural problems. He will likely rely on others to care for him for the rest of his life, and will be unable to work or live independently.    His mum, and late father Chris who died from cancer in 2020, had been fighting to secure funding for Adam's care which will be lifelong.  Last Monday at the High Court the liability settlement was agreed by Mrs Justice Thornton and an interim payment was agreed. Speaking to the Mirror, Charlotte who is a Church of England priest, said: ""It's been a long time coming.  ""I have been fighting for years and I now know that Adam is going to be cared for, for the rest of his life.""  Charlotte, 44, from Newport, Shropshire says Adam can get frustrated and at 11 he is already 13 stone and 5ft 6in, so she knows going forward she is going to need help from specialists who can help care and control him.  She said: ""I love Adam with all my heart, but he still needs cleaning and looking after, I have a boy with the developmental age of a toddler who needs 24-hour care but is going to grow up like his father and will likely be 6ft 6."" Speaking of the moment in the High Court when the ruling was made, Charlotte said sitting in the old court building was intimidating, but she was relieved when the judge confirmed the settlement the trust, and the family's solicitors, had come to.  She said: ""After she made her ruling to say the trust accepts 80% of Adam's injuries, she paid tribute to me.  ""She said I was a dedicated mother and tireless campaigner, and she commented on how hard it must have been on my own after my husband's death.  ""My husband has been dead three years, I'm used to his absence, but at that moment he should have been there to see it.   ""He was very much the person who supported me and got on the floor to play with Adam, he should have been there."" Charlotte added: ""This isn't a lottery win, for me my personal finances don't change. This doesn't impact my personal quality of life or my day to day. But if Adam need care I can now get it for him."" Her solicitor, Irwin Mitchell’s specialist Court of Protection team, will now manage Adam's fund.  Charlotte is now calling on pregnant women to be routinely tested for Group B Strep on the NHS.  The UK does not routinely test pregnant women unlike most wealthy countries such as the USA, Canada and much of Europe. Yet if the test was carried out routinely as part of the maternity care women receive, it would cost the NHS just £11. One baby a week in the UK dies from Group B Strep usually within hours of being born, while 75 babies each year with the infection survive birth but are left with a disability - like Adam.  She added: ""At no point in my pregnancy or in the hours after Adam was born was I told about Group B Strep. ""I later found out following a review of my records, that early in my pregnancy it was decided that I wouldn’t have a test for GBS because I didn’t have the risk factors associated with it.  ""It was very hard to learn that this had been considered but not discussed with me considering the eventual outcome."" Sara Burns, the expert medical negligence lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, representing Charlotte said: ""While the maternity failings which were allowed to manifest at Shrewsbury and Telford over many years are well documented, their shocking nature never diminishes. ""Behind each case is a human tragedy of how families have been left devastated by medical errors. ""Many of these were avoidable and have led to the deaths of babies or incredibly serious birth injuries, which have caused severe disabilities and people and needing a lifetime of specialist care. ""We believe that Adam’s care was typical of many issues families have raised. Serial observations were missed, signs that should have been acted upon weren’t and serious illnesses were diagnosed too late. ""While nothing can ever make up for what happened to Adam, we’re pleased to have secured this liability settlement which has been approved by the High Court – which means Adam will receive the lifetime care and support he requires because of his complex needs.  ""Sadly, what happened at Shrewsbury and Telford doesn’t seem to be an isolated incident. We continue to receive many first-hand accounts from families across the UK affected by issues in maternity care. She adds: ""Although GBS can make babies very unwell, most will recover with prompt treatment. ""A simple test can be conducted to highlight whether an expectant mum is a carrier of group B Strep and her care plan can be adjusted to ensure intravenous antibiotics are provided throughout labour to prevent the infection being transmitted."" Charity Group B Strep Support's chief executive Jane Plumb added: ""It's devastating Adam did not get the care he needed at the time and that the severe disabilities he now lives with as a result of group B Strep meningitis could have and should have been prevented. ""The UK falls behind so many countries by not offering GBS testing to pregnant women and people and too often not even telling them about GBS.  ""This needs to change. Families deserve better.""

Aldi selling bags of food worth £10 - but it will only cost customers £3.30,"Aldi is tacking food waste surplus by offering shoppers 'Magic Bags' from £3.30 which include grocery products that are approaching their sell-by or use-by datesAldi has rolled out its Too Good To Go partnership across all of its 990 UK stores. The supermarket is now offering surplus food bags across its stores as a means of tackling food waste while also helping customers to save money, following a successful trial. The nationwide store is now offering ""Magic Bags"" which will include a range of grocery products that are approaching their sell-by or use-by dates. This comes following news that shop prices have hit new heights as the cost of living crisis continues - as experts warn that the peak inflation hasn't yet been reached.   Priced from just £3.30 each, these bags will contain at least £10 worth of food. In order to purchase the bags, shoppers will need to download the free Too Good To Go app on their phones, and then search for their nearby Aldi store. They will then be able to reserve a bag to collect from the store at an allotted time. Aldi says that they expect the move to save a a further 4,000 tonnes of food from going to waste annually. This new scheme will form a key part of its ongoing commitment to cut food waste, as Aldi says that it will also continue to donate surplus food to local causes every day of the year.   Aldi UK corporate responsibility director, Liz Fox said: “Rolling out our partnership with Too Good To Go is another way of allowing us to cut down on food waste, while also offering customers the opportunity to pick up our food at even lower prices. “With the rising cost of living impacting so many, Too Good To Go offers a simple and accessible way for consumers to save money and reduce waste.” And speaking about the scheme, Too Good To Go managing director Sophie Trueman said: “We’re thrilled to be rolling out our partnership.  “Having already had fantastic feedback during a successful trial period, I know our community is going to jump at the chance to save Magic Bags from their local Aldi and prevent even more good food from going to waste.” Since 2019, the German supermarket chain has donated more than 30 million meals via its successful partnership with Neighbourly. Other Too Good To Go partners include YoSushi, Costa, Morrisons, Pret and Greene King.  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/aldi-makes-huge-change-affecting-29104516

But the night took a terrifying turn when Mike was rushed to hospital following a dancefloor trick gone wrong. Kelsey explained how Mike has attempted a backflip before landing badly and suffering a brain injury which meant he had to relearn how to walk, talk and eat.  She told news.com.au: ""Mike attempted his party trick – which is a backflip on the dance floor that he typically lands,” Kelsey said in a now-viral TikTok video.   ""But he slipped on the floor because there were drinks spilt and he was wearing dress shoes that had no traction."" Kelsey described how chaos ensued the moment he landed on his head, reports the New York Post. He was then rushed to hospital in Denver, Colorado, where he underwent emergency surgery - called a craniectomy, which was to relieve the swelling on his brain.  Mike was then put in a coma for a month before then being placed in intensive care where he had to learn how to stand, walk and eat independently again. Kelsey said her husband is now ""progressing well"" and says his family are ""very proud of him"". A Go Fund Me page has also been set up to support the family cover Mike’s medical bills and help family from his home in Missouri to visit him as he recovers.

Rishi Sunak slammed for 'fly posting' as he leaves levelling up poster on old building,"Locals complained after gaffe-prone Rishi Sunak failed to take the 'ugly political slogan' off the town hall in Accrington. It was eventually removed two days laterGaffe-prone Rishi Sunak has been accused of “fly posting” after he slapped a levelling up poster on an historic building. The Prime Minister posed for photographs putting the slogan on the town hall in Accrington. But locals complained after it was left up for two days when he failed to take it down. The gaffe happened on the same day as his disastrous tour of the country on 19 January. During a visit to Blackpool that morning he was filmed not wearing a seatbelt in the back of a car and ended up with a fine from the police.    Kimberley Whitehead, a Labour councillor who made a complaint about the poster, accused the PM of “fly posting”.  “It's a beautiful building. It's an iconic building right in the centre and then we had this ugly political slogan effectively defacing the front of the building,” she said. Referring to Mr Sunak’s serial rule-breaking, including not wearing a seatbelt, she added: “People just rubbish these things off, but actually they are really serious. Rules are rules.”  The Government's levelling-up mess was met by a massive outcry, with Tories accused of overlooking bids from deprived areas in favour of wealthier places. The poster only added to Ms Whitehead’s frustration with the scheme. She said: “The way the whole levelling up funding is set up, the fact that would have to bid to kind of compete against other people, doesn't sit well with places like here that are desperate.  “We shouldn't be having to say to them that we need help. It's pretty obvious we need help. “Whilst we're grateful to receive some money, we've actually lost hundreds of millions in funding. So it's like, as the saying goes, they’ve taken £20 off us and they're given us £2 back.” She also said a huge proportion of the money was going towards refurbishing the market hall into a food and drinks hub which she said “isn’t levelling up”. “It impacts small businesses around. It's a controversial project that doesn't have the support of the people, or the public, the residents here.”  An investigation by Hyndburn council found there was no damage done to Accrington’s Market Hall by the PM and Chancellor Jeremy Hunt ’s photo stunt.  The PM’s seatbelt fine is the second fixed penalty notice he has received in less than a year.  He was fined by police in April for attending a lockdown-busting gathering  in No10 to celebrate Boris Johnson's 56th birthday when he was chancellor.

Royal Mail announces fresh strike as pay dispute threatens more deliveries chaos,"The Communication Workers Union have announced a fresh Royal Mail strike is set to go ahead on February 16 as the dispute over pay and working conditions rages onRoyal Mail workers are set to stage another strike as part of a long-running dispute over pay and conditions, the Communication Workers Union (CWU) have announced.  In the first postal strike of the year, workers will stage a 24-hour walkout on Thursday, February 16 starting at 12.30pm. The CWU said that for the ""vast majority of members"" this means that the strike day will be on Friday, February 17.  Over 115,000 members of the union will be taking part in the mass walkout.  The fresh strike action threatens more disruption to mail deliveries and marks the latest in a bitter dispute between the union and Royal Mail bosses.  CWU members took a total of 18 days of strike action during the second half of 2022, including two in the run up to Christmas.   The new walkout was announced despite talks last month at the conciliation service Acas aimed at breaking the deadlocked row. The union’s national elected leadership have called the strike because the Royal Mail began forcing through unagreed changes related to the structure of work at offices across the country, the CWU claims. They said that the changes were in ""direct contravention"" of the Industrial Relations (IR) Framework established between both parties and that it could be seen as a ""real step towards the derecognition of the union."" CWU General Secretary Dave Ward said: “This action is down to the conduct of Royal Mail management, who have displayed a complete lack of integrity. “Our members will not just sit back and watch as their working lives are destroyed by a company leadership hell-bent on ripping up historic arrangements that protect their rights and give them a voice through their union. “It is postal workers who keep this company going and this country connected – it’s time management recognise this, drop the nasty games and begin taking negotiations seriously, so that this dispute can be ended for good.”  A Royal Mail spokesperson said: “We entered facilitated talks through Acas in good faith, believing that the CWU were serious in their claim that they wanted a resolution. “In announcing further damaging strike action, the CWU have shown they are not interested in resolving this dispute and continue to focus on damaging our business further. “The CWU’s misguided belief that further industrial action will remove the need for change and force an improved offer is misleading its members and risking their long-term job security.""  The company said that the union's 18 days of industrial action have resulted in £200million in losses in the year to date and cost their people around £1,800 in lost pay.  They added: “We need to agree on changes to make our business more competitive. That is the only way to secure well-paid, long-term job security for our people. “In a materially loss-making company, with every additional day of strike action, we are facing the difficult choice of whether we spend our money on pay and protecting jobs or on the cost of strikes. “We remain committed to talks and urge the CWU to withdraw these strikes for the good of our customers and our people.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-royal-mail-announces-fresh-29117951
Alex Murdaugh 'changed his shirt' the night he is accused of shooting son and wife dead,"The Snapchat videos, sent by murdered 22-year-old Paul, have been shown in court with a witness saying it places Alex Murdaugh at the scene shortly before the killingsNew footage of Alex Murdaugh has emerged from the night his wife and son were shot to death showing he changed his shirt around the time they were killed. Murdaugh, 54, is currently standing trial, charged with murdering wife Maggie., 52 and son Paul, 22, at the family's hunting lodge in Islandton, South Carolina, US, on June 7 2021. He denies the murders saying he was visiting his elderly mum at the time. Now the jury have been shown a Snapchat video appearing to show the accused wearing a different shirt hours before the killing occurred. A number of videos sent by Paul have been presented as evidence. One sent at 7.56pm shows the 22-year-old riding around the family's hunting estate with Alex.   The video also shows Alex trying to plant a tree on the property and shows him wearing a light blue shirt and khaki trousers. Investigators believe Paul and Maggie were killed between 9 and 9.30pm. This video is just the latest shown in court with a previous one placing Murdaugh at the scene moments before the killings took place, prosecutors say. Another video taken by Paul at 8.44pm at the kennel, allegedly proves that Maggie, Paul and Alex were still together then.  In court Rogan Gibson, who described the Murdaughs as his ""second family"", listened to the video and told jurors he was positive he could hear Paul, Maggie and Alex. Paul was looking after Mr Gibson's dog at the time. This testimony contradicts Murdaugh's claim he last saw Maggie and Paul while they were having supper at the house. Murdaugh sobbed as the video of Paul playing with the dog was played.  He has claimed he was visiting his mum, who is in the late stages of Alzheimer's disease, about a 15-minute drive away. At 10.07pm, Murdaugh called 911 claiming he had arrived home to find his wife and son shot dead. Murdaugh called police at 10.07pm claiming he had come home from his mum's house to find his wife and son lying dead.  He later told police he had rolled the bloodied body of Paul over while trying to find a pulse. But bodycam footage shows him wearing a pristine white t-shirt, different to the top seen on earlier. Prosecutors pointed out to the jury the change of clothes but offered no explanation to it. Murdaugh's defence lawyers also have not explained the outfit change.  The judge is also set to rule if prosecutors will be able to tell the jury about the wider financial and legal predicaments he was in. The suspect has also been charged with embezzling millions. Prosecutors claim Murdaugh killed his family members to distract from a number of other charges from money laundering to trying to get a man to fatally shoot him so his surviving son could collect a $10million (£8.14m) life insurance policy. The two victims were shot with two different guns, with lawyers saying the force of the shots caused such bad damage to Paul that his brain was blasted right out of his skull.  When crime scene photos were shown to the court, Murdaugh became visibly upset. On the first day of the trial defence lawyer Dick Harpootlian said the blast from the shotgun used in the killing ""literally exploded his head like a watermelon hit with a sledgehammer"". Murdaugh could be seen crying when his lawyer discussed the details. Also brought up was how clean Murdaugh appeared to be in initial interviews with police despite claims he had checked his wife and son for a pulse and had turned his son over.

Mummified woman found on mountain thought to be climber missing for 40 years,"Marta Emilia Altamirano is believed to have fallen hundreds of metres to her death, according to the sister. Four expeditions have previously tried to find her with no success in the Andes in ArgentinaA mummified woman found on mountain is thought to be a climber missing for over 40 years. Marta Emilia Altamirano, better known as Patty, died during an expedition in the Andes in March 1981. She was then aged 20 and slipped on ice at an altitude of around 5,000 metres. Marta is believed to have fallen hundreds of metres to her death, according to the sister who accompanied her. At least four expeditions have taken place over the years to find the young woman’s body, however without any success. Over the years, the search was dropped and her disappearance became a legend in the mountain village of Barreal in Argentina’s San Juan province. Part of the story includes Patty’s father, a retired police officer who searched for her body for many years until eventually passing away in the town where she stayed for the last time.   But on 28 January a body was found on the Cerro Mercedario, the highest peak of the Cordillera de la Ramada range and the eighth-highest mountain in the Andes. It was discovered at an altitude of around 5,000 metres and was first presumed to be a German mountaineer called Andreas Colli who disappeared in the area in 2002. But it was soon confirmed the mummified remains belonged to a woman aged between 18 and 30 years.  The climber’s body was found attached to a glacier and the authorities had to break the ice to extract it. According to a news report of the time, Patty embarked on the fateful expedition with her sister Corina and experienced climber Sergio Bossini on 23 March 1981 from Barreal. A guide accompanied the group part of the way before they continued alone.  On the evening of March 24 that year, the trio set up base at the foot of a glacier at an altitude of 4,300 metres. They then embarked on their ascent to the summit three days later and stopped to set up camp on the ice at an altitude of over 5,000 metres at around 7pm. According to the report, Patty went off to survey the surrounding area alone and lost her footing, sliding hundreds of metres down an icy slope. Corina and Sergio searched for her throughout the night, but to no avail. They managed to find her the following morning, but Patty had already passed away.  Because of the weather conditions and difficult terrain, the pair decided they would not be able to bring her body back with them so they left to ask for help. Corina and Sergio arrived at the nearest gendarmerie post on 29 March 1981 to report the tragedy. However, snow and ice had buried Patty’s body in the time it took the authorities to assemble a search team and they were unable to find her. Another search operation was organised the following year, but again with no luck. In the subsequent years, at least two other search operations were carried out to find Patty’s remains. Doctor Jorge Prieto, who took part in the second search operation, said after the mummified body was found last week: “There is no doubt that it is her. I am absolutely sure. “There is no other missing person, much less a woman. Everything matches.” Orlando Bravo, a family friend and experienced climber who also took part in the search operations in the early 80s, said: “I’ve spoken with Patty’s brother and they are considering coming to San Juan. “I’m concerned about the emotional state of all of them. We are all very surprised.” He added: “This is all very strong for the family. We have to wait for them to identify the body. But it is also about closing a chapter. Over 41 years have passed.” The results of forensic tests on the mummified body have yet to be announced. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/mummified-woman-found-mountain-thought-29118025
Amateur detectorists 'can't believe it' as medieval coins haul declared £150k treasure,"An 'extremely rare' collection of coins discovered by amateur detectorists in Buckinghamshire have been officially declared as treasure worth a whopping £150,000A hoard of over 600 medieval coins found by amateur detectorists has been declared treasure after it was valued at around £150,000. Seven men more used to digging up shotgun shells and thimbles unearthed the “Hambleden Hoard” on a Buckinghamshire estate four years ago. The 627 coins include 12 rare gold nobles from the reign of Edward III, classed as “extremely rare” by the British Museum. The gold and silver ­collection is the biggest to be found in the UK for a decade. An inquest at Beaconsfield coroners court has now classed it as treasure. A report by Dr Barrie Cook, a curator at the British Museum, found the 12 gold nobles date from 1346 to 1351 — with only 12 known examples found in a 1963 survey.   The rest of the hoard — 547 silver pennies from the reigns of Edward I and II, 21 Irish pennies, 20 continental coins and 27 Scottish pennies from the reign of Alexander III, John Balliol and Robert the Bruce — were more common. The museum will now negotiate a settlement with the finders and landowners. The hoard was found at an organised rally near the village of Hambleden by Andrew Winter, Dom Rapley, Eryk Wierucki, Jaroslaw Giedyna, Dariusz Fijalkowski and brothers Tobiasz and Mateusz Nowak. They slept in a tent to stop thieves at Culden Faw Estate. Rules of detecting state that anything consisting of over three coins is classed as a hoard and must be declared to organisers. Dariusz, 47, of Bristol said yesterday that he would use any proceeds of the find to treat his family.  He said: “I am happy it has been declared as treasure. It has taken such a long time to hear this. Maybe some day we will find out how it ended up there.” The coins would be worth about £6 in today’s money.  Dariusz Fijalkowski, a machine operator from Bristol, said: “When I found the coins I was shouting so much because I was so excited. To see what we found, I still can’t believe it.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/amateur-detectorists-cant-believe-it-29119049
Labour MP makes gun reform plea and says laws needed to tackle incel violence,"Labour's Luke Pollard says thousands of pump-action guns must be removed from UK homes, while misogynistic violence should be treated as a hate crime to prevent a repeat of the sickening Plymouth murdersThousands of pump-action guns must be removed from UK homes, while violent misogyny should be treated as a hate crime to prevent a repeat of the Plymouth murders, an MP warns. Labour's Luke Pollard urged Parliament to back his radical shake-up of gun regulations, which is set to be heard on Friday. Mr Pollard, who represents Keyham - where the 2021 atrocity claimed five innocent lives, including a three-year-old girl - says not enough is being done to tackle incel radicalisation. He told The Mirror he hopes MPs back his Keyham's Law, which would outlaw dangerous weapons from homes and start to address the dangers of violent misogyny. He said: ""These streets where the shootings happened could be any streets in the country but they were our streets, and it gives us the responsibility to say never again. We've got to learn the lessons from that.""   The MP, whose private member's bill is re-listed in the Commons, continued: ""There is no reason these guns should be in people's homes."" Killer Jake Davison, who had posted misogynistic material on social media before the August 2021 shootings, murdered five people, including his mum Maxine and three-year-old Sophie Martyn. The 22-year-old had a licence to possess a shotgun. Last year there were 23,955 current certificates for pump action shotguns and 1,918 certificates for pump action rifles in England. Under Mr Pollard's private member's bill, which is listed for a second reading, it would be illegal to bring a pump-action gun into the home, except for those with legitimate reasons like farmers and pet controllers. He said: ""After Dunblane the country took steps to ban the possession of handguns in the wider public. We still as a nation perform really well at the Olympics with shooting sports but the people who do that go to a gun club where guns are safely and securely held, where transit is properly licenced and where they can enjoy their sport without hurting anyone else. ""We've established that principle for handguns, what I'm arguing for is that pump action weapons sit as a separate category to shotguns.  ""I'm not convinced there's ever a need to have a pump action weapon in someone's home. The ability to shoot a number of rounds very quickly is something that is concerning."" Mr Pollard also hopes classing violent misogyny as a hate crime will lead to greater understanding of how to prevent radicalisation. ""The lack of action on incels is a serious and growing problem,"" he said. ""We don't have a strategy for incels in the UK, we don't have a plan for identifying them or how we rescue our young people who go down the hole. ""The more I look into it, the darker the world of incels is and the more urgent the action is to address it. ""There's radicalisation going on in bedrooms around the country that parents can't see that we don't have a strategy for and we don't know how to rescue people from.""  He said that while an inquest - which is currently ongoing - into the killings will shed light on ways Davison could have been stopped, politicians have their role to play too. One proposal that has already been taken on board since Mr Pollard first proposed the law last year is the linking of GP records with gun ownership. This means that if a registered gun owner is identified as having a mental health problem, this can be flagged to police. But Mr Pollard believes there's still a long way to go. Asked what his message was for fellow MPs, Mr Pollard said: ""This could happen in any of our constituencies, any one of our communities. Tragedies like this are horrible and thankfully rare, but because it's happened once it can happen again. ""Taking time to work out causes of it is right, but there are things that Parliament should be doing to keep people safe.""

Meet the Labour candidate hoping to oust Boris Johnson at the next election,"Labour councillor Danny Beales, who grew up in Uxbridge and South Ruislip before being made homeless at the age of 14, is aiming to overturn Boris Johnson's 7,210 majority at the next election Boris Johnson's rival in his west London constituency has insisted the seat is “winnable” for Labour - but the party faces an “incredibly tough” battle.  Danny Beales, 34, who was selected in December to face the ex-Prime Minister at the next election, told The Mirror he wanted to give the area a “full-time MP”. The Labour challenger said that under Mr Johnson, people in Uxbridge and South Ruislip ""feel like they don’t have an MP” and are struggling to get surgery advice appointments. The Camden councillor, who grew up in the area before being made homeless at the age of 14, is now aiming to overturn the former PM’s 7,210 majority. While the constituency has only returned Tory MPs since its creation in 2010, the mood nationally has switched dramatically over the past 12 months.  The latest Ipsos poll gave Keir Starmer a massive 25-point lead over Rishi Sunak ’s Tories - with some raising the prospect of a 1997-style victory for Labour.  Mr Beales said there is a “lot of anger and frustration” with the Tories. “Knocking on doors a lot of former Tory voters are unhappy,” he told The Mirror at Millers Tap on Uxbridge High Street this week.

  “They are clearly saying they don’t want to vote Tory, they’re thinking about not voting Tory - some of them for the first time.”  After the disaster of Liz Truss’s short-lived Government, one man told him: “‘I call myself a Tory and always voted Tory, but I don’t think I can vote for them again after everything that has happened’”.  “My sense is that this seat is winnable,"" Mr Beales added. ""But you’re not going to sleep walk into being the Labour MP here."" “I don’t think we can take it for granted. Things can shift. Maybe polling can shift, national events can shift."" In recent weeks, rumours have circulated Westminster that the ex-PM Mr Johnson may flee the constituency in search for a safer Tory seat.  Does Mr Beales think he will stand? “He’s said he would. I normally take everyone at their word - but that’s very hard with Boris Johnson.”  But if Mr Johnson remains, he will find it “difficult” to win at the next election, according to the polling expert Professor Sir John Curtice.  He told The Mirror: “It will be very, very surprising if he [Johnson] held onto the seat at the moment. “He, like lots of other Conservatives, needs his party to recover nationally in order to have some chance of hanging onto their seat at the next election.” Professor Curtice added: “They [Tories] have got a battle on their hands to win more than half of the seat they currently hold at the next election”. The Labour candidate also told The Mirror he first became homeless when he was around 14-years-old. His mum had lost her job at the funeral directors - directly below the Rusilip flat they both lived in.  Without any prospect of a council house and his mum unable to afford the rent, “we packed up and moved to Northampton”, he said. Following a short stint at his grandparents home they eventually moved back into the private rental sector - but were soon again facing homelessness. “My mum lost her job another time,” he added. After several months in temporary accommodation - a B&B - they eventually moved into a council house in the area. Mr Beales’s experience of homelessness is one of the reasons he is running at the next election. “To deal with those things I think we need people in Parliament who understand the problems, have experience of them, and are generally committed to changing them,” he said. Asked whether politics was a talking point in the family, he replied: “No. Religion, politics, money - just don’t discuss it. It’s not to be discussed. “The News at Six was always on in the background - there were various tuts that were had. We haven’t generally talked about politics as a family”. Unlike the ex-Prime Minister, who grew up wanting to be “world king”, his Labour challenger said his “obsession” was to be either a doctor or policeman. He eventually had a two-year stint as a special police constable in Westminster, but said he felt “frustrated that I couldn’t change the situation”.  “You’re dealing with incredibly difficult situations. But you’re not dealing with the causes of those,” he said. Before becoming a councillor in Camden, Mr Beales also worked for the ex-Northampton North Labour MP Sally Keeble between 2008-10 - the final years of the last Labour Government.  “It was a tough time in the Labour Party,” he said. “A lot of people saw the writing on the wall. It was a marginal constituency, she did end up losing the seat.  “It wasn’t kind of a party on the up, rimming with possibility. It was like a crisis, control situation. It was a tough period”. He added: “She would work incredibly hard, incredibly long hours trying to keep her seat. She was a good constituency MP.” “For a long time I thought that’s not for me - tough being away from family. I haven’t been someone who has been bursting to be a Member of Parliament for their whole life and forever.” But now - over 10 years later - he believes Labour is pursuing the right strategy. “From my perspective it's vital we have a Labour Government to make the changes we need to make,” he said. “Every seat really does matter. This seat really does matter. I think we need to win this seat for sure.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/meet-labour-candidate-hoping-oust-29118415
Christian mum suing school after son 'forced into LGBT parade' blasts 'bully' headteacher,"Devoutly Christian mum Izzy Montague has claimed Heavers Farm Primary School in South Norwood is ""corrupt"", saying that her ""issue was forcing children to parade for LGBT""The devoutly Christian mum suing a London primary school over an LGBT parade has claimed in court that the headteacher is a 'bully' and the school is corrupt. Izzy Montague, 38, first made the headlines three years ago after appearing on Good Morning Britain and claiming teaching children about the LGBT community in school is morally wrong and taxpayers' money shouldn't go towards pushing the ""gay agenda"".  Now, the mum is suing Heavers Farm Primary School in South Norwood, southeast London, after claiming her four-year-old son was forced to take part in a school LGBT parade. In court she accused headteacher Susan Papas of being a bully, saying that the school is corrupt after she informed them she wanted her son out of the event in June 2018 - but was refused. After an invitation was sent out to parents, the mum said she contacted the school asking for her son's attendance to be excused, saying the ""issue was forcing children to parade for LGBT"". And following the school's refusal, Ms Montague called for the resignation of Ms Papas.    The first-of-its-kind case is being heard at the Central Criminal Court, Old Bailey - where it will last from Wednesday February 1 to February 10. Continuing her evidence today, the devout mum told the court: ""I believe anyone who decided that children should march for LGBT should not be a head of a primary school."" Cross-examining Mrs Montague, Ian Clarke, representing the school, asked the mum whether she called on the headteacher's resignation, even before the pair met. Mr Clarke asked: ""So, even before you meet with Ms Papas you are calling for her resignation. ""Given this was before you had any contact with the school in terms of the complaint no one from the leadership team had spoken to you about the contents of the parade?"" Mrs Montague replied: ""I feel the issue wasn't about the curriculum, the issue was forcing children to parade for LGBT. None of which had changed after the complaint had been made. ""She supported the idea children should march for LGBT that was before the complaint, and was still supported by her after the complaint, nothing had changed."" The primary school's representative then said the mother ""contacted the press before the complaint"" and even used a false name in case of any ""repercussions"" from the school, adding: ""But at this point you would have had no repercussions as you hadn't contacted the school?"" However, the 38-year-old argued: ""The fact my child wasn't excused from the event had occurred, so that's why I had contacted the newspapers. In my eyes, my child had already been excluded.""  The pair then discussed how if her four-year-old son came into school, ""he would have had to march"", with Mrs Montague replying the reason she used a fake name was because she ""didn't want to be intimated or abused."" She added: ""I would have been scared that if the school had found out I had made these comments in the newspaper they would have intimated me and victimised my child and create more abuse."" Calling on evidence provided, Mr Clarke said that an email was sent to the school on July 13, requesting Mrs Montague clarify the phrasing she used, and asked if she could have written it in a ""more neutral fashion."" The mum said: ""I think how I phrased it, yes, I understand how it could be viewed or seen as an uncomfortable read and not very pleasant to Susan Papas. But at the time and even now I was trying to be as truthful as possible about how I felt."" ""And you accuse Ms Papas of being a bully and head of a corrupt organisation...Ms Papas hasn't bullied you at any point, has she?"" asked Mr Clarke. Mrs Montague said: ""My view is forcing someone to follow something against their wishes, I think that is bullying."" The school's representative fired back: ""Is the school corrupt?"" She replied: ""It sold itself as welcoming to the community, but it certainly wasn't welcoming to my family and our Christian views, and I think that's a form of corruption."" The barrister touched on the mum's claims that Ms Papas' comments are ""Christian-phobic"", yet gave no concrete example of such comments.  Mrs Montague said: ""Homophobia is a mental illness so saying anyone who has Christian values is basically saying they have a mental illness."" She added: ""All I've stated is my child can't attend because they are Christian, this somehow defines they are not adhering to laws or being diverse, that in my view is Christian-phobic."" Heavers Farm Primary School's representative went on to ask what Mrs Montague thinks Pride is all about.   Mrs Montague replied: ""I believe it is about having gay liberation, being able to freely sleep and have sex with whoever you want without facing discrimination and the threat of violence or being put into prison. ""It breaks down the idea that sex should be contained in marriage and that sexual ideologies should be free."" And when asked what she disagrees with in that understanding of Pride, she said: ""'I believe that a man and woman should have sexual relations in marriage so there is no freedom in that. We don't go around having sex whenever we want with whoever we want. ""I believe that as a Christian I should bring as many people as possible to Christ. So, it's not something I would be preaching to people that you should be free to have sex with whoever you want, whilst I wouldn't chastise it I certainly wouldn't celebrate it."" In ending the conversation, the barrister asked whether the only resolution the mum saw fit for her son was for him to be excused from any lessons that contradicted her faith. ""I did follow the Human Right Acts... so yes, I felt it was more than reasonable to say that if you were going to introduce topics that weren't in line with my faith, he be removed,"" the mother replied. A spokesperson for Heavers Farm Primary School told The Mirror: “Following a series of matters taking place in 2018, we have engaged as required with the process of a civil claim and given the ongoing legal proceedings, it would not be appropriate for us to comment further at this stage.” Mrs Montague, supported by the Christian Legal Centre, is suing the school on the grounds of direct and indirect discrimination, victimisation, and breach of statutory duty under the Education Act 1996 and the Human Rights Act 1998. It is the first time that a UK court will scrutinise the legality of imposing LGBT ideology on primary schools. The hearing continues.

More than half of voters want a general election now as Rishi Sunak drowns in sleaze,"The Redfield and Wilton poll for the Mirror found a whopping 52% believe Parliament should call a general election now with only 32% opposed. Four in 10 think Rishi Sunak does not have a mandate to governVoters are demanding a general election now as Rishi Sunak’s government drowns in sleaze. More than half want to head to the ballot box to have a say on who runs the country. The survey, conducted for the Mirror by Redfield and Wilton, shows around four in 10 (41%) believe the PM does not have a mandate to govern. Only 31% disagree. Mr Sunak was handed the keys of No10 in October without a single vote being cast by Tory MPs, party members or the public. He has binned the Conservatives’ 2019 election manifesto as well as the pledges he made in the leadership contest in the summer. Asked which party they associate with sleaze, 38% said Tories compared to only 9% who picked Labour. Around a fifth (19%) said both parties, while 11% chose neither.   The Prime Minister, who marked 100 days in office today promised to lead a government with “integrity, professionalism and accountability” at every level. But he has faced a series of sleaze scandals. Gavin Williamson resigned from Cabinet after just two weeks after he faced bullying claims. Deputy PM Dominic Raab is currently being investigated over complaints he bullied dozens of civil servants. Mr Sunak was criticised for appointing Suella Braverman as Home Secretary just six days after she was sacked from the job for leaking. The PM last month was fined by the police for failing to wear a seat belt as he filmed an Instagram video in the back of the car. And Conservative Party chairman Nadhim Zahawi was sacked last weekend for attempting to hide the truth about not paying enough in tax.  Critics have warned that the country is broken after 13 years of Tory rule. The NHS is suffering its worst crisis in history as patients face record waiting lists and there are delays in ambulances getting to the seriously ill. Mr Sunak has been criticised for failing to negotiate an end to the strikes across the public sector, including the health service, schools and railways. In the poll yesterday, asked whether Parliament should call a general election now, a whopping 52% said yes with 32% opposed. Mr Sunak was beaten by Liz Truss in the race to become Tory leader in the summer. She was forced to stand down after just 49 days when her catastrophic mini-Budget caused economic carnage. Mr Sunak was crowned as her replacement after Boris Johnson and Penny Mordaunt withdrew from the contest to succeed her. He won by default without receiving a single vote or uttering a single word in public. During the contest, his only public statements were a 166-word written message launching his campaign and a 66-word tweet after Mr Johnson withdrew. More than 149,000 people have now signed the Mirror's petition on the 38 Degrees website calling for a general election now. :: Redfield and Wilton interviewed 1,500 adults in Britain online on February 2.

Nadine Dorries predicts Dominic Raab will quit over 'avalanche' of allegations,"The former Culture Secretary said that she would step down to defend herself if she were in Mr Raab's situation, amid questions over how much Rishi Sunak knew about allegations when he appointed him Nadine Dorries has said she would quit if she was Dominic Raab, as the deputy PM battles an ""avalanche"" of bullying allegations.   Pressure is mounting on Rishi Sunak to suspend him, as claims emerged that the cabinet secretary was aware of accusations before Mr Raab was brought back into the cabinet.   Meanwhile anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller claimed the top Tory had made her feel ""bullied and demeaned"" in an encounter at the BBC.  Mr Raab has denied any wrongdoing as an independent lawyer investigates eight formal complaints believed to involve dozens of civil servants. Last night his former cabinet colleague said she didn't think it would be long before he quit.   Ms Dorries told TalkTV that while her dealings with Mr Raab had been ""positive"", she thinks he will get to the position where he decides to quit ""pretty soon"". She said:: ""If I were Dominic Raab and I was under this avalanche of accusations being made against me I think I would want to stand down, I would want to dedicate my time to clearing my name and refuting those allegations. ""And I think Dominic's probably going to get to that position pretty soon."" The Prime Minister is under pressure to reveal how much he knew about allegations about Mr Raab's conduct. The Times reports that cabinet secretary Simon Case was informed of a written complaint about him months before he was reappointed by Mr Sunak last year. He was reportedly told that the allegations were being ""taken seriously"".  And anti-Brexit activist Ms Miller has accused Mr Raab of an ""abusive attack"" in the build-up to the 2016 referrendum. Writing in The Independent she claimed she saw him shouting ""get me a f***** car"" at a ""shaking"" young man outside the studio. She said: ""Raab was aggressive and intimidating, and I was bullied and demeaned.  ""This was an aggressive male expressing seemingly misogynistic behaviour.""  Earlier this week The Mirror reported witnesses also claim the Deputy PM would switch his anger on and off depending on whether it was civil ­servants or ministers in the room.  Mr Raab's spokesman has ­previously said he “looks forward to answering the ­allegations made of him directly”. Mr Raab insisted last week: “I’m ­confident I behaved professionally, and of course the ­Government takes a ­zero-tolerance approach to bullying.” Mr Sunak has tasked lawyer Adam Tolley KC with investigating bullying claims against Mr Raab, with dozens of civil servants believed to be involved in eight formal complaints.

Rishi Sunak says he won't 'unleash a torpedo' at Boris Johnson for 'acting like PM',"The jet-setting former Tory leader has been active on the world stage in recent weeks, meeting politicians in Ukraine and the US despite holding no role in government, but Mr Sunak told Piers Morgan he doesn't have an issue with itRishi Sunak has brushed off any suggestion he should ""unleash a torpedo"" to remind Boris Johnson who's Prime Minister. The jet-setting former Tory leader has been active on the world stage in recent weeks, meeting politicians in Ukraine and the US despite holding no role in government. He's been a thorn in Mr Sunak's side, criticising the government for not sending fighter jets to Ukraine amid speculation he's maintaining his profile for a future leadership bid. Piers Morgan asked Mr Sunak if he was bothered by his predecessor-but-one being ""on manoeuvres"" and ""acting like he's still Prime Minister"" - and questioned whether he should be put back in his place. Downing Street said Mr Johnson has been acting ""in his own capacity"" when he piled pressure on the government to supply fighter jets to Ukraine after meeting President Volodymyr Zelensky During an interview on TalkTV Mr Morgan asked Mr Sunak whether the time had come to ""unleash a torpedo to remind him who's the Prime Minister?""   But the Prime Minister, whose resignation sparked a crisis which helped to topple Mr Johnson, took a diplomatic approach. Mr Sunak responded: ""No I think it's great that we've got former Prime Ministers and I speak to all our former leaders actually."" Pressed on whether Mr Johnson should be doing what he's doing, the PM replied: ""I think all of our leaders have a way of continuing to contribute to public life and that's a good thing... they've got experience that they want to share."" Asked if he had a problem with his predecessor but-one's activities he said: ""No, gosh, we've got a long list of previous Prime Ministers and the fact they still want to contribute to public life is great."" Downing Street has highlighted the complexities of training Ukrainian pilots to fly the RAF's Typhoon and F-35 planes. Mr Sunak argued they ""are incredibly sophisticated pieces of equipment that require months if not years for people to be trained on"".  But asked if he could rule out supplying them in the future, he said: ""No, we're always in a dialogue with our Ukrainian friends about what the right way to support them is."" The ex-Prime Minister used a surprise trip to the US to condemn his old Cabinet colleague's decision not to arm Kyiv with warplanes - only hours after Downing Street said the idea was ""not practical"". Asked about fighter jets, he told Fox News: ""Save time, save money, save lives. Give the Ukrainians what they need as fast as possible. Get this thing done. Forget about Putin."" He added: ""Every time we’ve said it would be a mistake to give such and such weaponry to Ukraine, we ended up doing it."" It marks Mr Johnson's latest intervention over the UK's support for Ukraine, which he regards as a key part of his legacy in Downing Street. The former PM made an unannounced visit to Ukraine last month where he met President Volodymyr Zelensky and visited Bucha and Borodyanka to the north of Kyiv, the scenes of some of the worst atrocities committed by Russian forces. Downing Street rejected calls again on Wednesday to supply Ukraine with British fighter jets. Asked about the former prime minister's trip to the US, Rishi Sunak's official spokesman said: ""The Prime Minister welcomes all colleagues' backing for Ukraine and is pleased the former prime minister is continuing his staunch support of the United Kingdom's efforts to help Ukraine secure a lasting peace."" But he said that Mr Johnson is ""acting in his own capacity and not on behalf of the UK Government"". On Tuesday, Downing Street said training Volodymyr Zelensky's forces on Typhoons and F-35s would take too long, but it does not oppose allies sending their own jets.

"Russia 'resorting to First World War-style attacks' in Ukraine, says Defence Secretary","Amid mounting pressure on the West to supply Kyiv with fighter jets, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace warned that even if the UK agreed to send British warplanes 'tomorrow' it would take 'months' to train Ukrainian pilots to fly them Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has compared the brutal conflict in Ukraine with the misery of the First World War.   Speaking after talks with his Australian counterpart in Portsmouth, the Cabinet Minister likened the fighting with Russia to the 1914-18 Great War.  Amid mounting pressure on the West to supply Kyiv with fighter jets, Mr Wallace warned that even if the UK agreed to send British warplanes “tomorrow” it would take “months” to train Ukrainian pilots to fly them. He admitted: “There is no magic wand.” Defending the West’s decision not to send fighter jets yet, former Scots Guards officer Mr Wallace said the Ukrainians need “the ability to form military formations on the ground” to “push back Russian forces”. “That is how you defeat the human wave attacks the Russians are currently having to resort to - and they are resorting to First World War level type of attacks, with subsequent casualties to match,” he said.   “Young men and women of Ukraine are trying to get up, march forward and take territory back from Russians. “That is what they are doing every day - as we stand here right now - and are taking losses as a result.”  Downing Street and the White House have so far ruled out sending fighter planes to Kyiv, despite President Volodymyr Zelensky’s growing calls for aircraft.  However, Mr Wallace has signalled the UK could eventually agree. “I’m very open to examining all sorts of systems, not just jets - but these things don't always happen overnight,” he said. “But I can say we’re not putting Ukrainians at risk.  “Even if tomorrow morning we announced we were going to put them in fast jets, that would take months - you're suddenly having to learn to pilot a fast jet, so there is no magic wand in this horrendous conflict.”  The warning was a slap down to former Prime Minister Boris Johnson who earlier this week insisted RAF jets such as the Typhoon would not be too complicated for Ukrainian airmen.  He told the Washington-based Atlantic Council think tank: “I take that argument with a bit of a pinch of salt.” Pointing to the success of Polish pilots flying RAF planes in the Battle of Britain in 1940, Mr Johnson added: “It didn’t take long for those Polish pilots to work out how to use a Hawker Hurricane or a Spitfire and I don’t think it would take the Ukrainians long to work out how to use F-16s or Typhoons or whatever we have to give them.” But slapping down his former boss, Mr Wallace said today: “It’s easy to get carried away.” Mr Wallace also revealed Ukrainian troops began training on British Challenger 2 tanks on Monday. The UK is sending 14 of the fearsome vehicles to Kyiv to bolster Ukrainian efforts to repel Russian invaders. Mr Wallace was speaking alongside Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong and the country’s Deputy PM and Defence Secretary Richard Marles at Portsmouth’s iconic Spinnaker Tower. Their wide-ranging discussions - part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing security alliance - also focused on the Aukus defence pact, which includes the US and is aimed at providing Canberra with nuclear-powered submarines.

'We can all strike back at Rich Rishi Sunak at the local elections and turf Tories out',"The Government is not listening to the cries of anguish from striking workers, Paul Routledge says, but they will be fearing the local elections, where we can all make them sweatWalkout Wednesday was billed as “a General Strike in all but name” by those wishing it to fail. It was nothing of the sort. Millions went to work as normal, especially in the private sector.  In atrocious weather, I walked to the two schools in my village. No picket lines of striking teachers in what were once playgrounds full of cars. Action, what action?  But the day was still a momentous show of anger at government indifference to the plight of workpeople suffering a Tory cost of living crisis.  Right across the public services, in universities, on the railways and even customs officers in stormy Shetland, they came out in protest at Rich Rishi Sunak’s austerity.  In some ways, I wish it HAD been a general strike, though that would be illegal under Tory anti-union laws. This Government will not listen to cries of anguish from parents, workers and the vast class of the underpaid, most of whom do not have the protection of a union.  Like Thatcher and her poll tax, they will only give way when forced to do so by public unrest.  Today’s strikers must understand – like the miners grasped in 1984 – that if you take on the state, the state will use every coercive means to defeat you. Who is the state? “C’est moi” said Louis XIV of France. “It’s me.” Here, it’s Sunak. But he isn’t a monarch. He is a puppet of the rabidly anti-union, anti-worker Conservative Party, and he can be defeated by unrest – at the ballot box. The season of strikes looks set to continue at least until the spring. Local elections are due on May 4, less than 100 days away. Every single vote must be mobilised then to turn the Tories out of town halls, everywhere. Electoral annihilation is something even this brutish, couldn’t-care-less lot fears.",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/we-can-strike-back-rich-29116073
"UK heading for recession - but won't be as bad as expected, says Bank of England","The Bank of England warned that an economic slump is looming but it will be shorter and shallower than predicted thanks to falling energy prices and inflation starting to easeThe UK is hurtling towards a recession but it won't be as bad as predicted, the Bank of England has said. It said that the UK is still headed for an economic slump over five consecutive quarters, starting in the first three months of 2023. But the Bank said it could be shallower and shorter than previously expected as wholesale energy prices begin to fall and soaring inflation starts to ease. The UK was previously expected to enter a recession at the end of 2022, with the downturn lasting until mid-2024. It is now expected to run from the first three months of this year into the middle of next year. Decision makers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) hiked interest rates to 4% today - the tenth rise in a row - to help bring down inflation. When the base rate goes up, borrowing money becomes more expensive - in bad news for homeowners with variable rate mortgages.   Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said inflation was the ""biggest threat to living standards in a generation"" and said the Government would continue to resist calls for extra spending or tax cuts. His words are likely to anger some Tory MPs who are urging the Government to reduce the tax burden faced by Brits. But Mr Hunt, who was brought in to solve the economic crisis triggered by ex-PM Liz Truss's disastrous stint in No10, has been resisting pressure to act in next month's Budget. He also said the Government couldn't fund additional spending in a blow to unions pushing for public sector pay rises. In a statement, Mr Hunt said: “Inflation is a stealth tax that is the biggest threat to living standards in a generation, so we support the Bank's action today so we succeed in halving inflation this year.  “We will play our part by making sure government decisions are in lockstep with the Bank's approach, including by resisting the urge right now to fund additional spending or tax cuts through borrowing, which will only add fuel to the inflation fire and prolong the pain for everyone.”  Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said Brits would be worried about what rising interest rates will mean for their finances. “The reality is that under the Tories growth is on the floor, families are worse off and we are stuck in the global slow lane,"" she said. “We do not have to continue on this path of managed decline when Britain has so much potential to grow and thrive."" TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said the Bank of England was taking a ""very big risk"" with its latest rise in the cost of borrowing.  Mr Nowak said that it was now up to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to ensure the economy did not fall into recession. ""The IMF's recession forecast for the UK should have been cause for caution but the Bank has taken a very big risk by pushing rates up, and if we spend this year in recession, working people will pay a high price,"" he said. ""The Chancellor now bears responsibility for keeping us out of recession. He must respond at next month's budget with an urgent spending boost to keep the UK economy moving and to keep people's jobs safe. ""And he should start with funding for public sector pay rises that keep up with the cost of living."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/uk-heading-recession-wont-bad-29114738
All the scandals and sackings from Rishi Sunak's first 100 days in Downing Street,"Rishi Sunak promised to end to the chaos and sleaze that plagued the Tories when he entered No10 last year. But after 100 days in office, the scandals are still swirling around the PMRishi Sunak today marks 100 days in office after a bit of a bumpy start to life in No10.  He arrived into Downing Street in October after Liz Truss's government descended into chaos - and promised to end to the scandals that have plagued the Tories for year.   But the drama isn't going anywhere. Mr Sunak has already been forced to dispense with two cabinet members, while he is under intense pressure to show Dominic Raab the door.   The Prime Minister came under fierce criticism for bringing Home Secretary Suella Braverman back into the fold less than a week after she was sacked for a breach of the ministerial code.   On top of these headaches, he's dealing with dire poll ratings, rolling strike action, gloomy economic forecasts and the spectre of his predecessor plus-one, Boris Johnson. Here we look at some of the big moments of Mr Sunak's first 100 days.   Reappointing scandal-hit Suella Braverman Mr Sunak triggered anger only days into being Prime Minister when he reappointed Suella Braverman as Home Secretary in October. The scandal-hit Tory was forced to resign in the last days of Liz Truss's administration after it emerged that she'd sent highly sensitive official documents from her personal email. Mr Sunak reappointed her to the post when he took over only days later - despite concerns that she had broken the ministerial code.  Gavin Williamson quits over bullying allegations  Top Tory Sir Gavin Williamson was forced to resign as a minister in November - only two weeks into Mr Sunak's time in No10 -after ex-Chief Whip Wendy Morton complained about his sweary texts. Ms Morton made a complaint to Tory bosses about an expletive-filled exchange, where Sir Gavin moaned about not being given a seat at the Queen's funeral in September. He was also reported to the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS), which probes MPs conduct.  Mr Williamson was accused of telling a senior civil servant to ""slit your throat"" in front of colleagues during a meeting when he was Defence Secretary. In his resignation letter, Sir Gavin rejected the ""characterisation"" of the complaints but admitted ""these are becoming a distraction"". The South Staffordshire MP vowed to ""clear my name of any wrongdoing"". Probe into Dominic Raab's conduct Mr Sunak is under pressure to suspend Deputy PM Dominic Raab during an independent probe into allegations of bullying during his stints at three Government departments. Mr Raab, who is also the Justice Secretary, is facing eight formal complaints about his conduct, which are said to involve at least 24 staff.  The Mirror previously revealed that civil servants claim they suffered breakdowns and felt suicidal over the Deputy PM's alleged conduct- with staff saying working the Tory felt like being in a “controlling and abusive relationship”.  He denies accusations of bullying. He has ­previously said he “looks forward to answering the ­allegations made of him directly”. Mr Raab insisted last week: “I’m ­confident I behaved professionally, and of course the ­Government takes a ­zero-tolerance approach to bullying.” Sacking tax-row Tory Nadhim Zahawi  Tory Chairman Nadhim Zahawi was dramatically sacked at the weekend over a ""serious breach"" of the ministerial code involving his tax affairs. A massive row erupted when it emerged that Mr Zahawi had settled a multi-million tax dispute with HMRC - including a penalty - while he was Chancellor last summer.  Mr Sunak tasked his ethics advisor Sir Laurie Magnus to look into Mr Zahawi's tax affairs after coming under intense pressure to sack him. Sir Laurie ruled that Mr Zahawi should have come clean about his dealings with HMRC at multiple points, particularly when Liz Truss and then Rishi Sunak both gave him Government jobs. Mr Zahawi made no apology or mention of the breaches of the ministerial code in his letter to the Prime Minister but instead raised concerns about the conduct of the media.  Police fine over 'seatbelt-gate' The Prime Minister garnered his SECOND police fine while in Government through a bungled attempt to promote his levelling up agenda. On a visit to the North West, the hapless PM posted an Instagram video to tout new levelling up funds - but social media users spotted that he wasn't wearing a seatbelt. Wearing a seatbelt in a moving car is required by law, and failure to buckle up can carry a fine of up to £500.  Lancashire Police quickly ordered him to pay a fixed penalty notice, making him the second PM to get a fine while in office - after Boris Johnson, of course. No10 said he “fully accepts this was a mistake and has apologised”. Mr Sunak will pay the fine. He was previously handed a Partygate fine for attending a surprise birthday gathering for Boris Johnson in June 2020. Boris Johnson's Partygate 'lies' and loan row The shamed ex-Prime Minister is due to give evidence to the Commons Privileges Committee, which is probing whether he deliberately misled Parliament over Partygate. Mr Johnson repeatedly insisted no parties had taken place and no rules had been broken after the Mirror broke the story about lockdown gatherings in No10 and Whitehall. The Committee has not yet announced the timetable for its explosive hearings but it is understood to be planning to grill witnesses the run up to Easter.  In a headache for Mr Sunak, the Government's spending watchdog is examining the controversial decision to provide £220,000 of taxpayers’ money to fund Boris Johnson’s legal defence. Mr Johnson is also at the centre of a chaotic row over his finances which could also be a problem for the Government. BBC Chairman Richard Sharp has ordered ordered an internal inquiry into potential conflicts of interests amid claims he helped Boris Johnson to secure a loan of up to £800,000. Millionaire Sam Blyth, a relative of Mr Johnson, allegedly stepped in to act as a guarantor for up to £800,000 of credit to fund the ex-PM’s lavish lifestyle in 2020. He has admitted to introducing the ex-PM's distant Canadian cousin to Simon Case, who heads up the civil service.

Boris Johnson says he's learned to relax by painting COWS since leaving No10,"The former PM has spoken of his new-found hobby in an interview with former cabinet member Nadine Dorries, which is set to be screened tomorrow eveningBoris Johnson has found an unusual new hobby since being booted out of Number 10. The former PM is using his downtime to master his skills at painting cows, he told close ally Nadine Dorries in an interview to be screened tomorrow. Mr Johnson, now a backbench MP who has trousered more than £1 million giving speeches since he left Downing Street, said he's enjoying relaxing by learning to paint the farmyard animals. He told Ms Dorries: “I’ve got a project which is to master the form of the cow."" It's not the first time he's spoken about his love of painting. Back in 2019, when he was campaigning to succeed Theresa May as PM, he said he enjoyed relaxing by painting buses.   He told Talk Radio at the time: “I like to paint. Or I make things. I have a thing where I make models of buses. ""What I make is, I get old, I don’t know, wooden crates, and I paint them. It’s a box that’s been used to contain two wine bottles, right, and it will have a dividing thing. And I turn it into a bus.  “So I put passengers – I paint the passengers enjoying themselves on a wonderful bus – low carbon, of the kind that we brought to the streets of London, reducing C02, reducing nitrous oxide, reducing pollution.” The ex-Tory leader will be the first guest on new TalkTV show Friday Night With Nadine, airing at 8pm. During the interview, he will also defend himself against allegations of misleading Parliament, for which he is currently being investigated. Earlier today The Mirror reported that the government's spending watchdog is looking into whether billing taxpayers £220,000 defending Mr Johnson over the Partygate scandal is money well spent.   It emerged this week that legal fees had rocketed as the former Prime Minister battles allegations that he misled Parliament. Labour has piled pressure on Rishi Sunak to ""stand up"" to Mr Johnson and make him pay for it himself. Keir Starmer taunted him at PMQs this week, saying: ""Surely even this Prime Minister can put his foot down and stand up to his old boss and say he made this mess, he can pick up the bill?"" The National Audit Office (NAO) has now confirmed it is ""seeking further information"" and would be considering the matter as part of its audit. No decision has been made on whether to launch a formal investigation. In a clip released today the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip said: ""As you know there’s a Parliamentary Committee looking into some aspects of this and I had better be respectful of them. ""But I’ll just repeat what I've said before, and I hope it's obvious to everybody, that anybody who thinks I was knowingly going to parties that were breaking lockdown rules in No10, and then knowingly covering up parties that were illicit that other people were going to, that’s all strictly for the birds.

No decision has been made on whether to launch a formal investigation.   It follows a request by campaign group Unlock Democracy to look at whether the spending is a ""sensible and legitimate use of public money"". The Mirror previously revealed the estimated cost in defending the shamed former Prime Minister had soared by more than £90,000 since last summer. Mr Johnson, now a backbench MP, faces a probe over his denials of lockdown-busting gatherings in No10, with hearings likely to begin next month. He is being investigated by the House of Commons Privileges Committee, which will determine whether he committed contempt of Parliament - an allegation he denies. Solicitors firm Peters and Peters were awarded a contract worth £129,700 to provide Mr Johnson with advice during the investigation. Cabinet Office permanent secretary Alex Chisholm confirmed to MPs that the sum had risen dramatically, and could not guarantee it wouldn't go up even further.  An NAO spokesperson said: “The NAO received a query from a member of the public relating to our audit of Cabinet Office accounts.  ""We are seeking further information in response to the correspondence and will be considering the matter as part of our audit.” It has raised questions over whether Mr Johnson should be footing the bill himself, having raked in millions from speeches and an advance on his memoirs since leaving office. Former Lib Dem MP Tom Brake, who heads Democracy Unlocked, told The Guardian: “In these circumstances, and with public finances under huge pressure, the taxpayer shouldn’t underwrite his open-ended defence legal costs.  ""Fortunately for Johnson, thanks to his recent extra-parliamentary activities, he can afford to pay for them himself.” The NAO told Democracy Unlocked that it had been in touch with the Cabinet Office, The Guardian reports. The cost of the legal defence has sparked huge anger. Liberal Democrat Chief Whip Wendy Chamberlain previously said: ""While the British people battle with a cost-of-living crisis, this Conservative Government seems more interested in helping Boris Johnson with his cost-of-lying crisis. This is a sleazy new low for this Government, dragging politics into the gutter.""

Inquiry launched into Omagh bombing 25 years after IRA atrocity which killed 29,"Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris told the House of Commons that the probe will be set up following a court judgement compelling the government to investigateAn independent inquiry into the Omagh bombing which killed 29, including nine children and a woman pregnant with twins, will be launched 25 years after the Real IRA atrocity.  Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris told the House of Commons that the probe will be set up following a court judgement compelling the government to investigate. The announcement comes after bereaved dad Michael Gallagher, whose son Aiden died in the attack, took a legal challenge leading to the call for action. Mr Heaton-Harris said the investigation will focus on whether the bombing could have been avoided - and said he hopes it gives ""comfort"" to families. But the government was accused of inconsistency by not taking the same approach with other major incidents during the Northern Ireland Troubles. Mr Heaton-Harris told MPs: ""I have informed Mr Gallagher and members of the Omagh Support and Self Help Group, as well as representatives of Families Moving On of this decision.    ""The inquiry will focus specifically on the four grounds which the court held as giving rise to plausible arguments that the bombing could have been prevented."" He continued: ""I hope the decision to establish an independent statutory inquiry gives some comfort to those families who have long campaigned for this outcome. I recognise however, that not all families affected by the bombing desire such further investigation.  ""Some have worked hard to process their trauma and to move on with their lives and do not wish to re-examine the past. I hope that the targeted nature of the inquiry to allow it to answer the four points I mentioned earlier will provide the middle ground."" The next step, Mr Heaton-Harris said, will be to appoint the chair of the inquiry and finalise the terms of reference. Labour's shadow Northern Ireland secretary Peter Kyle welcomed the move - but said there is a ""clash"" between the Omagh decision and the approach to other Troubles killings.  He said: ""It's important to say that if the inquiry finds shortcomings in how the intelligence was used, it will not change the fact that it was republican terrorists who are ultimately responsible for the lives lost and changed that day."" Mr Kyle added that the Republic of Ireland has a ""moral obligation"" to start its own investigation. Controversial legislation put forward by the government would see a new body headed by a judge report on hundreds of killings carried out before the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. Perpetrators would be offered conditional amnesties, a move which has sparked outrage among the families of victims. Mr Kyle told the Commons: ""The fact the Secretary of State is calling for this inquiry does clash with the Government's overall approach to legacy issues. We oppose the Government's Legacy Bill because it provides more benefits to perpetrators than it does to victims of terror. ""The Secretary of State has put Omagh families at the heart of today's decision. I'm worried that other victims of atrocities during the Troubles will be watching and wondering why their loved ones are not being treated in a similar way?"" He added: ""A seesaw approach to policy isn't healthy in any circumstances, but least of all when dealing with the sensitivities of Northern Ireland's past. The Government has presented its logic as to why the atrocities committed in late 1998 qualify for a public inquiry, and those before don't. ""But it's a logic only understood within Whitehall. Many families... simply cannot see the logic of why the crimes that shattered their lives are undeserving of similar treatment to that announced today."" He went on: ""If he (Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris) is proceeding with a legacy approach he has inherited, he needs to be certain that it will provide the same comfort to and answers to all victims that he is offering the families of Omagh today.""

Union boss says civil servants working with Dominic Raab 'suffered mental health crises',"Rishi Sunak is under intense pressure to remove Mr Raab as deputy PM as eight formal complaints about alleged bullying are investigatedEmbattled Rishi Sunak has come under fresh attack as a union boss claimed civil servants have suffered mental health crises as a result of their treatment by Dominic Raab. The PM faces calls to sack Mr Raab, who is being investigated over multiple allegations of bullying - which he denies. FDA boss Dave Penman told Sky News today: ""I've spoken to people who are civil servants working and have worked for Dominic Raab, who have suffered mental health crises, have lost their careers essentially because they've had to move and change jobs."" Mr Penman has called for the deputy PM to be suspended while a probe is carried out, stating: ""If you're in a workplace where you're being bullied, where the daily grind of coming to work destroys your mental health, then that has an impact on your career"".   He rubbished suggestions that Mr Raab was being targeted in a politically motivated attack by civil service ""mandarins"" as allies of Mr Raab have suggested. Mr Penman said: ""That's extraordinary and it couldn't be further from the truth.  ""In actual fact I've spoken to people who didn't raise concerns at the time because they understood the political impact... ""Are we really seeing two dozen civil servants in three different Government departments over a period of four years have got together in some massive conspiracy? That just doesn't sound credible."" Asked why the civil servants waited years to come forward, Mr Penman said: ""Because it's really difficult to raise complaints."" Mr Sunak has tasked lawyer Adam Tolley KC with investigating bullying claims against Mr Raab, with dozens of civil servants believed to be involved in eight formal complaints.  Mr Penman called on Mr Sunak to say how much he knew about complaints concerning Mr Raab. Downing Street has only ruled out the Prime Minister being aware of ""formal complaints"" as reports suggested he had been warned about his ally's behaviour. Yesterday Mr Sunak came under attack at PMQs, with Labour leader Keir Starmer branding him ""weak"". This morning shadow Levelling Up Secretary Lisa Nandy told Sky News: ""If he can't stand up to people in his own cabinet, what hope is there for the British people."" And she added: ""The public is paying the price for this Tory psychodrama."" Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey also accused the PM of being weak for not suspending Mr Raab. He said: ""I do think in the meantime he (Dominic Raab) should be suspended because the allegations are so serious.  ""And again it goes to the weakness of the Prime Minister that he's not prepared to take action when faced with the facts. ""And one of the things we'd like to see is the independent advisor on ethical standards look into what the Prime Minister knew and when with respect to these allegations of bullying against Dominic Raab. ""Did he appoint Dominic Raab knowing these serious allegations were there?""  Yesterday the Prime Minister's press secretary said: ""The PM was not aware of any formal complaints at the time of appointing Dominic Raab."" Pressed further, she said: ""I don't know what your definition of informal complaints is. The PET (propriety and ethics team in the Cabinet Office) processes are very clear. ""The appointments and usual processes were followed and we were not aware of any formal complaints."" Earlier this week The Mirror reported witnesses also claim the Deputy PM would switch his anger on and off depending on whether it was civil ­servants or ministers in the room. Mr Raab's spokesman has ­previously said he “looks forward to answering the ­allegations made of him directly”. Mr Raab insisted last week: “I’m ­confident I behaved professionally, and of course the ­Government takes a ­zero-tolerance approach to bullying.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/union-boss-says-civil-servants-29111934
"Exhausted teachers vow to keep protesting 'until change happens' as 200,000 walk out","Exhausted and overworked teachers joined university staff, train drivers, civil servants, bus drivers and security guards in the biggest day of industrial action in more than a decade todayMore than 200,000 desperate teachers abandoned ­classrooms for picket lines to demand better for Britain’s children.  Nine in ten schools in England and Wales were hit by strikes, according to one poll today.   Teachers joined university staff, train drivers, civil servants, bus drivers and security guards in the biggest day of industrial action in more than a decade. They told the Mirror how they were exhausted, overworked and in an industry left “short-changed” by more than a decade of underfunding by the Tories.   They said: “We want change to happen and we are going to keep marching until it does.”   Leaders of the National Education Union, which is demanding above-inflation pay rises, accused education secretary Gillian Keegan of “letting this generation of children down”.   The NEU joint general secretaries Dr Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney said the disruption was “dwarfed by the long-term damage caused by government policy on education funding, on workload, and on pay.”  Four in five schools were partially open, while 9% were completely shut, a survey by the Association of School and College Leaders found.  The NEU said it was putting Keegan “on notice” to come to the negotiating table ahead of six more days of strikes planned this month and in March.   In Central London, ­thousands marched on Downing Street, chanting: “No ifs, no buts, no education cuts.”   Kit Wright, eight, joined his mum Alice, an early years teacher, because he “wanted to make a difference.”  He said: “Hopefully this march will make schools better for me and my friends and better for children in the future.”  Alice, 46, of Queens Park, North West London, said: “Kit sees how overworked I am – taking part in this march is a way we can both show our voice in a powerful way.”   Others told how they spend their own money on basic equipment such as paper, pencils and glue. Cuts to support staff were leaving pupils with special educational needs without vital help, teachers said.   Rhonda Albert, 37, who said 14 support staff had lost their jobs at her South London primary school, added: “Our workload is overwhelming.”   In Eastville, Bristol, Year Two teacher Noelle Dallas, 34, said she had told pupils, “the Government is taking money away from your education”.   Secondary school teacher David Moughton, 31, of Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, said: “I love this job. I want the future of education to be amazing and bright but unfortunately it’s just not being invested in.”   Teachers were given a 5% pay rise this year, but it came out of school budgets. David said: “You really feel undervalued, when we’re trying to make the world a better place.”  Joining strikes in Liverpool, Carla Carey, 48, a science teacher in Widnes, Cheshire, who was joined by her daughter Alana, 16, said: “There is not enough funding for the mental health of students – that increases the ­pressure on school funding and teachers.”   In Dorset, folk singer Billy Bragg, 65, performed at a picket line, saying: “You’re stood here with us and now you’ve stood in solidarity.”   Teachers at St Osmund’s school in Dorchester said they were “delighted” with his rendition of 1986 tune There Is Power in a Union. During Prime ­Minister’s Questions, Rishi Sunak attempted to pin the blame on Labour.  Keir Starmer hit back: “After 13 years in power, trying to blame the Labour Party for his failure to sort out the strikes, it’s rank pathetic.”   Speaking in Westminster, Trades Union Congress general secretary Paul Nowak said: “It really is now the responsibility of Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt to get round the table and make sure resources are available to fund decent pay in public services.”   Department for Education figures showed less than 10% of schools in England were fully closed, while 44.7% had restricted attendance.   Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said: “One school closure is too many.”  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/exhausted-teachers-vow-keep-protesting-29109705
Teachers could be forced to tell heads they plan to strike under reported change,"Ministers may soon decide to change the law to force teachers to let heads know about their intention to strike in advance, a government source has claimed, after the education secretary hit out at unionsTeachers may be forced to reveal their plans to strike under new plans being considered by ministers. A potential rule change could see more requirements placed upon striking staff in the aftermath of Wednesday's mass industrial action, which saw up to half a million workers walking out in bitter disputes over pay, jobs and conditions. It comes after education secretary Gillian Keegan revealed she was surprised to learn that teachers are not legally required to let heads know whether they planned to turn up on strike days. A government source quoted by the Daily Mail has suggested ministers may now choose to ""act"" and enshrine this in law, which they claim would give schools time to put contingency plans in place.    They said: ""It is ridiculous that unions are able to add to the disruption caused by refusing to provide the basic information needed to make contingency plans, ""If this is something that is going to become a regular tactic then we will have to act on it."" Teachers in England and Wales, members of the National Education Union (NEU), embarked on their first day of strikes yesterday as they warned they have ""concern"" about the future of education. A huge march of striking teachers and protesters was seen in central London, while other demonstrations were also seen across the country including Leeds, Cambridge, Liverpool, Nottingham and Cornwall.  It follows a dispute about the Government’s offer of a 5% pay rise for most teachers, which works out as a 5% cut due to inflation. On the morning of the strike action, Ms Keegan told LBC she had written to schools asking staff to give their heads notice, saying: ""I wrote to them and said, ‘If you are going to strike, please inform your head’, because it’s important that… (they try) to minimise the disruption as much as possible. ""They need to help them (headteachers) in that by being fair and letting them know if they’re going to be striking or not.""  She added that she felt it was ""unreasonable” for teachers not to notify their bosses about their intention to strike in advance, and that it was ""a surprise to some of us"" that it was not already required. Several days of rolling strikes by teachers and educational staff are currently set to run until the middle of next month, barring any resolution to the dispute. A national strike in England and Wales will take place on on March 15 and 16, with separate strike in Wales is scheduled for February 14 and more regional walkouts in England on February 28, March 1 and 2.

British Steel owner faces calls to halt 'unacceptable' plan to cut 800 jobs,"Scunthorpe's Tory MP triggered an emergency Commons debate after the company warned of potential redundancies as energy costs soar and pressure on the industry to slash emissions growsBritish Steel bosses were today urged to continue rescue talks with the Government amid plans to axe 800 hundred jobs. Business Minister Nusrat Ghani told MPs a ""generous package of support"" was under discussion with the manufacturing company, amid fears of redundancies at its plant at Scunthorpe, Lincs. Scunthorpe MP Holly Mumby-Croft said British Steel, owned by Chinese giant Jingye, should ""immediately reconsider"" the potential redundancies. ""Jingye sat down yesterday with the unions and talked about laying off 800 British Steel workers,” she said in an emergency Commons debate. ""I cannot and will not defend this decision which is unacceptable in every possible way for my constituents. ""This is not a way to behave, it sends entirely the wrong message and breaches the spirit of negotiations, which I believe are the result of a level of government focus on steel and its wider issues, including energy and carbon costs, that are genuinely encouraging for the industry.

  ""Hundreds of families in Scunthorpe are now worried sick wondering if and when they will lose their jobs."" Blasting the firm’s warning of job losses, Ms Ghani said: ""It is peculiar for this conversation to take place while we're in the middle of good negotiations and as negotiations involve substantial taxpayers' money. ""These are sensitive negotiations, (but) I don't think it is inappropriate for me to say, of course, Government would want some assurances and guarantees that are linked to jobs too."" She added: ""I would urge British Steel to continue discussions to help us secure its future in the UK.""  Jingye Group became the manufacturer's third owner in four years when it bought British Steel out of insolvency in 2020. But Jingye has warned it needs taxpayer funding to keep operating. A British Steel spokesman said: “Unfortunately, like many other businesses, we are reluctantly having to consider cost-cutting in light of the global recession and increased costs. “We have discussed this in preliminary talks with the trade unions in which we shared the challenges we face.  “We look forward to working closely with them to ensure a long-term safe and sustainable future for the company, thousands of employees and many more people in our supply chain.” Last month, 440 jobs at Liberty Steel were plunged into jeopardy.  Writing exclusively for mirror.co.uk, Liberty Steel’s chief transformation officer Jeff Kabel warned a “revolution” was needed to save an industry “on life support”.  The UK steel industry employs 34,500 staff directly and supports another 43,000 in supply chains.

Rishi Sunak blasted for Tory 'addiction to sleaze' and being 'too weak' over Dominic Raab,"In a heated PMQs exchange, the PM was branded ""pathetic"" and branded ""too weak"" to stand up to his deputy Dominic Raab, who faces multiple allegations of bullying Rishi Sunak has been told the Tory ""addiction to sleaze and scandal"" has ""done huge damage to this country"" - as he was branded ""too weak"" to deal with deputy Dominic Raab. The PM sat side-by-side with Mr Raab, who faces multiple accusations of bullying, as he faced tough questions amid calls to remove him. In a heated PMQs exchange, Keir Starmer cited The Mirror's story about the impact the deputy Prime Minister's alleged behaviour had on victims.  He told MPs that some of those affected were claimed to have felt suicidal, and asked the PM: ""How would he feel if one of his friends were forced to work for a bully because the man at the top was too weak to do anything about it?"" The PM was branded ""weak"" for his handling of complaints about Mr Raab, and for his slow response to Nadhim Zahawi's breaches of the ministerial code. Mr Sunak was also branded ""pathetic"" over his failure to prevent widespread strike action and told to ""put his foot down"" over the huge taxpayer bill for defending Boris Johnson in a Partygate probe.   In a scathing broadside, Mr Starmer fumed: ""After 13 years in power, trying to blame the Labour Party for his failure to sort out the strikes is rank pathetic.  ""The Tory Party's addiction to sleaze and scandal has done huge damage to this country and the cost to the public keeps adding up. ""We've got a justice system letting murderers walk the street, heart attack victims waiting hours for an ambulance, an economy that is shrinking quicker than his leadership, and even I couldn't quite believe it when I saw that his Government is expecting taxpayers to pay the legal fees for the member for Uxbridge (Boris Johnson) defending himself over his lockdown rule-breaking."" Last week it emerged that the cost of the former Prime Minister's legal defence had soared to an enormous £220,000. Addressing the cost of defending Mr Johnson over an allegation he misled Parliament, Labour leader Keir Starmer said: ""Surely even this Prime Minister can put his foot down and stand up to his old boss and say he made this mess, he can pick up the bill?"" The Prime Minister snapped back accusing the Labour leader of ""carping from the sidelines"" and ""failing to lead"", citing criticism by Labour MP Rosie Duffield who said being in the party ""had reminded her of being in an abusive relationship."". Mr Sunak claimed he acted swiftly and decisively after his ethics advisor Sir Laurie Magnus found former party chairman Mr Zahawi had committed multiple breaches of the ministerial code.   Mr Starmer pointed out that ""anyone picking up a newspaper in July last year"" would have been aware that Mr Zahawi's financial affairs were being investigated. The Labour boss said the PM has been slow to act, telling MPs: ""So in relation to his former chair, his defence is: nobody told me, I didn't know, I didn't ask any questions. Is the Prime Minister now also going to claim that he's the only person completely unaware of serious allegations of bullying against the Deputy Prime Minister before he appointed him?"" Mr Sunak replied: ""The honourable gentleman ask these questions about what was known and I followed due process, I appointed an independent adviser as soon as I was made aware of new information.""  The Prime Minister is under pressure to suspend his deputy, Mr Raab who is subject to an ongoing bullying investigation.  Downing Street declined to rule out suggestions Rishi Sunak had been warned informally about allegations surrounding Dominic Raab before appointing him as Deputy Prime Minister. The Prime Minister's press secretary repeatedly said that ""the PM was not aware of any formal complaints at the time of appointing Dominic Raab"" - even in response to questions about whether he'd known about informal complaints. Pressed further, she said: ""I don't know what your definition of informal complaints is. The PET (propriety and ethics team) processes are very clear. ""The appointments and usual processes were followed and we were not aware of any formal complaints.""  The Mirror revealed that civil servants claim they suffered breakdowns and felt suicidal over the Deputy PM's alleged conduct- with staff saying working the Tory felt like being in a “controlling and abusive relationship”.    Mr Raab is being investigated over eight complaints during his time at the Ministry of Justice, the Foreign Office and the former Brexit department, which are said to involve at least 24 staff. He denies accusations of bullying.  Phillip Rycroft, the former top official at the Department for Exiting the EU, confirmed he had given evidence to the probe led by top KC Adam Tolley. He told Times Radio: ""I'm pleased the investigation is happening. ""Clearly for everybody involved in this getting this sorted out is long overdue, but we'll have to wait and see what the investigator comes up with and ultimately the decision on the basis of that evidence is one for the Prime Minister."" Dave Penman, leader of the FDA union, which represents senior officials, said Mr Raab should be suspended to protect other members of staff while the investigation is conducted. ""Dominic Raab is now facing investigations around eight separate complaints involving what we understand is dozens of civil servants in three separate government departments over a period of four years,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""If that was any other employee, if that was a permanent secretary in the civil service, they would in all likelihood be suspended from their job while the investigation took place. ""That's not to prejudge the investigation, that's to say if there are serious allegations of bullying and extensive allegations like this, that one of the considerations is how do you protect employees from that sort of behaviour? ""And while it's being determined, you would normally suspend someone, given the seriousness and extent of those accusations.""

Arthur Labinjo-Hughes and Star Hobson killings spark grandparents care help plan,"In the wake of the shocking deaths of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes and Star Hobson, the government today unveils a £200million plan to fix children’s social careGrandparents could be given cash to help them look after vulnerable children under changes to be announced by ministers.  The government today unveils a £200million plan to fix children’s social care in the wake of the shocking deaths of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes and Star Hobson.  Ministers have drawn up proposals to better involve family members in cases where children are at risk. A £9million fund will improve support and training available for kinship carers. The Government will also commit to exploring the possibility of providing a new financial allowance for those who become involved in looking after a child. In the case of six-year-old Arthur, his grandmother revealed he begged to stay with her the last time she saw him before he was killed by his evil dad and stepmother in June 2020.   One-year-old Star was killed by her mum's bouncer girlfriend after suffering catastrophic abdominal injuries caused by blunt force trauma just three months later. Social services came under intense scrutiny in the wake of the tragic cases.  During a safeguarding review last year, MPs were told services “ignored” bruises on Arthur’s back, while an ""over reliance"" on agency social workers in some local authorities meant concerns over Star were missed.  Other commitments in the strategy include foster carers receiving an above-inflation increase in their allowance and a £30million investment in family finding, befriending and mentoring programmes. Up to 12 local areas will also receive over £45million to support families with challenges such as addiction, domestic abuse or mental health to help children stay with their parents where possible. But critics say the total £200million pot of funding, which is to be spread over the next two years, “falls far short of the amount needed”.  They pointed out that even prior to inflation, the Care Review recommended additional investment of at least £2.6billion over four years to better meet children’s needs. Around 400,000 children in England are in the social care system at any one time, according to official figures. Barnardo’s chief executive Lynn Perry MBE welcomed the Government’s proposals but said they were concerned the “funding pledged is too little to help address the current crisis in children’s social care”. Anne Longfield, chair of the Commission on Young Lives and former Children’s Commissioner for England, said she was glad to see the plan’s “recognition of the importance of boosting family support and kinship and foster care”. But she added: “However, its proposals are not yet ambitious enough to meet the enormous scale of the challenges facing the system, and the funding still falls well short of the long-term investment that is so desperately needed.”  Lib Dem spokeswoman for education Munira Wilson said the Government’s plan “ducks the big decisions and kicks them into the long grass”. Ms Wilson, who is pushing for a Kinship Care Bill to provide more support, said: “This response shows that Ministers have failed to grasp the scale of the crisis in children’s social care. “The Conservatives are letting down our most vulnerable children. Better training for kinship carers is welcome, but grandparents, relatives and friends must not be left in the lurch to look after children in crisis without proper financial support.” Minister for Children Claire Coutinho said: “Children in care deserve the same love and stability as everyone else. Yet we’ve seen from the two tragic murders of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes and Star Hobson that more needs to be done to protect our most vulnerable children. “Our wide-ranging reforms will put strong relationships at the heart of the care system. From supporting our brilliant foster carers, kinship carers and social workers to getting early help to families and improving children’s homes, we want every child to get the support and protection they need.”  Follow Mirror Politics on    Snapchat   ,    Tiktok   ,    Twitter   and    Facebook   .

"100,000 nurses and patients sign letter to Rishi Sunak calling for NHS wage rise","Nurses are planning to walk out next Monday and Tuesday at a bigger number of hospitals than previous action - with the NHS facing strikes everyday except Wednesday next weekSome 100,000 members of the public, nursing staff and patients have signed a letter urging the Prime Minister to raise nurses’ wages that was delivered to Downing Street this morning. The Royal College of Nursing, who organised the letter (which is printed in full at the end of this article), is warning Rishi Sunak on his 100th day in office that the NHS is “deteriorating rapidly” on his watch. In a major escalation, nurses are planning to walk out next Monday and Tuesday at a bigger number of hospitals than previous action. The NHS will see strikes take place everyday next week except for Wednesday with ambulance workers, nurses, physiotherapists and midwives in Wales to walk out. February 6 (Monday) marks the first time paramedics and nurses will down tools on the same day. The RCN said the NHS has far from improved during the Prime Minister’s first 100 days in the job.  Fresh analysis by the union today reveals over 10,000 more patients a month are regularly waiting more than 12 hours for treatment in A&E since Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister. Likewise, nearly 400 extra patients on average each day have been stuck in hospital, unable to access the care they need in the community, under Mr Sunak’s tenure. Nurse practitioner and RCN member Carmel O'Boyle said: “In the 100 days that Rishi Sunak has been Prime Minister, I’ve treated well over a thousand patients. I’ve done dressings, analysed X-rays, given injections and shots, fished glass and dirt out of wounds after a patient has had a fall, treated infections and managed medications. “I’ve dealt with aggressive patients, people having a mental health crisis and patients with complex learning disabilities who present challenging behaviour. I’ve devised countless diagnosis and treatment plans after a full examination of each patient. I’ve had to impart bad news, and sometimes happier news. ""That’s what I’ve done for the NHS and my patients in the last 100 days in a team that is always short-staffed – what has the Prime Minister done to solve the crisis we’re in?” RCN Director for England Patricia Marquis said: “Since he took office, the Prime Minister has failed to deliver on his promises to the NHS and is letting it deteriorate rapidly. “More people are waiting in A&E, more patients are stuck in hospitals unable to access the care at home they need, and bed occupancy rates remain at dangerous levels. People are also having to wait longer to access mental health services when demand has never been greater. “Patients are not dying because nurses are striking. Nurses are striking because patients are dying. “Our members have a mandate to take strike action for another 100 days – and the Prime Minister would do well to see these strikes for what they are: a warning of the need for swift action. “The Prime Minister is letting down the nation’s health, millions of patients, and ultimately the economy. An ill and untreated population cannot work and contribute to the economic recovery that everybody wants to see.”  The RCN’s full letter, signed by 100,000 members of the public, nurses and patients: Prime Minister, The NHS is the bedrock of modern Britain. And it is crumbling. Nursing staff make up more than half of the NHS workforce, and they are pushed beyond their limits. Care is not safe and the public pays the price. For the first time in our history, Royal College of Nursing members in every part of the UK are considering industrial strike action. Our patients are our priority – and we will advocate for them. Over six million people are waiting for care. Patients are stuck in the back of queuing ambulances. All because we do not have enough staff. This year is worse than ever. Our members told us about the last shift they worked – 8 in 10 said the care given to patients was compromised because there were not enough nursing staff on shift. Unfair pay is forcing too many to leave. Over 25,000 nurses left last year alone. Without nursing staff, there will be no NHS. Patients deserve better. They deserve safe and effective care. They deserve dignity. They should not have to fear in their lowest moments that their nurse won’t be there. On behalf of the nursing profession, I implore you to see sense. Protect nursing to protect the public. Nursing staff will always speak up for patients – when will you speak up for us, and the people we care for? Sincerely, Pat Cullen RCN General Secretary & Chief Executive ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/100000-nurses-patients-sign-letter-29110024
Dog attack Britain: Faces of the children killed in horror attacks in the UK since 2020,"Four-year-old Alice Stones became the latest child to die in a vicious dog attack on Tuesday, with at least four children killed by dogs in the UK since 2020At least five children have been killed by dogs in the past year in the UK with a 26% rise in dangerous dog attacks since the pandemic began in 2020. Four-year-old Alice Stones is the latest child to be mauled to death by a dog in an attack that shook the nation on Tuesday. The dog, whose breed has not been identified, was shot dead by police as families queuing at a nearby food bank were told to get inside the church amid fears for their safety. Lancashire Police confirmed it was the family's pet. A neighbour revealed they heard Alice’s mother screaming in the aftermath of the tragic incident before police arrived at the scene. Alice's grandfather, who lives nearby, described the tragedy as ""horrendous"" and said the family are trying to come to terms with it.   The tragic girl's death follows those of Daniel John Twigg, three, Lawson Bond, two, Bella-Rae Birch, 17 months, Kyra Leanne King, three months, and Jack Lis, 10, who all died in horrendous dog attacks in recent years. It is a striking contrast to the three child deaths recorded over a six-year period between 2013 and 2019, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Today the Mirror demands answers to the national complacency around dog attacks. Would there be the same inaction if the young victims were from wealthy families? Or, in modern Britain, are the lives of some children worth less protection than others? An investigation last autumn showed a 26 per cent rise in attacks by dangerous dogs since the pandemic began in 2020. The Mirror revealed nine fatal dog attacks against adults and children between January and October 2022 alone, making it the deadliest year on record. Prior to this, the total number of deadly dog attacks per year remained at five or under, ONS research shows. Previous data shows three deaths in 2013, four deaths in 2014, five deaths in 2015, four deaths in 2016, four deaths in 2017, zero deaths in 2018, two deaths in 2019, three deaths in 2020, and five deaths in 2021. In these cases, the cause of death was registered as ""bitten or struck by a dog."" It is estimated that there are now 12 million dogs in the UK, two million more than before lockdown. This amounts to around one dog for every five people. Calls have been made for a change in the law with the RSPCA warning of a ""tsunami of welfare and dog behaviour issues"" since lockdown. While the Metropolitan Police say legislation on dogs can be very complex and includes both criminal and civil offences, with legislation dating back to 1871. The Mirror has been campaigning for changes to the Dangerous Dogs Act in the wake of a string of fatalities, amid claims little is being done to stop them.  Labour MP for Caerphilly Wayne David last night backed our call.   He said: “There needs to be a rethink of the legislation. It is extremely worrying there’s yet another death.” Here, we look at the most recent dog fatal dog attacks on children in England and Wales. Alice Stones, age four  Four-year-old Alice Stones was mauled to death by a dog on Tuesday.  The toddler was at a property in Netherfield, Milton Keynes, when the canine pounced at around 5pm. A neighbour recalled hearing Alice's mother scream before police arrived and the child was pronounced dead. Another neighbour Rita Matthews, 36, said she would see the girl while walking her own daughter to school.  Mother-of-four Ms Matthews described the youngster as a ""happy little girl, very happy"". ""She would say, 'Bye, auntie', and I would say, 'Bye, little girl',"" she said. ""You know kids, playing around,"" she added. Another local said: “It’s an absolute tragedy. Alice was so sweet. She was an angel. ""I know the girl. It's so sad to hear that news. ""She was always holding her mummy's hand on the way back. ""It's so sad we're not going to see the girl again and I pray all the best to her mum to get her strength back."" The animal was humanely destroyed and an investigation into the tragedy is underway. Daniel John Twigg, age three Three-year-old Daniel John Twigg went into cardiac arrest and died after he was attacked by a Cane Corso on May 15, 2022. A heartbreaking inquest found that the tot suffered head and neck injuries after the dog attacked outside his home in Milnrow, Greater Manchester. He was rushed to hospital but was unable to be saved by medics.  Police later arrested a 48-year-old man under the Dangerous Dogs Act in connection with the incident and the dog was put down. After Daniel's death three separate women came forward claiming they were attacked in the same area. Lawson Bond, age two Two-year-old Lawson Bond died of serious injuries after a dog attack in Egdon on March 28, 2022. His family began to drive him to hospital but were told to stop at Worcester Woods Country Park on the advice of the ambulance service. The toddler was blue-lighted to Worcestershire Royal Hospital and transferred to Birmingham Children's Hospital where he died on March 30.  Three Rottweilers were destroyed.  Bella-Rae Birch, age 17 months Bella-Rae Birch was 17-months-old when she was killed by her family's new dog at their home in St Helens, Merseyside. A young paramedic and a neighbour tried helplessly to save Bella-Rae after she was savagely mauled by the pet on March 21, 2022. The neighbour had rushed over to help after hearing the baby's screams and found her devastated mother Treysharn Bates ""crying hysterically"" outside the house.  Police were called shortly before 4pm and the child was rushed to hospital where she died fro her injuries.  The dog was handed over to police and humanely destroyed. Kyra Leanne King, age three months Just two weeks earlier on March 6, Kyra Leanne King was killed at a dog walking spot in Woodhall Spa, Lincolnshire. She was pronounced dead at the scene having experienced horrific injuries to her neck and head, after a husky sled dog called Blizzard attacked her. Speaking at the time, locals claimed the animal’s owners regularly raced it and other huskies on converted ‘sleds’ after dark at the popular forest.  Kyra's mum and dad have both been charged with being the owner and/or in charge of a dog which was out of control causing injury resulting in death. Karen Alcock, 41, pleaded guilty while Vince King, 54, denies the charge. Alcock will be sentenced this year while King will stand trial in June. Jack Lis, age 10 Schoolboy Jack Lis, 10, was mauled to death by an American XL Bully while visiting a friend's home in November 2021. Police were forced to shoot dead the pet after arriving at the scene in Penyrheol in Caerphilly, Wales. His heartbroken mum Emma Whitfield said the dog, named Beast, attacked her son's face and neck. She said when a paramedic brought out a blanket suddenly she realised he wasn't going to make it.  But Emma added she tries to remember him going out earlier that day ""with his skateboard in his hands"" rather than the horror of his final moments The dog's owners Brandon Hayden and Amy Salter were later jailed. American Bullies are not a banned breed in the UK but have been responsible for a rising number of fatalities in recent months. Elon Jase Ellis-Joynes, age 12 days Little Elon Jase Ellis-Joynes was just 12 days old when he was savaged to death by a pet dog on September 13, 2020. The newborn suffered 40 puncture wounds after being brutally attacked by the Chow Chow Alsatian cross called Teddy which was ""dangerously out of control. Teddy was owned by the baby's dad Stephen Joynes, 36, who was jailed for four years following the tragedy. Sheffield Crown Court heard that the hellish incident took place at a family home shared by Joynes and his fiancée Abigail Ellis, 28, in Doncaster, Yorks.   Ms Ellis was charged alongside Joynes with the offence of being in charge of a dangerously out of control dog, causing injury resulting in death. She was due to stand trial, but charges against her were dropped after Joynes took full responsibility and admitted the charge. He pleaded guilty at the same court last December to a charge of being the owner of a dog which caused death when dangerously out of control. The RSPCA has long been calling for a total reform of dog control laws and the need for a different approach to keeping people safe and dog welfare protected.  Dr Samantha Gaines, from the charity's companion animals department, explained that any dog has the potential to bite, so effective legislation for all breeds is necessary. ""We want to see effective breed neutral legislation and enforcement which focuses on early intervention so that incidents can be prevented from occurring or escalating, but they must be evidence based and proportionate,"" she said. The animal expert extended the charity's condolences in the wake of the tragic death of Alice Stones. She added: “The recent dog attack in Milton Keynes is a deeply sad incident and our thoughts are with all those affected by this little girl’s tragic loss at what will be an unimaginably difficult time.  “Aggression in dogs is very complex and there are different reasons why a dog might bite such as an underlying medical condition or injury, or fear of certain situations or circumstances."" While the wider circumstances of the attack remain unknown, Dr Gaines maintained that the RSPCA would always provide the same advice when getting a dog. Dog owners to be are advised to make sure the animal has been bred responsibly so that they are less at risk from health and behavioural problems, she explained. They must also ensure the dog gets proper training and socialisation from an early age and that they are able to lead a happy life.

Football ownership set for revolutionary shake-up that will impact multi-million buyers,"The Conservative Government is preparing to formally announce its White Paper on football governance which will finally implement rules suggested by the fan-led reviewThe Government is finally ready to implement the rules suggested by a fan-led review into football ownership, with major changes set to revolutionise the way the sport is run.  The review of football governance, which was chaired by Conservative MP and former sports minister Tracey Crouch, was first released in November 2021. It called for an independent regulator for the game to ensure financial stability, while also making it harder for clubs to join breakaway leagues, like the disastrous European Super League.   The recommendations have taken over a year to be scrutinised by the Government, but are now set to shake up the way the sport is run. The historic announcement that an independent regulator is coming is understood to be coming next week, but The Sun claims to have seen a leaked version.   Headline changes  A ban on clubs being able to join breakaway leagues, with teams only able to compete in competitions approved by the regulator A annual tax paid by all teams to fund the independent regulator Money will be taken from the Premier League and spread out more evenly in the lower leagues, to try and prevent clubs going bust New tougher ownership rules which will replace the “fit and proper” test and scrutinise the source of wealth All clubs will need to reapply and gain a fresh licence Fans to be handed more power, with clubs consulting them on key decisions   HAVE YOUR SAY! What do you make of the proposed rule changes? Comment below. Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan wants the regulator in place for the 2024/25 season and is expected to formally unveil legislation on February 8. The move to announce the White Paper, which is a prelude to Government legislation, comes amid growing pressure from Labour and prominent voices in the game, like Gary Neville, to speed up the process. “It’s about time Gov published the long-awaited football white paper,” tweeted Lucy Powell MP, Labour’s Shadow Culture, Media and Sport Secretary. “More than a year after the Fan-Led Review, following the European Super League fiasco, and a number of clubs on the brink, it can’t come soon enough. Yet it still won’t be actual legislation for years to come.  “We have been consistently calling for a statutory football regulator, even when the Government got cold feet. That legislation is now likely to come is a testament to that collective effort over years, and notable campaigners not least Tracey Crouch.” The changes will not be universally popular, with many Premier League executives wary about increased governance. Aston Villa chief executive Christian Purslow has previously warned that care needed to be taken not to “kill the golden goose”. Nevertheless, a group of 10 MPs from Merseyside are calling for the fan-led review process to be sped up, and for clubs to join the Fair Game group, which campaigns for football to be run more sustainably.  The MPs wrote: “The fan-led review included recommendations which would reset the governance of football and, for the first time, integrate financial sustainability, good governance, equality standards and proper fan and community engagement into the national game, through the use of an independent regulator.  “We believe that these recommendations are vital to preserving our footballing institutions for generations to come. Clubs all over the country have been in crisis and here in the north west we have seen the impact of that at Bury, Macclesfield and Bolton. Our Premier League clubs are a symbol of pride for the city of Liverpool and the wider region, and are a major influence in the football world. Their support could be a game changer for a Fairer Game.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/football-ownership-rules-revolutionary-shakeup-29111725
'Parents support teachers strikes as kids deserve to be taught by people who feel valued',"Mirror columnist Eva Simpson on the teacher strikes, and that while they may be a pain for working parents organising childcare, they are a necessary one in order for these valued people to be adequately rewarded for the challenging job they performMy heart sank when I received the dreaded email from my son’s ­primary school informing parents it would be shut today because of the teachers’ strike. Children would, they said, be sent homework to do at home. Oh gosh, it was a return to the pain of homeschooling without PE from Joe Wicks to put a smile on our faces. The parents WhatsApp group – usually reserved for messages about missing jumpers and the weekly spelling list – sprang into life.  Parents who couldn’t work from home were panicking about childcare, those of us who could work from home worried about how we’d even be able to get any work done, and how we’d feed our kids’ insatiable demand for snacks.  But despite the major inconvenience, pretty much all of the parents were on the side of the teachers. Because as challenging as it is when schools are closed, we all appreciate the great work they do in classrooms across the country. Day one of lockdown had me calling for teachers to be paid more when I realised how much they had to contend with during the day. Teaching is a passion for many who do it for the love of the job, but that doesn’t mean they should be paid any less.  Yesterday was the first of seven strikes expected to go ahead in England and Wales affecting 23,400 schools. Around 85% of schools were due to be fully or partially closed. Educators joined thousands of other workers on the biggest walkout in a decade with up to 500,000 downing tools.  The decision to go on strike won’t have been taken lightly. Talks stalled on Monday with teachers who have been offered a 5% pay rise which works out as a 5% pay cut due to inflation. Children deserve to be taught by people who feel valued and motivated, not fed up, ground down and struggling to make ends meet. For their sake, all sides need to get back around the negotiating table and sort this mess out. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/parents-support-teachers-strikes-kids-29109058
"Give Ukraine western fighter jets to fight Russians, urges Boris Johnson","The former Prime Minister dismissed fears UK and US aircraft would prove complicated for Ukrainian pilots, pointing to the success of Polish airmen flying RAF planes in the Second World WarBoris Johnson tonight called for Ukraine to be given Western fighter jets - pointing to the success of Polish pilots flying RAF Spitfires in the Second World War. The former Prime Minister used an appearance at a Washington think tank to demand Kyiv be given warplanes to help repel Russian invaders. The White House and Downing Street have so far ruled out sending fighter jets to President Volodymyr Zelensky’s regime. But New York-born Mr Johnson told the Atlantic Council he did not believe claims the aircraft would be too complicated for Ukrainian pilots. “I have to say I take that argument with a bit of a pinch of salt,” he said “I’m lucky enough to represent the constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in the west of London where in the Second World War was based the famous 303 Squadron which was flown by Polish pilots. Read More
  “Never forget that the Poles in the Battle of Britain took out one seventh of the Nazi planes. “It didn’t take long for those Polish pilots to work out how to use a Hawker Hurricane or a Spitfire and I don’t think it would take the Ukrainians long to work out how to use F-16s or Typhoons or whatever we have to give them.” Mr Johnson said that “every time we come to a fork in the road and we are asked to make a choice about sending some new type of weaponry to Ukraine to help them, we begin by saying, ‘No’ and ‘This is an escalation, this is a provocation, we mustn’t do this’.” He added: “Experience teaches us that when it comes to it, we finally decide to let the Ukrainians have what they need to defend themselves.  “If that’s where we are going to end up, let’s do it now and let’s stop the delay and end this war as fast as possible, because that’s the humane thing to do.” He urged: “Give the Ukrainians the tools to finish the job. “The faster they win, the greater the savings in treasure and in lives.” The former Premier also dismissed fears Russia would launch a nuclear weapon if the conflict escalated by western allies sending more equipment to Kyiv. Mr Johnson said Kremlin tyrant Vladimir Putin “won’t use nuclear weapons because it would instantly extinguish the last flicker of Chinese support, it would lose him everyone of the world’s swing voters, he would terrify his own people if he did so who would live in dread of the consequences for them”.  Defence Secretary Ben Wallace tonight refused to rule out sending fighter planes. ""I've been involved with this for a pretty long time and I've learned two things - never rule anything in and never rule anything out,” he said. ""This is not a solid decision. For now, I don't think that's the right approach.” Giving evidence to the Commons Defence Select Committee, the head of the RAF, Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston said the PM and Mr Wallace had been “very clear on where we stand on fast jets at this stage”. But he added: ""These are things that, the course of the invasion - of the brutal invasion and Ukraine's heroic defence and how we have supported them - that has been an evolutionary process and I look to the future and we should be ready for any outcomes."" * Follow Mirror Politics on Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter and Facebook ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/give-ukraine-western-fighter-jets-29109284
Labour demands action amid claims probation staff 'pressured' to lower offenders' risk,"Labour has demanded an investigation after a whistleblower this week claimed probation officers are under “organisational pressure” to allocate lower risk ratings to offendersLabour has demanded an investigation into claims that probation staff are “pressured” into lowering the risk of dangerous offenders. It comes after a whistleblower this week claimed probation officers are under “organisational pressure” to allocate lower risk ratings to offenders. The anonymous source told Channel 4 News: “The more complex and riskier cases, the more resources allocated to it. “There is some organisational pressure to lower the risk rating because you can pass more cases on to a person if they are less resource heavy.” A murder is carried out every week by an offender on probation, according to Labour analysis of official figures. The party is now calling on Justice Secretary Dominic Raab to launch an independent investigation led by the Chief Inspector of Probation Justice Russell into the claims.   Shadow Justice Secretary Steve Reed said: “The Government stands accused of letting murderers and rapists loose on our streets without the necessary supervision. This is a clear threat to public safety causing great alarm given the high number of murders being committed by offenders on probation. “The Government must launch an investigation into these allegations urgently. If under this Conservative Government dangerous prisoners' risk levels are being downgraded on release, they are responsible for increasing danger to the public. “Labour is the party of law and order. We will get a grip of the failing probation service and end this outrageous practice that puts public safety at risk in the most alarming way imaginable.” A Ministry of Justice Spokesman said: “There is no pressure to lower risk ratings. Probation officers use clear frameworks and risk assessment tools alongside their professional judgement to assess and allocate cases.”  However last week Mr Russell said  he cannot guarantee the public is being properly protected  without urgent Government action to reverse cuts.  He was speaking after his report slammed failings that left a sex predator free to kill Zara Aleena. Keir Starmer told Rishi Sunak the probation service is ""on its knees"" after the report found probation staff missed a “catalogue of chances” to stop a man with a history of violence murdering the 35-year-old law graduate.   The Labour used last week’s Prime Minister’s Questions  to condemn failings in the probation service, which he said were as a result of ""a botched-then-reversed privatisation, after a decade of underinvestment"" by the Government.  He added: ""It's yet another vital public service on its knees after 13 years of Tory government."" Mr Starmer told the Prime Minister: ""I spoke to Zara's family this morning. It is hard to convey to this House the agony that they have been through. They say that the Government has blood on their hands over these failings. ""He's accepted the findings of the report, does he also accept what Zara's family say?"" Mr Sunak replied that his ""heart of course goes out to Zara's family"", adding that the Government had made moves to address staff shortages and other issues in the probation service. The Prime Minister said £155million was being invested into the probation service each year “so that we can deliver better supervision of offenders”. He added: ""If we do want to increase the safety of women and girls out on our streets then we need tough sentencing, and that is why this Government passed the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act, which he opposite and his party opposed."" But Mr Starmer blasted the Prime Minister for “boasting” about the “protection that he’s been putting in place for women”. He added: “I’m not going to take lectures from him about that.”  Follow Mirror Politics on    Snapchat   ,    Tiktok   ,    Twitter   and    Facebook   .

'The Dangerous Dogs Act is failing as Britain suffers another avoidable death',"The horrific death of four-year-old Alice Stones is just the latest evidence that the inadequate Dangerous Dogs Act is failing to protect people and stop attacksThe death of four-year-old Alice Stones should shock the nation. Alice was mauled to death by a dog in the garden of her family home. She is the second victim of a dog attack this year and the twelfth in the last 12 months. Once again a family is in mourning. Once again there are expressions of exasperation that more has not been done to prevent the loss of another innocent life. What is absent is any action to prevent these senseless and avoidable deaths. It is obvious the current laws are not adequate and the Dangerous Dogs Act needs overhauling. It is also obvious that it is far too easy to own, sell and breed dangerous dogs. Yet there is absolutely no political will to make these changes. Words of sympathy are not enough. Unless the Government acts then more lives will be lost.   Lesson for PM There was the biggest show of industrial action for decades yesterday as hundreds of thousands of teachers, civil servants and rail workers walked out. They did not want to take this step. They were forced to take strike action because this government fails to value the public sector and those who work in it. The pay of an average teacher has fallen by 13% in real terms since 2010.  But teachers did not just take to the streets because they cannot afford to make ends meet. They were protesting at the failure of the Government to recruit more staff and invest in the education our children deserve. If Rishi Sunak genuinely cared about education he would have funded the post-Covid catch-up programme in full, tackled the £11billion backlog in school repairs and made sure teachers were properly paid. Kids’ pay gap Children get less money for baby teeth than they used to from the tooth fairy. Is this conclusive evidence there is no magic money tree in this cost-of-living crisis?

British Gas debt collectors break into vulnerable people’s homes to force fit meters,"Energy companies like British Gas obtain court warrants which give them the legal right to enter a property and fit the pre-payment meter if customers haven't paid their billsBritish Gas debt collectors are breaking into vulnerable customers' homes to fit prepayment meters, it has been reported. Energy companies like British Gas obtain court warrants which give them the legal right to enter a property and fit the meter if customers haven't paid their bills.  This forces the customer to top up the meter if they want to receive gas supplies, and if they fail to do so they could have their heating cut off. Energy companies hire third part party debt collectors to execute the warrants and ""break into"" homes, even when customers are known to have ""extreme vulnerabilities"". This practice came to light after a reporter for The Times went undercover with debt-collecting contractor Arvato Financial Solutions and joined agents who force-fit the meters.  Have you been affected by this? Get in touch at webnews@mirror.co.uk   Some of the ""vulnerable"" customers the Times reporter came across included a single father with three young children and a mother with a four-week-old baby. Owner of British Gas, Centrica, announced it was suspending ""all warrant activity"" after the newspaper's article was published. The parent company will also launch an investigation into the claims. Centrica chief executive officer Chris O'Shea told the Mirror in a statement: ""Protecting vulnerable customers is an absolute priority and we have clear processes and policies to ensure we manage customer debt carefully and safely.  ""The allegations around our third-party contractor Arvato are unacceptable and we immediately suspended their warrant activity. ""Having recently reviewed our internal processes to support our prepayment customers as well as creating a new £10 million fund to support those prepayment customers who need help the most, I am extremely disappointed that this has occurred. ""As a result, on Wednesday morning, we took a further decision to suspend all our prepayment warrant activity at least until the end of the winter. ""More broadly, there are clearly significant challenges around affordability and unfortunately, we don't see that changing anytime soon. ""We need to strike a balance between managing spiralling bad debt and being aware that there are those who refuse to pay and those who cannot pay. We think Government, industry and the regulator need to come together to agree a long-term plan to address this and ultimately create an energy market that is sustainable."" Grant Shapps, the business and energy secretary, ordered an urgent meeting with British Gas, adding: “I am horrified by the findings of this investigation and would like to thank The Times for shining a light on these abhorrent practices.” Energy minister Graham Stuart will meet with British Gas this afternoon over revelations about the company forcing customers onto pre-payment meters. The Prime Minister's official spokesman described the newly-emerged about British Gas ""deeply shocking and concerning"". He said: ""Rightly British Gas has suspended this practice."" Number 10 said the meeting had been called in response to reports this morning about the company's conduct. Energy regulator Ofgem has announced it will launch an investigation. A spokesperson said: ""These are extremely serious allegations from The Times which we will investigate urgently with British Gas and we won't hesitate to take firm enforcement action. ""It is unacceptable for any supplier to impose forced installations on vulnerable customers struggling to pay their bills before all other options have been exhausted and without carrying out thorough checks to ensure it is safe and practicable to do so. ""We recently announced a major market-wide review investigating the rapid growth in prepayment meter installations and potential breaches of licences driving it. ""We are clear that suppliers must work hard to look after their customers at this time, especially those who are vulnerable, and the energy crisis must not be an excuse for unacceptable behaviour towards any customer - particularly those in vulnerable circumstances."" Gillian Cooper, Head of Energy Policy at Citizens Advice, said: “It’s truly shocking to see the extent of bad practices amongst some energy suppliers.  “Our frontline advisers know only too well the desperate situations so many struggling customers have found themselves in. Time and time again we have called for a ban on forced prepayment meter installations until new protections for customers are brought in. “Ofgem and the Government need to act now - serious reforms must be made before these suppliers can be trusted again.” Arvato Financial Solutions told the Times it acted “compliantly at all times in accordance with the regulatory requirements”. Arvato Financial Solutions has been contacted for comment. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/british-gas-debt-collectors-break-29111669
Keir Starmer brands Rishi Sunak 'pathetic' for attempt to blame on Labour for mass strikes,"The Labour leader Keir Starmer made the comment at Prime Minister's Questions as up to half a million people take part in strike action - the biggest industrial action the country has has seen in over a decade Keir Starmer has branded Rishi Sunak ""pathetic"" for attempting to blame Labour for mass strikes - after 13 years of Tory rule.  The remarks come as up to half a million people take part in strike action - the biggest industrial action the country has seen in over a decade. Members of seven trade unions walked out on Wednesday, affecting universities, trains, and dozens of Government departments. Teachers in England and Wales, who are members of the National Education Union (NEU), also embarked on their first day of strikes, disrupting thousands of schools. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Sunak highlighted Labour's decision to vote against draconian anti-strike laws on Monday. He added: ""He voted with Just Stop Oil to water down the Public Order Bill and what do the unions and Just Stop Oil have in common? They bankroll him and his party."" Read More
  He also accused the Labour leader of siding with ""extremist protestors and union bosses"" as he dodged questions over sleaze in the Tory ranks.  But Mr Starmer replied: ""After 13 years in power trying to blame the Labour Party for his failure to sort out the strikes, it's rank pathetic.""  As the exchange took place, the Trades Union Congress held a series of protests against the Government's plans for a new law on minimum service levels during days of industrial action. On Wednesday the General Secretary of the TUC Paul Nowak also warned the Prime Minister to expect a further wave of strikes as industrial disputes ""won't magically disappear"". Speaking in Westminster, he said: ""There isn't a single public sector worker who is taking industrial action today that wants to be on strike. ""They are losing pay, they are not being able to deliver the services they are proud to deliver to the public. ""But the responsibility for these strikes lies firmly with the Government. It's been months now and still the Government hasn't sat down and seriously talked about a real pay rise for our public sector workers.  ""It really is now the responsibility of Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt to get round the table and make sure the resources are available to fund decent pay in our public services.""  As well as the impact on inflation, the Government must consider the wider affordability for UK taxpayers of potential pay rises for public sector workers, No10 later said. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""I think it's important for the public to understand that when unions understandably want more pay for their members, the Government has to consider how those things are paid for, and across the board there are three main ways to do that, there are tax rises, there are borrowing and there are cuts. ""And it's those kind of considerations that a Government, a responsible Government, needs to consider."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmer-brands-rishi-sunak-29105440
Labour MP forced to apologise for branding Israeli government 'fascist' in Parliament,"Kim Johnson's remark was branded ""completely unacceptable"" by Keir Starmer's official spokesman, and she is expected to be spoken to by the party's chief whipA Labour MP has been forced to apologise after branding the Israeli government ""fascist"" in the House of Commons. Kim Johnson's remark was branded ""completely unacceptable"" by Keir Starmer's official spokesman, and she is expected to be spoken to by the party's chief whip. A fellow Labour MP said her colleague's comments were ""unacceptable and dangerous"". Ms Johnson later issued an apology, admitting her comment was ""particularly insensitive given the history of the state of Israel"". The MP, who has represented Liverpool Riverside since 2019, earlier told the Commons that since Benjamin Netanyahu's return as Prime Minister, there has been a rise in human rights violations against Palestinian civilians.  It has been branded an ""apartheid state"" by Amnesty International, the Commons heard during PMQs.   The Labour backbencher told MPs: ""Since the election of the fascist Israeli government in December last year, there has been an increase in human rights violations against Palestinian civilians, including children.""  She was met with jeers as she asked Rishi Sunak: ""Can the Prime Minister tell us how he is challenging what Amnesty and other human rights organisations are referring to as an apartheid state?""   Following PMQs, Mr Starmer's official spokesman told reporters: “Kim Johnson’s words were unacceptable.” He added that Ms Johnson should withdraw her remarks, and it is understood that Labour chief whip is expected to talk to her today A short time later she raised a point of order to say sorry. Ms Johnson said: ""I would like to apologise unreservedly for the intemperate language I used during PMQs. ""I was wrong to use the term 'fascist' in relation to the Israeli government and understand why this was particularly insensitive given the history of the state of Israel."" Mr Sunak earlier said he would ""strive for peace"" between Israel and Palestine. The PM told the House of Commons: ""It is important in this matter to remain calm and urge all sides to strive for peace, and that is very much what I will do as Prime Minister and in the conversations that I have had with the Israeli prime minister.""  Labour MP Margaret Hodge tweeted::”This language is unacceptable and dangerous. “With violence escalating in recent weeks, this careless remark only makes it harder to bridge the divide. “Not to mention a complete insult to Louise Ellman’s legacy.” Dame Louise Ellman was Ms Johnson's predecessor in the Merseyside seat and chaired Labour Friends of Israel until 2020. In a statement today Amnesty accuses the Israeli government of a series of deadly raids, including one on a refugee camp in Jenin that killed 10 on January 26. The following day seven Israeli civilians were killed in a revenge attack, the human rights group said in a statement. Amnesty has accused the Israeli government of stepping up ""collective punishment"" as a result of these killings. Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General, said in a statement today: “The devastating events of the past week have exposed yet again the deadly cost of the system of apartheid.  ""The international community’s failure to hold Israeli authorities to account for apartheid and other crimes has given them free rein to segregate, control and oppress Palestinians on a daily basis, and helps perpetuate deadly violence.  ""Apartheid is a crime against humanity, and it is frankly chilling to see the perpetrators evade justice year after year."" The Mirror has contacted Ms Johnson's office for comment.

UK hospital declares critical incident as A&E department 'full' amid 'immense pressure',"The Royal Albert Edward Infirmary was flooded by ""unprecedented attendances"" to its A&E department which left it full and the hospital struggling to cope with ""immense pressures"" A major UK hospital has declared a critical incident as its A&E department is completely “full” while it battles “immense pressure”.  The Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan made the shocking announcement this evening as the hospital struggles amid current challenges to the NHS.  The Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust warned that after “unprecedented attendances” the A&E department was “full”.  On top of this, “growing pressures” on services further worsened the situation. A critical incident means the hospital can take additional action to ensure safe services are maintained as it deals with these increasing pressures. The trust added that it was facing “ongoing challenges” in discharging patients who are now well enough to leave hospital - a long standing problem facing the NHS.   This puts a limit on the beds available for incoming patients who “are in desperate need of medical attention” the trust said. A statement from the trust read: ""Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is currently facing exceptionally high levels of occupancy, growing pressure on our services, and unprecedented attendances at our Emergency Department (A&E) at the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary, Wigan. ""We are also seeing ongoing challenges in discharging our patients who are well enough to leave hospital, which has a direct impact on the number of beds available for patients who are in desperate need of medical attention. ""As a result of this ongoing pressure, the Trust has escalated its position to a critical incident, which means WWL can take additional action to maintain safe services for our patients and tackle this increasing pressure.  ""The safety of our patients and our staff is always our top priority and we are working through who needs our help as quickly and as safely as we can.

The trust reminded people that A&E should not always be their first port of call when people require medical attention. It called for them to consider alternatives that might be “more appropriate”. On top of this, there has seemingly been a problem with patients ignoring the advice of some teams as it added: “If you are directed to alternative care facilities, please accept the advice of our teams, as this will be in your best interest, and they are prioritising patients who are in desperate need of medical attention.” The statement added: ""We have a strong focus on safely discharging patients who are ready to leave our hospitals to make sure we can free up capacity for those who urgently require a hospital stay. Please help your loved ones if they are staying in hospital during the time they’re receiving care, through the discharge process and post-discharge when they need support at home. ""Recovery at home is always the best option, and our discharge teams will continue to help patients and families to make sure the transition to home is safe.""

Remorseless Boris Johnson brands those who think he covered up Partygate 'out of their mind',"The former Prime Minister told close ally Nadine Dorries in an interview set to be screened on Friday that he hopes it is ""obvious"" to everyone that he thought he was following the rules, despite being hit with a fine by the Met PoliceRemorseless Boris Johnson has claimed anyone who believes he knowingly covered up illegal parties at No10 is ""out of their mind"". The shamed former Prime Minister, who was forced to quit after a rebellion by his own MPs, told close ally Nadine Dorries in a TV interview that he thought he was acting within the rules. Mr Johnson became the first Prime Minister in history to be sanctioned by police while in office after being fined for breaching Covid regulations, and he faces a probe by MPs into whether he misled Parliament. The millionaire backbencher - whose legal defence is set to cost the taxpayer an estimated £220,000 - is the first guest on Ms Dorries' show on TalkTV, which will screen on Friday. In a clip released today the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip said: ""As you know there’s a Parliamentary Committee looking into some aspects of this and I had better be respectful of them.   ""But I’ll just repeat what I've said before, and I hope it's obvious to everybody, that anybody who thinks I was knowingly going to parties that were breaking lockdown rules in No10, and then knowingly covering up parties that were illicit that other people were going to, that’s all strictly for the birds.  ""And if anybody thinks like that they’re out of their mind.”  The former PM also doubled down on his claim that Brexit sped up the UK's vaccine rollout - which has been disputed. He told Ms Dorries: ""Thank goodness that era is behind us but one thing people forget - now let’s pray it’s behind us - but one thing people forget, thinking about the vaccine rollout is there we’ve got the, I think the third anniversary of Brexit, coming up, or the third anniversary of the day when we actually came out of the EU.  ""You don’t hear it much these days, but it is absolutely the case, that had it not been for our ability to do our own regulation, had it not been for the fact that we’d come out of the European Medicines Agency, the MHRA, the medical health regulation agency, was now totally free to decide how fast to approve the vaccine - we wouldn't have been able to do that vaccine rollout so fast.""   Fact checking organisation Full Fact has previously rubbished this claim, saying that the UK always had the right to give temporary approval to an unlicensed medicinal product in crises such as a pandemic. Ms Dorries, who served as culture secretary between 2021 and last year, is Mr Johnson's most steadfast ally - this month claiming Tories should bring him back 'or die '. She has also described him as a ""political rock star"". She refused to turn on him after he became mired in a number of scandals, and repeatedly claimed he had been stabbed in the back as his party turned on him. In a bitter attack on current PM Rishi Sunak earlier this year, she said: ""With Rishi in No10, we are heading into the long, cold and brutal wasteland of thankless opposition"". As reported by The Mirror at the weekend, Ms Dorries has been slapped down by Westminster’s revolving door watchdog over her forthcoming TV show. Watchdog chair Lord Pickles was left fuming after she failed to seek advice from his body before taking the job. All former ministers are required to ask the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) before taking a new job within two years of leaving government.  By failing to do so, Ms Dorries apparently broke the ministerial code. In a letter to Ms Dorries on Friday night, Lord Pickles wrote: “The government's Business Appointment Rules that an application is required for all outside roles. “As such, failing to seek and await advice are clear before the role was announced or taken up in this case is a breach of the government’s Rules and the requirements set out in the ministerial code.” He added that her rule-breaking would be reported to the Cabinet Office.

Rishi Sunak must suspend Dominic Raab during bullying inquiry says union chief,"Deputy PM Dominic Raab is being investigated over eight complaints during his time at the Ministry of Justice, the Foreign Office and the former Brexit department, which are said to involve at least 24 staff. He denies accusations of bullying Rishi Sunak has been told to suspend Dominic Raab during an inquiry into bullying accusations during his time in three departments. The Mirror revealed that civil servants claim they suffered breakdowns and felt suicidal over the Deputy PM's alleged conduct- with staff saying working the Tory felt like being in a “controlling and abusive relationship”. Mr Raab is being investigated over eight complaints during his time at the Ministry of Justice, the Foreign Office and the former Brexit department, which are said to involve at least 24 staff. He denies accusations of bullying. Phillip Rycroft, the former top official at the Department for Exiting the EU, confirmed he had given evidence to the probe led by top KC Adam Tolley. He told Times Radio: ""I'm pleased the investigation is happening. ""Clearly for everybody involved in this getting this sorted out is long overdue, but we'll have to wait and see what the investigator comes up with and ultimately the decision on the basis of that evidence is one for the Prime Minister.""   Two other top mandarins - ex-Foreign Office chief Simon MacDonald and MOJ permanent secretary Antonia Romeo - have also been interviewed by the inquiry, according to The Guardian. Dave Penman, leader of the FDA union, which represents senior officials, said Mr Raab should be suspended to protect other members of staff while the investigation is conducted.  ""Dominic Raab is now facing investigations around eight separate complaints involving what we understand is dozens of civil servants in three separate government departments over a period of four years,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""If that was any other employee, if that was a permanent secretary in the civil service, they would in all likelihood be suspended from their job while the investigation took place. ""That's not to prejudge the investigation, that's to say if there are serious allegations of bullying and extensive allegations like this, that one of the considerations is how do you protect employees from that sort of behaviour?  ""And while it's being determined, you would normally suspend someone, given the seriousness and extent of those accusations."" Labour's Steve Reed said the reports of complaints against Mr Raab were ""hard to read"".  ""Nobody going into their place of work should be subject to bullying and intimidation like that,"" he told Sky News. ""The PM promised us when he came into Downing Street just a few months ago - integrity, professionalism and accountability. ""What did he know about these allegations against Dominic Raab?"" Mr Reed added: ""With this number of allegations, of this level of severity, the normal thing would be to suspend somebody while they are investigated and yet Dominic Raab remains in post."" He said Mr Sunak was ""too weak"" to act and criticised the PM's delay in sacking Nadhim Zahawi and his reappointment of Suella Braverman as Home Secretary after she admitted to breaching the ministerial code. But Education Secretary Gillian Keegan rejected calls for him to step aside while Mr Tolley carried out his work. She told Sky News: ""I personally think it is fair to let investigations continue. ""I think that is the fair process. I think it was Dom himself who instigated this investigation. That is ongoing. That will uncover all the facts. When you get the facts you discuss and take the action."" Ms Keegan said she doesn't feel uncomfortable sitting alongside someone accused of bullying. ""I sit round the Cabinet table and don't see that. I feel very comfortable with my colleagues around the Cabinet,"" she said. Mr Raab’s spokesman refused to comment on the latest allegations. He has ­previously said he “looks forward to answering the ­allegations made of him directly”.   Mr Raab insisted last week: “I’m ­confident I behaved professionally, and of course the ­Government takes a ­zero-tolerance approach to bullying.” Jacob Rees-Mogg provoked anger on Tuesday by suggesting officials are being “too snowflakey” about bullying claims.

Fears for 800 British Steel jobs amid siren warnings for industry's future,"Unions demanded answers from the firm as reports suggest staff posts could be at risk as the threats to the struggling sector continue to mount - raising concerns about its viabilityFears were growing today for hundreds of British Steel jobs as ministers came under mounting pressure to thrown the firm a lifeline. The Government is considering a multimillion-pound rescue package for the struggling business. But reports emerged today that 800 workers could be made redundant by the Chinese-owned company. Job losses would focus mainly on the plant in Lincolnshire, according to Sky News. British Steel refused to comment when asked about potential cuts. Community steelworkers' union national officer Alun Davies said: ""We are extremely concerned about the reports that British Steel is looking to cut hundreds of jobs. ""This move would represent a betrayal of their loyal workforce and their commitments to invest in the business.”  He added: ""Steelworkers played their part to protect our steel industry and are being failed by both the Government and British Steel who are abdicating their responsibilities to the workforce and our country. ""British Steel should urgently clarify its position and know that we will use any means at our disposal to fight this dangerous plan."" Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “This is deeply worrying news for British Steel workers and their families who need urgent clarity on the future of the site. “Endless sticking plasters from the Conservatives have left our UK steel sector on the brink. “Britain needs a long-term solution not just another bailout with no plan to keep UK steel internationally competitive or deliver a return on taxpayers’ investment.” The Government is reportedly considering cash injections into both British Steel and Tata Steel UK. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt was said to be close to signing off on a support package, which could funnel around £300million to British Steel, with an ""equivalent"" sum going to Tata. Ministers were said to have demanded the companies agree to protect jobs if they wanted the Government handout.  UK steel firms have repeatedly warned about the existential threat to the industry because of high energy costs. They have called for help in switching to more environmentally friendly production methods, amid pressure to slash emissions.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman said today: ""Any reports of prospective job losses would be of concern.” He insisted the Government “always stands ready to provide or signpost assistance for anyone who needs it”.  He added: ""In terms of long-term support for UK steel, this is a Government that has taken a number of steps in this space.""  Last month, 440 jobs at Liberty Steel were plunged into jeopardy.  Writing exclusively for  mirror.co.uk , Liberty Steel’s chief transformation officer Jeff Kabel warned a “revolution” was needed to save an industry “on life support”.  The UK steel industry employs 34,500 staff directly and supports another 43,000 in supply chains.

Ukraine confirms Putin planning February 'anniversary' attack with half a million troops,"Ukraine's defence minister has warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin has amassed half a million troops and could use them for an 'anniversary' attack on the countryUkraine has confirmed fears that Russian President Vladimir Putin may be planning a February 24 'anniversary' attack on the country with half a million troops. Ukraine’s defence minister Oleksii Reznikov has said that Moscow has amassed hundreds of thousands of troops and could “try something” on the one year anniversary of its invasion. The major new offensive would mark another phase of the ongoing war, and comes after prolonged fears Russia might utilise the anniversary date to renew their efforts to take Ukraine. The Kremlin shocked the world when, in February last year, it invaded the country and tried to seize Kyiv as apart of what it claimed was a ""special military operation"". Any attack would also mark Russia’s Defender of the Fatherland Day on February 23 - which celebrates the army.   Mr Reznikov said the Kremlin has gathered half a million troops for the potential offensive. In September last year, Putin announced a general mobilisation that bolstered his forces by an estimated 300,000 soldiers. But Mr Reznikov warned the true figure could be far higher than this. Speaking to the BFM Network in France, he said: ""Officially they announced 300,000 but when we see the troops at the borders, according to our assessments it is much more,"". This comes as NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned there had been no indication that Putin had been deterred from his goal of total conquest of Ukraine.  He said: ""That they are actively acquiring new weapons, more ammunition, ramping up their own production, but also acquiring more weapons from other authoritarian states like Iran and North Korea. ""And most of all, we have seen no sign that President Putin has changed his overall goal of this invasion - that is to control a neighbour, to control Ukraine. So as long as this is the case, we need to be prepared for the long haul."" The fighting itself has reached something of a stalemate in recent months despite heavy conflict in the Donbas region in the east of Ukraine. Neither side has made significant territorial advances apart from Russia's seizure of the town of Soledar.  But Mr Reznikov said Ukraine was hoping to ""stabilise the front and prepare for a counter offensive."" He added: ""I have faith that the year 2023 can be the year of military victory,"". The defence minister was in France to strike a deal to purchase more MG-200 air defence radars which Mr Reznikov said would ""significantly increase the capacity of the armed forces to detect air targets, including winged and ballistic missiles, and drones of various types"". Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar said that the infamous Wagner Group were supporting Russian forces in the intense fighting taking part in the Donbas region.  The Mirror recently revealed that the mercenary group were secretly developing ""swarm drones"" in a shadowy arms deal with Chinese spies. Putin's forces have been desperately trying to seize the town of Bakhmut, in the region, and Lyman, a former Russian logistics hub that Ukraine took back in October. On Telegram she wrote: ""Russian troops are actively trying to reach the borders of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Our soldiers defend every centimetre of Ukrainian land,"".

Out of touch Rishi Sunak doesn't regularly read newspapers or online news sites,"According to his press secretary, the Prime Minister only occasionally looks at the news online, and reading the newspapers is ""not something he does every morning""Out-of-touch Rishi Sunak doesn’t regularly read the newspapers, his press secretary has admitted. And he only “occasionally” looks at the news online.  The admission came amid mounting questions on what the Prime Minister knew about allegations around the behaviour of his deputy, Dominic Raab.  The PM’s press secretary said Mr Sunak was not “aware of any formal complaints” against Mr Raab over bullying claims when he made him Deputy PM and Justice Secretary. Asked if Mr Sunak was aware of informal complaints, allegations or reports about his behaviour, she repeated: “The Prime Minister was not aware of any formal complaints.” Given stories in the media about Mr Raab’s behaviour predated his appointment by Mr Sunak, the Press Secretary was asked if the PM read the newspapers. The Press Secretary replied: “I don't know how regularly he does.”   She added: “Obviously he does occasionally read news websites, but it's not something he does every morning with every newspaper."" The PM has repeatedly been accused of being out of touch with ordinary Brits. Appearing for the cameras to promote his disastrous Spring Statement, he was filmed apparently baffled while trying to use a contactless debit card to pay for petrol.  And he was snapped pumping the petrol he was paying for into a Kia Rio - which he had to borrow from a member of Sainsbury’s staff. In an interview the same day, he said the food item where he’d most notice a price increase was bread, because “we have all different breads in my house.”   The gaffe led to him being branded “Rishi Antoinette” on Twitter.  Photos ahead of his first budget in March 2020 saw him pose up with a £180 bluetooth coffee mug, which can be temperature controlled from an app on his phone. It’s been claimed the Chancellor’s favourite snack is a truffle-flavoured crisp made by Torres, which costs as much as £5 a bag from posh department store Fortnum and Mason’s. In pictures released before his 2021 budget in October, the Chancellor was shown wearing £95 designer flip flops made by LA brand Palm Angels and sold in Selfridge’s. And he revealed in 2020 that he starts the day with a ride on his £1,750 Peloton exercise bike, where he enjoys online classes hosted by Instagram-friendly New York trainer Cody Rigsby. And over Christmas the Prime Minister was widely mocked for asking a homeless man at a shelter he was visiting: ""Do you work in a business?""

Theresa May savages Tories over FIVE YEAR delay to Hillsborough report response,"The former Prime Minister commissioned Bishop James Jones to investigate the victims' families experiences - but five years on the Government is yet to issue its responseTheresa May today blasted the Government over a five-year delay in responding to a key report into the Hillsborough disaster. The former Prime Minister said it was “not good enough” for the Conservatives to still not have published their response to Bishop James Jones’ review of the victims’ families' experiences of the legal system. Grieving relatives were forced to fight for justice after a police cover-up of the disaster which unfolded on April 15, 1989 in the opening minutes of an FA Cup semi final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest in Sheffield. As Home Secretary, Mrs May commissioned Bishop James to write a report, which was published in November 2017. On Tuesday, the National Police Chiefs' Council and the College of Policing apologised for “profound failings"" which have ""continued to blight"" victims’ relatives as they published their responses to the study - piling pressure on the Government to reveal its own.

  Answering an urgent Commons question today, Home Office Minister Chris Philp insisted: ""The Government is fully committed to engaging with the Hillsborough families prior to the publication of the Government's formal response. ""I can also say that in particular since arriving in the Home Office two or three months ago, I have asked for this work to be sped up and we are expecting it to come out in the course of this spring."" But Mrs May, who was widely praised as PM and Home Secretary for her handling of the ongoing aftermath of the tragedy in which 97 Liverpool FC fans died, told Mr Philp: “Saying vaguely that the Government’s response will be available this spring, I do not think is good enough. “Five years on, the Government must publish its response.” She told MPs that while the police’s apology was welcomed, “frankly, it would have been far better for them to have done their job properly on that fateful April day 34 years ago”. She added: “If they had done so, families of the 97, and indeed the whole Liverpool community, would not have gone through the suffering and anguish that they have had to bear over the last 34 years.”  Labour MP Maria Eagle said it was “unconscionable” that 18 months after the last criminal trial into allegations arising from the tragedy collapsed, “there has still been no government response to the Bishop’s response”. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: “The Hillsborough families have fought for decades against obfuscation and lies to get to the truth and everyone hoped that Bishop James Jones’ report would be a turning point.” Ms Cooper also rapped Home Secretary Suella Braverman for swerving answering the urgent question. Mrs Braverman sat on the Government frontbench during Prime Minister’s Questions immediately before the Hillsborough debate - but left the chamber, leaving Mr Philp to answer for her. Ms Cooper said: “Previous home secretaries have shown the respect to the families and to the appalling ways in which they have been wronged by being here to respond. “It is a devastating failure of responsibility and respect to them not to be here.”  Labour MP Derek Twigg said: “It is an absolute disgrace that the Home Secretary was sat on those benches just before this debate started then left. “This was a disaster which has no parallel in terms of what happened and the injustice that took place.” A source close to Mrs Braverman said: “The Home Secretary stood up in the House the day before and expressed her sympathy for the families. “She also explained the Government’s position on its publication of a response to the Hillsborough report.” * Follow Mirror Politics on Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter and Facebook ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/theresa-savages-tories-over-five-29106300
Dominic Raab accused of bullying staff like 'abusive husband' with some 'left suicidal',"Witnesses allege Dominic Raab would set them lists of endless rules that were ­impossible to keep and then 'belittle, demean and humiliate' them when they failed to deliverCivil servants claim they suffered breakdowns and felt suicidal over Dominic Raab’s alleged bullying.  And staff insist working with the Tory felt like being in a “controlling and abusive relationship”.   Witnesses also claim the Deputy PM would switch his anger on and off depending on whether it was civil ­servants or ministers in the room.   Mr Raab is being probed over eight formal complaints involving at least 24 staff.  Witnesses allege he would set endless rules which were ­impossible to keep to and then “belittle, demean and humiliate” them when they failed to deliver.  It is claimed he would show “anger and rage” as he told staff “you are no good”.    A source said: “He would then be very different with ­everybody else. He changes his ­behaviour depending on whether you are a civil servant he has control over or another government minister.”  Some officials claimed they lost weight, had breakdowns or felt like ending their lives after feeling trapped.  Rishi Sunak has allowed Mr Raab to remain in post while the investigation into his behaviour is conducted by Adam Tolley KC. It is expected to take weeks or even months to conclude.   It centres on when he was Foreign Secretary, Brexit Secretary and his first stint as Justice Secretary.   In November 2020, a probe found then-Home Secretary Priti Patel had broken the ­ministerial code by bullying staff but Boris Johnson refused to sack her. Civil servants said they felt a ­“helplessness” after that decision.  Mr Raab’s spokesman last night refused to comment. He has ­previously said he “looks forward to answering the ­allegations made of him directly”.   Mr Raab insisted last week: “I’m ­confident I behaved professionally, and of course the ­Government takes a ­zero-tolerance approach to bullying.”   He was sacked as Justice ­Secretary and Deputy PM by Liz Truss when she took office in September. But he was ­reappointed to both roles after Mr Sunak became Prime Minister.  Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said: “These allegations make very ­difficult reading. Each new allegation against the Deputy Prime Minister begs yet more questions of Rishi Sunak’s judgment.”  Jacob Rees-Mogg today provoked fury by suggesting officials are being “too snowflakey” about bullying claims.   FDA union Dave Penman, who represents civil servants, said: “Even by his standards this is outrageous.  “Trivialising bullying that we know has ruined lives and careers.”   Mr Sunak will mark 100 days as PM tomorrow after promising to lead with “integrity, ­professionalism and ­accountability”. But he had to sack Nadhim Zahawi over his tax cover-up and lost Gavin Williamson as a minister over bullying claims.   If you’re struggling, the Samaritans free helpline is 116 123.

Six teachers open up on 'difficult' strike decision - and why they are doing it,"Antonia Lozano is one of the teachers going on strike this month. She says the main reason she voted for industrial action was how government cuts are affecting the children she teachesStriking teachers have said they are struggling to pay the bills as they join picket lines across the country in a battle for fair pay. Members from the National Education Union (NEU) have walked out today with 23,400 schools set to be affected. It has been left up to headteachers to decide if schools should remain open. ""Long hours and poor pay are the main reasons teachers are leaving the profession in their droves,"" the NEU said as some teachers have accused the government of ""taking advantage"" of their dedication. Emotional burnout, long hours and the stresses of the job have all been cited as reasons teachers have walked out today in search of better pay. Primary school teacher Antonia Lozano says she’s going on strike not just because of her own pay packet, but also to make sure children have the best education as they grow up.  The 30-year-old, who teaches year 6 pupils in Camberwell, north London, has worked in schools for eight years after starting out as a teaching assistant.   But as an experienced teacher she says she doesn’t feel her £40,000 wage reflects the work and responsibilities expected of her. Living in London, where she shares her rent with a housemate, she says little is left over at the end of the month.   Antonia, a member of the National Education Union (NEU) which has declared seven days of strikes over February and March, says: “I love my school and I’m really proud of where I work, but the pressure we are put under isn’t being reflected in our pay. The government wants us to meet difficult targets and deliver the curriculum, with the extra duty of care we have on top of that, but then are saying that our labour doesn’t deserve a pay rise.   “I think it’s important to live in the community I’m working in, so I live in Camberwell where rent increases as well as the prices of everything else has a massive impact on how far my money goes. Saving money is really difficult and buying my own home isn’t even something I think about, it’s completely unattainable to me.   “And I just look after myself. For many staff members who have families and other responsibilities money is an even bigger concern.”   But Antonia says the main reason she voted to strike was how government cuts are affecting the children she teaches. She says: “As someone who has worked in schools for eight years, I’ve seen such massive staff turnover which has had a huge impact on the children, but also on the adults who choose to remain in the profession.   “Something has got to change so teachers are more willing to stay in their jobs for long.   “It’s completely unnatural for us to leave children without a teacher for the day, but with the state of teaching as it is there are lots and lots of days pupils don’t have a teacher because of the high staff turnover.   “If parents want highly-skilled staff teaching their children, I believe this is a really important step we have to take.”  'Buying a house is not even an option' What primary school teacher Ellie Sharp hopes people will understand is that she is not taking the decision to strike lightly.  The 27-year-old from Croydon, South London, feels compelled to take industrial action today for two reasons; low pay and lack of funding in schools.   “Teacher recruitment is in absolute crisis, and part and parcel of that is workload and low pay. So our pay has absolutely gone down and down, in the last 10 years it has dropped by 20%. Even the 5% pay rise we’ve had this year doesn’t add up to the inflation rate. So we’re still essentially losing out on 7%,” she says.  “I always thought going into teaching would be the sort of job where I’d be able to save, and I’d buy a house somewhere, but that’s not even an option.”   This has played a factor in a third of teachers who qualified in the last decade having quit, and more teachers or assistants being spread thin or having to educate in subjects they know little about to the detriment of students.   “Also, the pay rise is not funded. and we’re seeing schools with absolutely crippling budgets,” says Ellie who teaches classes of 30 students. “I know that in my own school, we’re in a situation where teaching assistants aren’t going to be replaced.”   'Teachers are not respected or valued' Teacher Nicola Hawkins says striking is only way to get the Department for Education’ to listen about the state of the education system.   Ms Hawkins, who has been teaching for 25 years, said making the decision to strike was “difficult” but she is doing it to protect the future of schools and the quality of education.   The history lead from Cumbria said: “I have been a teacher for over 25 years and I am very much embedded in my local school and my community and I love my school.   “It is really difficult to make that decision to walk out, but I’ve come to the conclusion that it is in everyone’s long-term interests really.”    “We put evidence out to the School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB) every year and it’s been pointed out that recruitment targets aren’t being met, that teachers are leaving, but our pay has been whittled away over the last decade or so,” she said.   “Long term, what I really want for the kids in my school, and for every school really, is for students to be taught by people who are valued and who are paid their worth.   “And I think it sells those students short if they don’t have that.”   “We regularly plan and prepare resources and lessons, mark and grade work, we run after-school clubs, get ready early for breakfast clubs,” she said.   “We might have to do follow-up visits with families or put together special packages for increasing numbers of children.”   “I’m coming towards the end of my teaching career and I’m taking action not so much for myself, but for my colleagues and the future of our schools and the quality of education we can provide,” she added.   “We need people who are paid professionally, treated professionally and can compete with the rest of the world, and at the moment we are an outlier - teachers are not respected or valued and that is not good for children.”   'What I earn isn’t enough to pay my bill' Cara Dobbing said she used to manage on her £23,000 salary as a university student support staff, but since bills started going up she has had to take on extra work in evenings and at weekends to make ends meet.   The 32-year-old will be among the 70,000 University and College Union members who will walk out on Wednesday, and throughout February, in strikes which will hit 160 UK universities.   Cara, who lives on her own and privately rents a flat in Leicester, says: “The cost of living has really squeezed everything, and it’s got a lot worst the last six months.   “My gas and electricity has gone from £69 this time last year to £180 now, so the 3% pay increase they gave us in August didn’t help at all, it was a real terms pay cut, not a pay rise. We haven’t haven’t had a real pay rise for ten years.   “What I earn isn’t enough to pay my bills so I take on extra work as a Body Shop rep. I work 35 hours at the university and I’m not working an extra 20 hours on top of that to make ends meet, and then take a week off work every year to mark GCSE papers so I can afford to go on holiday.   “I don’t live near my family and I don’t see them as much now because I have to get trains, and fares are through the roof. I’ve cut back on the things we class as luxuries like takeaways, clothes and eating out, and I can’t even think about saving for the future.”   Cara says it’s not just about pay. “Our union did a survey and it found that on average people are doing 16 hours extra a week. The university made mass redundancies in summer 2021, and the university hasn’t recovered from it.     “People are starting early to get on top of emails, and staying late, but not get paid overrate, the uni is getting a lot of free labour out of us, it’s being run on free will.   “It’s really sad to see experienced staff leave because they just can’t carry on or they’re really stressed or get a better offer in the private sector.   Cara, who is a union rep, adds: “Being in dispute with our employer doesn’t feel great because you just think, what’s the point in staying? Should I find some something else? Should I try and get a job where I feel valued? But then you just think, if I don’t fight then who else is? Who else is going to stand up to them?   “The university sector has been so broken for so long, and it just seems to be getting worse. If no one stands up to them, then what’s going to be left? And what are students going to be dealt with in the future? And you think, well, if I have kids, and they want to go to university, what will it look like then?”   She adds that people should support the right to strike and oppose the new government legislation. “Before becoming a union rep I no idea how difficult it already is to get to the point of being able to take industrial action, the laws are already too restrictive, but it’s our only leverage.   “If this legislation goes through going to be really dangerous, it’s going to put all the power in the hand of the employer and leave us with nothing.”  'School will become a place of resentment' Phil Park is on strike today to sound the alarm for chronic underfunding in schools, which he believes will leave the education system in dire straits if not resolved.   The secondary school English teacher, 30, who is based in Burnley, Lancashire, explains “If it carries on the way it’s going, you’ll see a massive fall in terms of the quality of results. I think the chances and life opportunities for some of the pupils, in particular in state schools in more deprived areas will become less and less. School will become a place of resentment for many pupils, they won’t be happy, they won’t be supported and they won’t feel that they can achieve.”    Teachers' pay is down 7% with inflation, including the 5% rise given this year which was unfunded. Phil says, “The government’s refusal to fund the pay rise will incur various cuts across the board and this also could mean redundancies. It will definitely mean that pupils go with less in the way of materials and much money to be spent on them and developing the school life and developing our education.”   Aside from a lack of technological equipment for students to learn from, Phil also reveals that with many teachers leaving due to pay and workload concerns students who need extra assistance particularly struggle. “Teaching assistants’ time isn’t allocated as much to helping in the classroom, it is now being allocated elsewhere to various bureaucratic exercises,” he says. “Specific learning needs are being left until year nine or 10, before they are even diagnosed or identifiable… there isn’t enough staff to deal with the quantity of needs.”  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/six-teachers-open-up-difficult-29100218
Boris Johnson attacks Rishi Sunak's failure to send fighter jets to Ukraine,"The ex-Prime Minister used a surprise trip to the US to condemn Rishi Sunak's decision not to arm Kyiv with warplanes - only hours after Downing Street said the idea was 'not practical'Boris Johnson has told Rishi Sunak to ""forget about Putin"" and send fighter jets to Ukraine to help repel Russian invaders. The ex-Prime Minister used a surprise trip to the US to condemn his old Cabinet colleague's decision not to arm Kyiv with warplanes - only hours after Downing Street said the idea was ""not practical"". Asked about fighter jets, he told Fox News: ""Save time, save money, save lives. Give the Ukrainians what they need as fast as possible. Get this thing done. Forget about Putin."" He added: ""Every time we’ve said it would be a mistake to give such and such weaponry to Ukraine, we ended up doing it."" It marks Mr Johnson's latest intervention over the UK's support for Ukraine, which he regards as a key part of his legacy in Downing Street. The former PM made an unannounced visit to Ukraine last month where he met President Volodymyr Zelensky and visited Bucha and Borodyanka to the north of Kyiv, the scenes of some of the worst atrocities committed by Russian forces.   Mr Johnson struck up a friendship with President Zelensky while in office, and attracted accusations that he was using calls to Kyiv to distract from his political troubles. The scandal-hit Tory has found himself at the centre of a fresh storm after it emerged that his millionaire relative Sam Blyth had allegedly stepped in to act as a guarantor for up to £800,000 of credit to fund his lavish lifestyle in 2020. New York-born Mr Johnson is set to demand more equipment for Kyiv when he addresses the Washington-based Atlantic Council think tank later today. Downing Street rejected calls again on Wednesday to supply Ukraine with British fighter jets. Asked about the former prime minister's trip to the US, Rishi Sunak's official spokesman said: ""The Prime Minister welcomes all colleagues' backing for Ukraine and is pleased the former prime minister is continuing his staunch support of the United Kingdom's efforts to help Ukraine secure a lasting peace."" But he said that Mr Johnson is ""acting in his own capacity and not on behalf of the UK Government"". On Tuesday, Downing Street said training Volodymyr Zelensky's forces on Typhoons and F-35s would take too long, but it does not oppose allies sending their own jets. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told the Cabinet that the US estimates that 180,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured in the year-long invasion.  That is compared to around 15,000 killed during the decade-long war in Afghanistan. The Kremlin has also lost two-thirds of its tanks, Mr Wallace said, according to Downing Street's account of the meeting.  A national security official said Russian forces are suffering from equipment and munition shortages and have seen ""significant attrition among some of their most capable fighting forces and officer corps"". Other Western officials were more cautious in their casualty estimates, suggesting both sides have lost more than 100,000 killed and wounded - with the Russians sustaining a higher proportion of fatalities. ""The Russians have been attacking and that means they have suffered more fatalities than the Ukrainians have,"" one official said. The Prime Minister said his new strategy will be accompanied by ""greater diplomatic efforts and planning work"" with Ukraine ""on how to rebuild"" once the conflict is over. But it does not include sending the advanced fighter jets Kyiv is demanding, which No 10 said was not discussed at Cabinet. US President Joe Biden said on Monday he is not transferring warplanes to Kyiv despite the requests. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-attacks-rishi-sunaks-29102009
Where are teachers on strike? Search your nearest schools on interactive map,"Some 23,400 schools are expected to be affected by industrial action on Wednesday, when tens of thousands of teachers swap classrooms for picket lines amid fury over pay. See which schools are affected in your areaFed-up teachers are going on strike across England and Wales today as Tory ministers continue to resist their demands for decent pay rises. Members of the National Education Union (NEU) are taking part in the first of seven days of rolling strikes, which will run until March 16. Some 23,400 schools are expected to be affected when tens of thousands of teachers swap classrooms for picket lines to show their fury over more than a decade of squeezed pay. Teachers are joining university staff, train drivers and civil servants for the biggest day of mass walkouts in more than a decade. It coincides with a wave of protests by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) against the Government's anti-strike legislation, which passed the Commons on Monday night. Downing Street admitted that the mass strike action will be ""very difficult"" for the public after ministers failed to avert the walkouts.   In a message to parents ahead of the strike, NEU Joint General Secretary Kevin Courtney said: ""The strike will disrupt their child's education and we regret that, and it will disrupt their home life and their work life and we regret that. ""We sincerely regret it, but we're pointing to disruption that is happening every day in schools. If we don't persuade Government to invest in education that disruption just carries on."" Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said: “It is hugely disappointing the NEU is continuing with strike action. These strikes will have a significant impact on children’s education, especially following the disruption of the past two years, and are creating huge uncertainly for parents.  “With talks ongoing on a range of issues, including around future pay, workload, behaviour and recruitment and retention, it is clear that strikes are not being used as a last resort. “I have been clear today that unions do not need to strike to meet with me. I also reiterated my call to union leaders to ask their members to let head teachers know if they intend to strike, helping schools to minimise the impact on children.” STRIKE MAP WIDGET: Click on the strikes tab and enter your postcode below to see which schools near you are affected- or find a demonstration to show your support   Who is striking? Members of the National Education Union, the country's largest teaching union, are going on strike over pay. The NEU balloted more than 300,000 teachers and school staff in England and Wales for walkouts - and the union says another 38,000 people have joined their ranks since the ballot was announced. The union has not given an exact number of how many members will strike as there are seven dates in total and not all members will walk out at the same time. The NAHT, which represents headteachers, is planning to re-ballot its members after missing the turnout threshold required by law. The NASUWT also missed this threshold. When are the strike dates? Seven days of strikes have been announced, starting on February 1 and running until March 16. February 1 will be a national strike across England and Wales, as will March 15 and 16. In Wales there will be a separate strike on February 14. Regional walkouts will take place in England on February 28, March 1 and 2.  How many schools will be affected? The NEU says the first walkout on February 1 will affect 23,400 schools in England and Wales. There were nearly 26,000 schools in total according to figures from last year. Individual schools will only be affected by walkouts on up to four of the dates. Will children have to go in anyway? Children should go to class as normal unless they are told otherwise by their school. The Department for Education is urging schools to take ""all reasonable steps to keep the school open for as many pupils as possible"". But it is up to heads to decide whether they shut their doors or how to run the school day with reduced staffing. Schools are being told to prioritise vulnerable kids, the children of critical workers and those sitting exams if they have to restrict numbers of pupils in the classroom. Teachers should try to deliver remote learning if they have to restrict pupil attendance, according to the latest Government guidance.

"Teachers, civil servants and train drivers walk out TODAY in biggest strike in a decade","Today's walkouts by five unions will be biggest day of strike action since 2011 - and will coincide with mass protests by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) against the Government's anti-strike legislationTeachers, lecturers, civil servants and train drivers will go on strike today in the largest wave of industrial action in more than a decade. Up to half a million workers will down tools across England and Wales as ministers continue to resist their demands for a decent pay rise. Today's walkouts by five unions will be biggest day of strike action since 2011 - and will coincide with mass protests by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) against the Government's anti-strike legislation Soldiers are being drafted in to cover for striking workers as around 100,000 civil servant members of the PCS union are due to walk out - threatening turmoil at airports and disruption to services including benefits, passports, and driving licences. Downing Street said around 600 military personnel would be brought in to assist but admitted there would be ""significant disruption"". Tens of thousands of schools will be affected as fed-up teachers join pickets in protest over pay and workloads, which union leaders blame for persistent staffing issues.   Members of the National Education Union (NEU), the UK's largest teaching union, are taking part in the first of seven strike dates, which is expected to affect 23,400 schools in England and Wales. Six more days of walkouts have already been announced up to March 16, and the NEU has warned they could announce more dates if ministers don't get serious on pay. Some schools have already decided to close while other heads won't know what staffing gaps they have to fill until the strike begins. The NEU balloted more than 300,000 members - and another 40,000 people have joined the union since the strikes were announced. The exact number of teachers out on strike is not known, as schools will only be affected by up to four of the seven strike dates so not all NEU members will walk out at the same time.  There were 563,831 full time teachers in the UK in the 2021/22 academic year, the latest official data shows. In echoes of Covid lockdowns, schools are being urged to prioritise vulnerable kids and the children of critical workers, and then pupils preparing for exams. The Government has told heads to keep schools open wherever possible but they can switch to online lessons if they haven't got enough staff. Teachers are furious about the Government's offer of a 5% pay rise for most teachers - which works out as a 5% cut due to inflation. Talks to avert the strikes ended without agreement on Monday. Train drivers from the Aslef and RMT unions are striking today as part of a long running pay dispute in fresh misery for rail passengers. And lecturers and other university workers in the UCU union will also be on the picket lines.  Downing Street said today's mass strike action will be ""very difficult"" for Brits. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""We know that there will be significant disruption given the scale of the strike action that is taking place tomorrow and that will be very difficult for the public trying to go about their daily lives. ""We are upfront that this will disrupt people's lives and that's why we think negotiations rather than picket lines are the right approach.""  Fewer than 1 in 5 Brits (17%) think Rishi Sunak's Government is doing a good job negotiating with trade unions to prevent strikes - and 31% think a Labour government led by Keir Starmer would do a better job.  The poll by Ipsos, published today, found 44% back striking teachers while 35% oppose the walkouts. A majority of the public also support nurses (61%) and ambulance crews (55%) on strike action. Public opinion is more split on border force staff with 37% in favour and 34% against, while 35% back rail strikes and 39% oppose them. It comes as new analysis from the TUC said the average public sector was £203 a month worse off compared to 2010 once inflation has been taken into account. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak said: “Public sector workers face a double whammy. First ministers hold down their pay and then they attack their fundamental right to strike.  “Let’s be clear. This will do nothing to solve the staffing crisis in our schools and in the NHS.   “After years of brutal pay cuts, nurses, teachers and millions of other public servants have seen their living standards decimated – and are set to face more pay misery. “Instead of scheming up new ways to attack the right to strike, ministers should get pay rising across the economy – starting with a decent pay rise for workers across the public sector.” Liberal Democrat education spokesperson Munira Wilson said school closures were the last thing parents and children need after the disruption caused by the pandemic. She said: ""It’s unacceptable that Conservative Ministers have let it come to this. They have crashed the economy and bungled the negotiations over teachers’ pay. ""Today, parents and children will yet again be forced to pay the price for this Conservative chaos."" Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said the strikes were ""hugely disappointing"" and said unions didn't need to walk out to get her attention. She said: These strikes will have a significant impact on children’s education, especially following the disruption of the past two years, and are creating huge uncertainty for parents. “With talks ongoing on a range of issues, including around future pay, workload, behaviour and recruitment and retention, it is clear that strikes are not being used as a last resort.""

Half term holidays at risk as Border Force announce four days of strike action,"One thousand Border Force officers will stage strikes for four days during half term - putting school holidays in jeopardy - the Public and Commercial Services union has announcedOne thousand Border Force officers will stage strikes for four days during half term - putting school holidays in jeopardy. Staff working in Dover, Calais, Coquelles and Dunkirk are to walk out on February 17-20, the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union has announced. More than 100,000 civil servants who are members of the PCS union are to strike tomorrow. Border Force staff are affected by similar issues over pay, pensions, redundancy terms and job security. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: “Our members perform vital roles. We therefore expect our strikes tomorrow [Wednesday, February 1] will have a massive impact on public services. “And the strikes we have announced today in the Border Force will impact on people returning from their holidays during the half term period.   “For while the government brought untrained military personnel in to replace our highly-skilled and experienced officers in airports over Christmas, they won’t be able to do that in France. “The blame for these strikes lies firmly at the feet of ministers who are refusing to put any money on the table.” Strikes by up to half-a-million workers across the UK in bitter disputes over pay, jobs and conditions are set to take place this week.  Teachers, train drivers, civil servants, university lecturers, bus drivers and security guards from seven trade unions will walk out on Wednesday in what will be the biggest day of industrial action in over a decade.  Thousands of ambulance workers in Unison across five services in England will also strike on February 10 in the long-running dispute over pay and staffing, the union announced today. It puts further pressure on the Prime Minister, who is failing to get a grip on industrial action.  Unison's February 10 strike again involves ambulance workers in London, Yorkshire, the South West, North East and North West.  Unison's fresh date will mean strikes will now be happening across the NHS every day next week apart from Wednesday.  The GMB announced that more than 10,000 blue light workers in England will walk out on February 6 and 20, and March 6 and 20, in a fraught dispute over pay. The February 6 date coincides with further strike action by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England and Wales, marking the first time paramedics and nurses will down tools on the same day. Nurses will also strike the following day, along with midwives in Wales.  Follow Mirror Politics on    Snapchat   ,    Tiktok   ,    Twitter   and    Facebook.

Labour MP 'bombarded' with death and rape threats after speaking out about Andrew Tate,"Alex Davies-Jones said she received the abuse to her 'inbox and my office' - as she used a Commons debate on neighbourhood policing to thank her own police force for its supportA Labour MP has said she was ""bombarded"" with death and rape threats after speaking out against the misogynistic social media influencer Andrew Tate. Alex Davies-Jones said she received the abuse to her ""inbox and my office"". She used a Commons debate on neighbourhood policing to thank her own police force for its support. The MP for Pontypridd, in south Wales, said: ""I'd like to put on record my own thanks to... all of the local police in my south Wales area who have been an immense support to me in the recent weeks after I have spoken out about the horrendous abuse and behaviour of Andrew Tate online. ""As a result, my own inbox and my office have been bombarded with death threats, rape threats."" The MP said the police response had been ""brilliant"", but added ""sadly this isn't the case for everyone who experiences the same"".   Tate was arrested in Romania after being accused of human trafficking and being part of an organised crime gang. He is to remain in detention until late February after a judge granted a request to extend his detention by 30 days for a second time. Tate denies the allegations.  The former kickboxing world champion amassed millions of followers across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and TikTok for his hateful content.  He has used his social media platforms to boast about being “absolutely sexist” and “absolutely a misogynist”. Earlier this month Ms Davies-Jones called on the Prime Minister to help schools tackle Tate’s “radicalisation” of boys in Britain. At a session of Prime Minister's Questions, she said: “Teachers are now having to develop their own resources to re-educate boys who are being brainwashed online by his deeply toxic messaging.  “The PM has been too slow to recognise the damage this is causing. “What has he done, what is his Government doing, to tackle this misogyny, this incel culture and the radicalisation of young men in this country? “And will he commit to giving teachers the resources they need to address this problem head on?” Mr Sunak replied: “With regard to funding, we announced in the Autumn Statement £2billion of extra funding for our schools. “But I'm also proud that this Government has introduced the world-leading, world-first Online Safety Bill, which specifically improves protections for children and puts very strict obligations and penalties on tech companies for enforcing them.” But Ms Davies-Jones responded on Twitter later that day: “The Prime Minister had an opportunity to condemn this vile individual on the floor of the House.” She said that it was “shocking - and telling - that he didn't”.

Esso owners raked in record £44bn last year as drivers battled with soaring fuel prices,"US heavyweight Exxon Mobil’s massive haul was not only more than it has ever made before but a historic high for a Western oil companyThe owner of forecourt giant Esso raked in a record £44billion last year as drivers paid through the nose at the pumps. US heavyweight Exxon Mobil’s massive haul was not only more than it has ever made before but a historic high for a Western oil company. It is among five oil “super-majors” expected to announce a combined annual profit bonanza of £160billion. Yet the colossal sums come off the back of soaring wholesale oil and gas prices, fuelled by the misery of Russia’s brutal war in Ukraine. Recent figures from the AA also revealed that Esso had the second most expensive fuel prices in the UK. Data from mid-January showed Esso’s petrol averaged 150.15p a litre and diesel 172.79p a litre.   Only rival oil goliath BP, expected to reveal annual profits of around £22billion next year, cost more. Texas-based Exxon Mobil made £10.36billion in profits in the final three months of last year alone. Its annual tally equated to £5.1million profit an hour, £85,000 a minute or £1,417 a second. Even Exxon chief financial officer Kathryn Mikell admitted its profits, and the amount of cash it generated, were “up pretty significantly” in the past year.  The vast amount oil companies are making has sparked calls for more countries to levy windfall profit taxes on them. Exxon Mobil’s results risk triggering another confrontation with the White House. US President Joe Biden has accused oil companies of profiting from the war Russia waged on Ukraine, and has previously raised the possibility of a war profit tax on oil companies.

"UK and EU reach customs deal that could end Northern Ireland logjam, says report","Customs agreement is largely based on the Government’s proposals for a red and green lanes system – green for Great Britain and red for Ireland and rest of the EUThere could be a step towards a breakthrough in the dispute over the post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol after the UK and EU reached an agreement on customs, it has been reported. According to The Times, the EU has accepted a plan that would avoid routine checks on goods going into Northern Ireland. However, a Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) source has indicated that this is not necessarily the case. The FCDO suggested the report was full of speculation, saying officials were engaged in “intensive scoping talks” with Brussels and declining to pre-empt the discussions.  The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU in 2019 as a way to unlock the logjam over securing a Brexit withdrawal agreement.  READ MORE:   Designed as a means to keep the Irish land border free-flowing, it moved regulatory and customs checks on goods to the Irish Sea, creating economic barriers on trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The Times reported that the customs deal is largely based on the Government’s proposals for a red and green lanes system – with the green lane for goods from Great Britain which are staying in the region and the red lane to check and control products going on to the Republic of Ireland and the rest of the EU. There would be a separate arrangement to negotiate on exports of meat and live animals to Northern Ireland, with the UK agreeing to maintain EU veterinary standards on goods destined for the province. It has also been claimed that Brussels has made concessions of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), a key sticking point in UK-EU talks. For the first time, it recognised the ECJ could rule on Northern Ireland issues only if a case was referred by courts there.  In response, the FCDO said: “Our priority is protecting the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and preserving political stability in Northern Ireland and the UK internal market. “Any solution on the Protocol must address the range of issues on the ground in Northern Ireland. “We are currently engaging in intensive scoping talks with the EU to find solutions to these problems.”  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ’s spokesman on Monday (January 30) also suggested no deal had been struck and that “intensive scoping” was under way.   Both sides are keen to reach an agreement to break the impasse over the contentious trading arrangements before April’s landmark 25th anniversary of Northern Ireland’s historic Good Friday peace agreement. Many unionists in Northern Ireland are strongly opposed to arrangements they claim have weakened the region’s place within the union. The devolved powersharing institutions at Stormont collapsed last year after the DUP withdrew co-operation as part of its protest against the protocol.

Yvette Cooper tells Suella Braverman 'I don't know what you do' in blistering swipe,"The shadow Home Secretary urged her Tory counterpart to 'get out of the way and let somebody else do the job' as she lashed out over the government's crime failingsYvette Cooper has launched a blistering attack on Suella Braverman - telling MPs: ""I don't really know what she does.""  The shadow Home Secretary urged her Tory counterpart to ""get out of the way and let somebody else do the job"" as she lashed out over the government's crime failings. Ms Braverman sheepishly grinned as the Labour frontbencher said she ""doesn't get let out much"" and branded her ""the shadow of a Home Secretary"". Latest Home Office figures show that the overall charge rate for all types of crime stands at just 5.5% - while for rape it is just 1.6% and for criminal damage and arson it stands at a lowly 3.9%. A Labour motion criticising the Tory ""decimation"" of neighbourhood policing and calling for an increase in officers patrolling the streets was voted down. Ms Cooper told MPs in the Commons: ""It's good to see the Home Secretary here today because we don't see her that much and, if I'm honest, I don't really know what she does.""   She said that many duties that a Home Secretary would be expected to take responsibility for had been passed over to other cabinet members. ""The DLUHC Secretary (Michael Gove) has been put in charge of doing anti-social behaviour,"" Ms Cooper told the Commons. ""The Prime Minister has taken charge on small boats. The navy has been in charge of patrolling the Channel - it didn't work, did it? No."" She added that Mr Gove has taken on the Prevent review and running Homes for Ukraine, while Education Secretary Gillian Keegan and Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride were running legal migration police. Immigration minister Robert Jenrick is running asylum accomodation ""because when the Home Secretary was in charge she broke the law"", Ms Cooper continued, adding: ""The security minister (Tom Tugendhat) has taken over security policy because she can't be trusted not to leak.""  Continuing her scathing criticism Ms Cooper said: ""She's not charging criminals because that's got worse, in fact the number of prosecutions fell by 20% when the Home Secretary was the attorney general. She's not sorting out the Windrush scandal because she's cancelled all of that.  ""She's not doing work on police standards, tackling misogyny or racism or violence against women and girls because she thinks all of that is woke. ""All of that fuss about the sacking this week of the member for Stratford as the Tory party chair and minister without portfolio ( Nadhim Zahawi ), the real minister without portfolio is still in office. ""She doesn't get let out much, she doesn't even do TV or radio interviews, I don't think we've heard her in the morning for months or on a Sunday for months. ""Because she is the shadow of a home secretary. She is a shadow shadow home secretary, so why doesn't she just get out of the way and let somebody else do the job?"" The Home Secretary branded Ms Cooper's speech ""really worthy of an Oscar"", adding: ""I think she's strong on alarmism, strong on hysteria, a little weak on facts."" She went on: ""They're (Labour) on the side of the eco-zealots, in the pockets of the militants and they don't care about the law-abiding majority."" Ms Braverman said the government is ""on track"" to recruit 20,000 new police officers by the end of March. MPs rejected Labour's Opposition Day motion by 309 to 195 - a majority of 114. Labour's motion sought to condemn ministers for the ""destruction of neighbourhood policing"" and the ""collapse in charges and prosecutions across all types of crime"", and called on the Government to increase the number of police officers patrolling the streets across Wales and England. MPs approved a Government-backed amendment to Labour's motion, backing it 308 to one, majority 307. The Government amendment struck out most of Labour's condemnation of policing, replacing it with a message welcoming ministers' efforts to shore up police recruitment and to address serious crime.

"Thousands of kids across country living in damp, mouldy and infested homes, Sadiq Khan warns","According to an anlaysis by City Hall over 1.8million children were forced to living in poor quality homes in 2019-2020 - leading the London Mayor to call for emergency action from Government ministersLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan has warned that thousands of kids across the country are being forced to live in damp, mouldy, and infested homes. His comments come as bleak figures show over 1.8million children were forced to live in shoddy homes in 2019-2020, according to a City Hall analysis. The number living in 'non-decent' properties was the highest in the North West - 342,000 - while the figure stood at over 260,000 in the capital. Properties that fail the Government's decent homes definition can include hazardous conditions - such as damp or mould - have poor insulation, or lack modern facilities. The analysis of the latest available data from the English Housing Survey also includes over 233,000 children in both the West Midlands and Yorkshire and 213,000 in the South East. Mr Khan said it is ""disgraceful that so many children across the country are living in damp, mouldy and infested homes"".   Last year a coroner ruled two-year-old Awaab Ishak's died due to black mould in his Rochdale home that was ""unfit for human habitation"".  At the time Michael Gove, the Housing Secretary, vowed to ""name and shame"" those who fail to meet standards and said ""more powerful regulator"" will be able to issue ""unlimited fines"" to failing landlords.  But responding to the figures today, Mr Khan said Awaab's tragic death ""shows the real life consequences of unacceptably substandard housing"". He warned: ""There could be more tragedies like this just waiting to happen if we don’t see change and I’m calling on the Government to take urgent responsibility."" The London Mayor added: ""Following my lead in turning off the tap for underperforming social landlords is a step in the right direction, but we need to see emergency action from Ministers to deliver higher housing standards in the private and social rented sector, with more resources for councils to go after rogue landlords."" A Government spokesperson said: “Awaab Ishak’s death was a tragedy, which shone a light on the appalling conditions that can exist in the social housing sector and we must do all we can to ensure it never happens again.  “We have already taken tough action against failing landlords, such as blocking Rochdale Boroughwide Housing from receiving taxpayers’ money to build new homes until it can prove it is a responsible landlord.""  They added: ""We’ve also warned others that they will face similar consequences should they fail to meet the standards expected of all social landlords.  “Our Social Housing Regulation Bill will strengthen the powers of the Regulator of Social Housing to ensure tenants are listened to and their concerns dealt with quickly and fairly, with unlimited fines for failing landlords.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/thousands-kids-across-country-living-29093141

The February 6 date coincides with further strike action by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England and Wales, marking the first time paramedics and nurses will down tools on the same day. Nurses will also strike the following day, along with midwives in Wales. Read More
  Physiotherapists who are members of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy will strike next Thursday, February 9. Earlier this month, health unions decided against submitting joint evidence about the wage rise due in April to the NHS because of the ongoing dispute.  Health secretary Steve Barclay had promised unions he would speed up the pay review body process. However NHS pay review body chair Philippa Hird told MPs this morning that his department has still not put in its own evidence despite the deadline having been on January 11. When asked whether not receiving evidence from the Department of Health would impact the pay review process, she said: “I’m still expecting evidence from the Government. If it doesn’t come, we’ll cross that bridge when it comes to it.” Health and Social Care Committee chairman Steve Brine said he was ""astonished"" the Government has still not responded. He said it must be ""intolerable"" not to have heard from the Government after it “spent all the holiday season... standing behind the pay review body"".  Unison head of health Sara Gorton said: ""After promising everyone a quicker pay review body process, the secretary of state’s own department failed to get its evidence in on time earlier this month.  ""Ministers must stop fobbing the public off with promises of a better NHS, while not lifting a finger to solve the staffing emergency staring them in the face.  “The government must stop playing games. Rishi Sunak wants the public to believe ministers are doing all they can to resolve the dispute. They're not.  ""There are no pay talks, and the prime minister must stop trying to hoodwink the public. It's time for some honesty. Ministers are doing precisely nothing to end the dispute.  ""The government's tactics seem to be to dig in, wait months for the pay review body report and hope the dispute goes away. It won't. And in the meantime, staff will carry on quitting, and patients being let down.  ""There can be no health service without the staff to run it. Ministers must open proper talks to end the dispute and put in place the urgent retention plan needed to boost pay and staffing across the NHS.” The PM's spokesman said: ""Ongoing strike action is deeply concerning and will worry the public. We are putting in place significant mitigations, which have previously helped reduce some of the impact from these strikes. ""But first and foremost we would encourage unions to reconsider that approach and continue discussions."" Follow Mirror Politics on Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter and Facebook.

Ofgem boss DEFENDS forcing people onto pre-payment meters as 'some choose not to pay',"Facing MPs today, Jonathan Brearley branded the controversial step 'reasonable' - but was met by disbelief, with Labour's Darren Jones responding: 'I'd assume most people who aren't paying their bills, it's because they can't afford it.'The head of the UK's energy regulator has defended installing pre-payment meters against customers' will - claiming many can afford to pay their bills, but choose not to. Facing MPs today, Jonathan Brearley branded the controversial step ""reasonable"" - but was met by disbelief. It comes as experts revealed one in four households now spend more than a tenth of their income on energy bills with charities facing ""unprecedented"" demand. Mr Brearley told members of Parliament's Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee: ""There's something I'll say that may not be popular here, but there are a group of customers who can afford to pay their bills but choose not to. ""Everyone is agreed in these circumstances that a mandatory move to a pre-payment meter is a reasonable response to those families who can afford to pay.   ""The question is how you identify a vulnerable group of customers and protect against those who face a much more significant risk when you make that decision."" He admitted he was unable to confirm the percentage of those who had meters forcibly installed because they did not have the money to pay their bills. By law companies are allowed to forcibly install meters as a ""last resort"", but the government has called for suppliers to come clean on how many times they've done this. Ofgem has announced it will carry out an assessment into whether companies are acting properly, and Mr Brearley said: ""The balance is something we'll uncover in the review. What I can't do is say there are X per cent who can't afford their bills.""  He said bad debts had risen ""significantly"", and said this impacts on all customers. Labour's Darren Jones responded: ""I'd assume most people who aren't paying their bills, it's because they can't afford it."" He continued: ""I'm struggling with the idea that you'd allow forced installation of payment meters because there have been case studies of some people who can pay but don't.""  The cross party panel heard that around 12 million households - the equivalent of around 40% of customers - now spend more than a tenth of their income on energy bills. Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of Energy UK - which represents suppliers - said: ""Bills are still double what they were 18 months ago and we've got about 12 million households, which is about 40% of customers, spending more than 10% on energy. That's the previous definition of fuel poverty.  ""We need to look at targeted support but we also need to look at this as an affordability crisis across the piece and how that intersects with the wider cost of living."" She added that requests for additional support were up 300% compared to recent years.  Ms Pinchbeck said: ""That indicates we've got many more houses moving into what has been considered vulnerability previously at pace, and or households who are not indicating to us that they're vulnerable. ""I think from the suppliers there's an acceptance that more needs to be done in the vulnerability space, and we're working actively with the consumer groups and government to do that, but I would say that this is a much bigger problem than just prepayment meters or vulnerable customers."" It came after Citizens Advice estimated that 3.2 million people across Britain ran out of credit on their prepayment meter last year - the equivalent of one every 10 seconds - because they could not afford to top it up. Gillian Cooper, head of Energy Policy at Citizens Advice, told MPs: ""We saw a record rise in December of people who couldn't afford to top up their pre-payment meter, it was more than we'd seen in the previous 10 years combined. ""That to us suggests that the government's support package hasn't been enough to keep peoples' heating and lights on, and low income households are paying the price for a broken energy market here. Business Secretary Grant Shapps has demanded that energy suppliers stop forcing financially-stretched households to switch to prepayment meters.  Ms Pinchbeck told the committee that among a range of measures to strengthen protection for vulnerable and prepayment customers, Energy UK also wanted to see the Energy Price Guarantee fixed to £2,500 for the rest of the year. ""There's an underspend on that programme against what was budgeted because gas prices have fallen,"" she said. ""Were also calling, like the consumer groups, for some kind of targeted support in addition to that, so we're very up for conversations about things like social tariffs. And we've written to the Chancellor to call for the long-term picture on bills to be sorted by investing in green infrastructure but also in energy efficiency and doing some things on VAT to make things easier. ""We're doing lots behind the scenes and as much as we think that we can given the debt burden on the sector to try and help our customers without saying at all that if rules are being broken then that's excusable.""

Jacob Rees-Mogg blasted for 'snowflakey' claim about bullying complaints against ministers,"The top Tory mounted a desperate defence of Justice Secretary Dominic Raab who is being investigated over a string of bullying claims - which he denies - that reportedly involve at least 24 civil servantsJacob Rees-Mogg has been condemned for ""trivialising bullying"" by warning against being ""too snowflakey"" over complaints against Government ministers. The top Tory mounted a desperate defence of under-fire Justice Secretary Dominic Raab who is being investigated over a string of bullying claims - which he denies - that reportedly involve at least 24 civil servants. Rishi Sunak tasked lawyer Adam Tolley KC to launch a probe, which is looking at eight formal complaints during Mr Raab’s stints at the Ministry of Justice, the Foreign Office and the now-defunct Department for Exiting the EU. But the PM is facing calls to suspend him while the probe is ongoing, with even Tory MPs admitting the row is becoming a ""distraction"". The spotlight has shifted to Mr Raab, who also serves as Deputy PM, after Tory chairman Nadhim Zahawi was sacked over his tax affairs at the weekend.  There are also outstanding bullying complaints against ex-Education Secretary Sir Gavin Williamson, who was forced to quit in November after it emerged he'd sent expletive-filled texts to a colleague. Asked about allegations surrounding both Tories, Mr Rees-Mogg told Sky News: ""I think we've got to be slightly careful about the bullying allegations.   ""We mustn't be too snowflakey about it. People need to be able to say this job has not been done well enough and needs to be done better. ""It's a very difficult line to judge. It's not a straightforward issue in most cases.  ""It's how did somebody react, what did somebody say, is it reasonable to demand from senior and well-paid professionals a level of good service? And then you have to judge whether that line has been overstepped.  ""But I do worry we're getting a bit snowflakey about this."" Mr Rees-Mogg said it was ""completely sensibly"" for the Justice Secretary to remain in post while the investigation is ongoing. He also backed Boris Johnson for keeping Priti Patel on as Home Secretary despite her being found to have broken the ministerial code over bullying allegations. But Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union which represents senior officials, said: ""Even by Rees-Mogg's standards this is outrageous. ""A former leader of the House, trivialising bullying that we know has ruined lives and careers. ""Not only should he be ashamed of himself, but his leader and party should distance themselves from this."" Downing Street distanced itself from the remarks, with the PM's spokesman saying: ""I think you see the Prime Minister's views in the action he took."" The spokesman refused to comment on the Raab inquiry while it was ongoing. Mr Raab is facing calls to quit from his own party as jittery Tories fear the row is becoming a ""distraction"". “It just seems to me to be a repeat of the Nadhim Zahawi situation, where it is inevitable that he will be asked to leave the Government,” one ex-Cabinet minister told The Telegraph.  “So why prolong the pain? I think it would be right for Dominic to stand down.” Another added: “His position is becoming more and more difficult.  ""If the Prime Minister is to show his commitment to integrity, Dominic Raab should go while the case is being investigated. He is another distraction.” But No10 rejected claims it was a distraction, saying the PM was focused on his five priorities, which include small boats and the NHS crisis. Sir Simon McDonald, a former top civil servant in the Foreign Office, has reportedly given evidence to the inquiry. He told Times Radio last year that officials working for Mr Raab were “scared to go into his office”, and “felt demeaned” by his conduct. The Mirror previously revealed that Mr Raab has been nicknamed “The Incinerator” because he “burns through” staff so quickly. Liberal Democrat Chief Whip Wendy Chamberlain said the scale of the reported allegations raised questions for Mr Sunak. ""Why hasn’t the Prime Minister suspended Raab yet, for the duration of this inquiry,"" she demanded. “Rishi Sunak promised to govern with integrity but I’m afraid his track record so far is the opposite.  ""Scandal after scandal continues to emerge about various members of the Cabinet, yet Sunak is incapable of doing the right thing and taking decisive action."" Mr Raab has previously defended himself against allegations of bullying, saying: ""I've behaved professionally at all times… I look forward to dealing with it fully and transparently rather than dealing with anonymous comments in the media."" No10 has not set a timescale for the conclusion of the inquiry. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/jacob-rees-mogg-blasted-snowflakey-29092259
Warning that teacher strikes could last until SUMMER - all your questions answered,"Last-ditch talks with Education Secretary Gillian Keegan failed to break the deadlock on Monday, with union leaders saying the top Tory 'squandered' the chance to call off walkouts by refusing to get serious on payTeachers' strikes could run into the summer term if ministers refuse to budge over pay, the UK's largest education union has warned. National Education Union (NEU) bosses said they believe parents understand why teachers are preparing for walkouts and warned that strikes could run for months if the Government won't offer a decent pay rise for staff. Millions of pupils are expected to be impacted by the NEU's first day of strike action on Wednesday, which will affect more than 23,000 schools in England and Wales. Last-ditch talks with Education Secretary Gillian Keegan failed to break the deadlock on Monday, with union leaders saying the top Tory ""squandered"" the chance to call off walkouts by refusing to get serious on pay. It coincides with a major civil service strike, with around 100,000 officials expected to down tools - disrupting airports and public services including benefits, passports, and driving licences.   A further six dates of rolling strikes have already been announced by the NEU up to March 16 - and the threat of further walkouts looms in the summer. Joint NEU General Secretary Kevin Courtney told the Mirror: ""We really want to resolve this before we reach the end of term but if there is no movement from Government and if members are still ready for it which I think they will be, then it could go into the summer term too. ""We are really hoping that we can find a solution before we get to that summer term but we do think it's important that the Government understands it could go on longer."" Schools may be forced to close, merge classes or shift to online lessons during the walk out if they don't have enough staff to teach children safely. Mr Courtney said disruption caused by the NEU's first national walkout paled in comparison to the long term damage triggered by the staffing crisis in education. ""We're letting this generation of kids down and letting the future of the country down by not investing in our education,"" he said. He said the union would take any ""significant offer"" to their members over pay but added: ""Schools can't afford pay rises from their own resources so there would have to be new money."" Most teachers in England have been offered a 5% pay rise, which amounts to a 5% pay cut in real terms - on top of more than a decade of squeezed wages, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.  Underpaid and overworked teachers have won sympathy from parents, who see how they are struggling, Mr Courtney said. ""I really do think that we have quite a lot of parental support,"" he said. ""Our 338,000 teachers, they are all people who know how to talk to people. They have a connection with 10 million parents."" He added: ""If I was the Government, I'd be really worried that teachers can talk to parents about the problems in education."" Joint NEU chief Dr Mary Bousted said strikes were a ""last resort"" but the Tories have failed to grasp teachers' anger after years of cuts, squeezed pay and staffing shortages. ""It's a massive moment in the profession,"" she told the Mirror. ""Teachers are talking about their lives, talking about their inability to make ends meet, talking about how they just can't do it any more."" She said parents know that staffing shortages and the failure to retain experienced staff was harming kids' education. ""Parents will know that every day, what's happening in our schools is they are running on empty,"" she said. ""Their children are increasingly being taught by cover teachers, supply teachers, who do the best job they can but they cannot compensate for having a regular teacher who knows their child."" She added: ""This is a dispute that's been building over years. It's been a long term decline in teacher pay."" It comes as teaching unions expressed frustration after crisis talks with the Education Secretary yesterday(MON) amounted to nothing.  ASCL boss Geoff Barton said: “Parents will have been looking for the government to avert the planned strike on Wednesday. Instead, the government continues to talk around the issues rather than putting anything on the table which allows for any meaningful negotiation. It is deeply disappointing."" He added: ""The Education Secretary is clearly constrained in what she can do by wider government policy and by the Treasury even though there is overwhelming evidence that we have a full-blown teacher recruitment and retention crisis driven by the government’s erosion of teacher pay and conditions over the past decade."" Dr Patrick Roach, NASUWT General Secretary, said: “The Education Secretary cannot continue to procrastinate when there are sensible options that could be progressed in the interests of teachers, pupils and the government"" Ms Keegan said: “It is hugely disappointing the NEU is continuing with strike action. These strikes will have a significant impact on children’s education, especially following the disruption of the past two years, and are creating huge uncertainty for parents. “With talks ongoing on a range of issues, including around future pay, workload, behaviour and recruitment and retention, it is clear that strikes are not being used as a last resort. “I have been clear today that unions do not need to strike to meet with me. I also reiterated my call to union leaders to ask their members to let head teachers know if they intend to strike, helping schools to minimise the impact on children. “I will continue doing everything possible to protect children’s education.”  Who is striking? Members of the National Education Union, the country's largest teaching union, are going on strike over pay. The NEU balloted more than 300,000 teachers and school staff in England and Wales for walkouts - and the union says another 38,000 people have joined their ranks since the ballot was announced. The union has not given an exact number of how many members will strike as there are seven dates in total and not all members will walk out at the same time. The NAHT, which represents headteachers, is planning to re-ballot its members after missing the turnout threshold required by law. The NASUWT also missed this threshold. When are the strike dates?  Seven days of rolling strikes have been announced, starting on February 1 and running until March 16. February 1 will be a national strike across England and Wales, as will March 15 and 16. In Wales there will be a separate strike on February 14. Regional walkouts will take place in England on February 28, March 1 and 2.  How many schools will be affected?   The NEU says the first walkout on February 1 will affect 23,400 schools in England and Wales. Individual schools will only be affected by walkouts on up to four of the dates. Will children have to go in anyway?   Children should go to class as normal unless they are told otherwise by their school.   The Department for Education is urging schools to take ""all reasonable steps to keep the school open for as many pupils as possible"".   But it is up to heads to decide whether they shut their doors or how to run the school day with reduced staffing.   Schools are being told to prioritise vulnerable kids, the children of critical workers and those sitting exams if they have to restrict numbers of pupils in the classroom.  Will the Government organise extra teaching days?   There is no plan to do so at the moment. Schools should try to deliver remote learning if they have to restrict pupil attendance, according to the latest Government guidance.

UK economy to go BACKWARDS in 2023 with worst performance of all major nations,"The UK is set to see its economy contract 0.6% this year according to the International Monetary Fund which will be the worst performance of all the advanced nations Brits are set for more misery this year as the economy will slam into reverse and it will see the worst performance of all the advanced nations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned. In its latest World Economic Outlook update, the IMF downgraded its UK gross domestic product (GDP) forecast once again, predicting a contraction of 0.6% against the 0.3% growth pencilled in last October as Britain looks set to suffer more than most from soaring inflation and higher interest rates. But it nudged up its outlook for UK growth in 2024 to 0.9%, up from the 0.6% expansion previously forecast. The grim outlook for the year ahead puts the UK far behind its counterparts in the G7 group of advanced nations and the only country - across advanced and emerging economies - expected by the IMF to suffer a year of declining GDP. Among the other G7 nations, the IMF's 2023 GDP predictions show growth of 1.4% in the United States, 0.1% in Germany, 0.7% in France, 0.6% in Italy, 1.8% in Japan and 1.5% in Canada.   It comes against a backdrop of public sector strikes over pay and predictions that the UK is heading for a recession, with inflation still standing at more than 10%. The IMF said Britain's predicted GDP fall reflects ""tighter fiscal and monetary policies and financial conditions and still-high energy retail prices weighing on household budgets"". It follows efforts by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt last week to talk up the UK economy and its growth prospects in his first major speech in the post, declaring that ""declinism about Britain was wrong in the past and it is wrong today"". The IMF offered a chink of light in the otherwise gloomy economic update, predicting that the global slowdown will be shallower than first feared. It upgraded its global growth forecast, to 2.9% in 2023 from the 2.7% predicted in October as it said the reopening of China after strict Covid restrictions has ""paved the way for a faster-than-expected recovery"".   The IMF also said it believes global inflation has passed its peak and will fall from 8.8% last year to 6.6% in 2023 and 4.3% in 2024 as interest rate hikes by central banks begin to cool demand and slow price rises. But it warned that, in the UK and Europe, surging prices and the impact of action taken to rein in inflation, will continue to weigh on the economy. It said: ""Consumer confidence and business sentiment have worsened. ""With inflation at about 10% or above in several euro area countries and the United Kingdom, household budgets remain stretched. ""The accelerated pace of rate increases by the Bank of England and the European Central Bank is tightening financial conditions and cooling demand in the housing sector and beyond."" Mr Hunt said: ""The Governor of the Bank of England recently said that any UK recession this year is likely to be shallower than previously predicted, however these figures confirm we are not immune to the pressures hitting nearly all advanced economies. ""Short-term challenges should not obscure our long-term prospects - the UK outperformed many forecasts last year, and if we stick to our plan to halve inflation, the UK is still predicted to grow faster than Germany and Japan over the coming years.""

Kate Garraway blinks back tears as she confronts Matt Hancock over Derek's health battle,"MP Matt Hancock appeared in the ITV studio alongside Kate as well as hosts Susanna Reid and Richard Madeley on Tuesday morningKate Garraway grilled Matt Hancock on entering the I'm A Celebrity jungle as she lifted the lid on the reaction from those whose families had been impacted by coronavirus.   The Tory MP and former Health Secretary appeared in the ITV studio alongside Kate as well as hosts Susanna Reid and Richard Madeley on Tuesday morning. The interview came just days after Hancock's eye-watering  I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! fee was finally revealed. The MP appeared on TV screens for 30 days alongside the likes of Mike Tindall, Owen Warner and Queen of the Jungle, Jill Scott and earned £320,000. Documents published by the Houses of Commons state that Hancock received an eye-watering amount from Lifted Entertainment, ITV, with the fee being registered on January 11, 2023.   Later in the interview, Kate was invited onto the panel to give her perspective on Hancock’s explanation for breaking lockdown rules, as she cares for husband Derek Draper, one of the Brits worst affected by coronavirus. Derek has been severely unwell since contracting Covid-19 in March 2020, which the GMB presenter has documented in two award-winning ITV documentaries. She noted that when it was announced he would be flying to Australia to enter the 2023 jungle as the ITV2 reality show returned Down Under, people 'immediately' contacted her. She continued: “When you talk about the moment you fell in love and you were caught falling in love and whether it was guidelines or legal. “The problem is that because you were Health Secretary and because at that time I couldn’t visit Derek in hospital, he couldn’t see his kids, thousands of others couldn’t go and see the people they love because they were following the guidelines.   “It was all very muddled for us out here in the world.”  Derek's most recent health scare saw him returned to hospital in October, after he contracted sepsis. As Hancock sat across the panel nodding, Kate told the Tory that he gives the impression he doesn’t understand why there is such fury directed at him.  “She said: “You still don’t get why people are upset. That amount of money is vast to everybody.  “I’m sure there are many others that went into the jungle when you did and maybe got more or maybe got less.   “But they’re holding you to more account because you’re probably only there because you were Health Secretary, making those decisions.  “You made the decision to go in before you’d answered to an inquiry, at a time when people still feel very raw. I’m not sure people feel comfortable about why you did it.” Hancock replied: “The reason it’s important that I wrote the book in particular is I have to be completely open about what I did, why I took the decisions I did, so we can learn as much as possible. I feel really strongly about that.”  “If I can contribute anything now to the future of making sure this doesn't happen again, because there will be another one [pandemic] … “I do not blame the care workers at all. It's a really important point. I didn't want to demoralise care workers at the time. These are all important lessons for the inquiry.”  When asked if it's too soon to seek forgiveness from the public, Hancock said: “I think it's natural to seek forgiveness and I think that’s hard for people, and I understand that."" Despite initial backlash after entering the ITV programme, Hancock managed to sail through to the final and came third on the show after completing several Bushtucker Trials. Mr Hancock reached the final in December - finishing third behind soap star Owen Warner and Queen of the Jungle Jill Scott.  Speaking more on his time in the jungle on GMB, he said: “I knew they [the public] were going to vote for me over and over again and then they stopped voting for me to go on the trials, and they voted for me to stay in. “I’ve had more votes on I’m A Celebrity… than I ever got as a politician in Parliament."" Upon returning home to England, the MP for West Suffolk – who lost the Conservative whip after he agreed to appear on the ITV series - went on to announce that he will not be standing for re-election as an MP in the next general election.  Lastly, Hancock was questioned about his future as a public figure and whether he would like to become a host of Good Morning Britain. He said: “One thing I’d like to do more of is documentaries. I’m not planning on doing anything like that [I’m A Celebrity…] again, that I haven't already been involved with. “I have been a politician and I am clearly still in the public eye. I’m going to spend 2023 working out what I want to do… [but] no, I'm not going to be applying for your [Richard] job.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/kate-garraway-blinks-back-tears-29092029
Jacob Rees-Mogg warns of potential legal challenges as Strikes Bill clears the Commons,"The North East Somerset MP backs the Bill, but criticises clause 3, which is aimed at giving the Business Secretary powers to define minimum service levelsJacob Rees-Mogg has warned that the Government’s new strikes law will be subject to legal challenges unless it is drastically amended, as the Bill cleared the Commons.  The Tory former business secretary gave his backing to the Strikes (Minimum Services Levels) Bill, but said it was “badly written” and criticised the sweeping powers it gives to his successor Grant Shapps.  Rees-Mogg urged ministers to allow the House of Lords to amend the Bill to add detail to it, claiming this would mean it was “much less susceptible to judicial review”. The Bill cleared the Commons in a late-night Monday sitting, with MPs voting 315 to 246, majority 69. The controversial proposals aim to ensure there are minimum working standards during strike days across six sectors, including health and transport.   Rees-Mogg told the Commons: “I am a supporter of this Bill, I think this is a good Bill and a proportionate Bill, but it is a badly written Bill.” The North East Somerset MP criticised clause 3 in particular, aimed at giving the Business Secretary powers to define minimum service levels at a later date. Rees-Mogg told MPs: “I hope their lordships will look at this clause and say that is simply not something we can pass into law as it is currently phrased, that the Government must accept amendments, and I hope their lordships will vote through amendments that clarify and set out in detail the powers that are desired. “This is where the Government’s interest – the executive’s interest – and the legislature’s interest combine, because if this House passes good, well-constructed legislation, it is much less susceptible to judicial review. “That is why the Government should be keen that the House of Lords – in the time available, with the help, I would hope, of parliamentary counsel – will be able to specify the powers more closely.”  Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner branded the Bill the “Conservative sacking nurses Bill” and said Labour would repeal it if the party was elected to power.  She added: “It threatens key workers with the sack during a workers shortage and crisis, mounts an outright assault on the fundamental freedom of working people, while doing absolutely nothing to resolve the crisis at hand. “Let’s look at what this is really all about: a Government that is playing politics with key workers’ lives because they can’t stomach negotiation, a Government that is lashing out at working people instead of dealing with its 13 years of failure, and a Government and Prime Minister dangerously out of his depth and running scared of scrutiny. “We on these benches will vote against this shoddy, unworkable Bill.” Business Secretary Shapps claimed the Bill was “simply proposing to protect people’s lives and to protect people’s livelihoods”. In a short speech at the end of the debate, he added: “We move this debate this evening and this third reading because we care about people in our workforce, because we care about their livelihoods and because we care about our constituents and their ability to access vital services.”  MPs from Wales and Scotland sought to exclude the devolved nations from the Bill’s remit.  Labour MP for the Cynon Valley, Beth Winter, urged MPs to support her attempts to prevent the Bill from applying to Wales, while SNP MP Alan Brown tabled an amendment aimed at making it “clear that these Henry VIII powers should not and do not extend to devolved legislation”.  An SNP-backed amendment aiming to make sure the Bill would not come into force without the consent of the Welsh and Scottish parliaments was rejected by 321 to 46, majority 275. The Bill will undergo further scrutiny in the House of Lords at a later date. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/jacob-rees-mogg-warns-potential-29091607
Hillsborough disaster: Police chiefs apologise for EVERY force in country for 97 deaths,"Police chief Martin Hewitt has apologised on behalf of the police service for failing to keep people safe at the FA Cup match at Hillsborough, in which 97 Liverpool fans diedPolice chiefs apologised today in response to a damning report on the Hillsborough disaster. The Rt Rev James Jones, a former bishop of Liverpool, set out 25 recommendations following the deaths of ninety-seven football fans as a result of a crush at a match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on April 15 1989. Martin Hewitt, Chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, said: ""I want to make an apology on behalf of the leadership of the police service. ""Our number one job as police officers is to keep people safe and in April 1989 at Hillsborough we failed to do that. "" I am deeply sorry for the tragic loss of life and for the pain and the suffering that the families of the 97 victims experienced on that day and in the many years that have followed. That hurt and pain, can of course, not be undone.""   An inquest jury found the crush was caused by police failures in managing the crowd on the day of the tragedy. In 2012 the Independent Panel detailed how the fans were later unjustly blamed for the disaster. A report published on Tuesday by the NPCC and College of Policing said the spreading of lies and misinformation by the police in the wake of the disaster ""caused enormous distress to many people and still echo today.""  Chief Constable Andy Marsh, head of the College of Policing, said: “Policing has profoundly failed those bereaved by the Hillsborough disaster over many years and we are sorry that the service got it so wrong.  Police failures were the main cause of the tragedy and have continued to blight the lives of family members ever since. “When leadership was most needed, the bereaved were often treated insensitively and the response lacked coordination and oversight.""  He said Hillsborough was a ""touchstone for long-lasting change in policing"" and there is a commitment to create a ""modern, dynamic police service which acts without fear or favour, and with integrity and empathy. Mr Marsh said the changes include all police forces in England and Wales signing up to a charter agreeing to acknowledge when mistakes have been made and not seek to ""defend the indefensible""; a strengthened ethical policy which makes candour a key theme; and new guidance for specialist officers supporting families during a tragedy which learnt lessons from the Hillsborough Families Report, the Grenfell Tower tragedy and the 2017 terrorist attacks.  Bishop James Jones' 2017 review found ""a change in attitude"" was needed to ensure the ""pain and suffering"" of Hillsborough families was not repeated. The report called for a charter for bereaved families, the right to publicly-funded legal representation and a ""duty of candour"" for police officers. It also praised the families' ""exceptional"" tenacity over 28 years.  Speaking earlier on Tuesday, Mr Jones said it is ""intolerable"" that the Government has not responded more than five years on. He said: ""I think we have to put ourselves in the shoes of the families. ""This year it will be 34 years since the tragedy, and for them to wait for so long for a response to these 25 points of learning is intolerable and adds to their pain and, I think, in some instances even affects their own grieving.""   Margaret Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son James died in the disaster at an FA Cup semi-final, said: ""I remember writing - I don't know who it was to - to somebody in Government to say I hope this report does not get put on a shelf gathering dust for years like other things in the past have done.  ""We are now in 2023. How long does it take to read a report, to come out with your findings or what you think should happen?""  Last October, after a recommendation in Mr Jones's report, the Home Office said it had established an independent review to consider what went wrong with the original pathology report into the deaths. But there was no consultation with the bereaved families before the announcement, it emerged. At the time, the Home Office said it was committed to responding to the report ""as soon as practicable"".

Neil Kinnock warned you about the Tories 40 years ago - and now he's warning you again,"Neil Kinnock gave his famous 'I warn you' speech just days before Margaret Thatcher won the 1983 general election by a landslide, 40 years later, he says his prophetic words are now ""so close to reality""Neil Kinnock was sitting in the back of the family Ford Sierra, a clipboard balanced on his knees.  In the driving seat was his wife, Glenys. The M4 flashed past as the couple headed to Bridgend in South Wales for the penultimate day of the 1983 general election campaign.  With two days to go, Mr Kinnock, the then Shadow Education Secretary, had done over 90 meetings in 21 days. “I was bloody desperate,” he says. “Punch-drunk by that point. “I was losing my voice and would lose it altogether on election day. It never fully recovered.”  As the car motored on, the 41-year-old Labour MP started writing a speech to be given in front of a packed crowd in Bridgend that night and broadcast live on ITV News at Ten.  “If Margaret Thatcher wins on Thursday,” he wrote.   “I warn you not to be ordinary. I warn you not to be young. I warn you not to fall ill. I warn you not to get old.”  This year is the 40th anniversary of that famous speech – perhaps his most powerful – just as the country reaches the exact moment it foretold. “I warned you,” Baron Kinnock of Bedwellty, as he is now known, says, looking over the text as he re-reads it exclusively for the Mirror. “It’s all there. The appalling thing about the speech is that it’s become so close to reality. Want more stories like this straight to your inbox? Sign up to Ros Wynne Jones' Mirror Together newsletter HERE.  “There’s even a section about them taking away the right to protest. That has come true.  Baron Kinnock, now 80, adds: “The warnings about the NHS, pensioner poverty, the cold, fuel charges, transport, the crime rate – all of it.  “We’ve got a government now that’s waging economic warfare against its own people. “And the only other government doing that is Putin’s government.”   In 1983, Margaret Thatcher had already been Prime Minister for four years, but the most bitterly painful time for communities like Islwyn, where Baron Kinnock was MP, were yet to come. Two days after the speech, the Iron Lady won by a landslide. A month later, Kinnock was lucky to escape the Ford Sierra with his life following a high-speed crash on the M4.  Weeks later, in October 1983, he was elected leader of the Labour Party with 72% of the vote.   If the famous “I warn you” speech often seemed prophetic during the 1980s, now it reads like reportage. “When Margaret Thatcher was in power, she had all the council house sales, and the sell-off of BT, electricity, gas, water, the North Sea oil bonanza all went to the Treasury,” Baron Kinnock says. “It masked a lot of the damage.”  Her pale imitators David Cameron and George Osborne had no such flow of easy revenue.  “They used the banking crisis to get away with the underfunding of public services including the NHS and local government,” Baron Kinnock says. “Taken cumulatively, that was ruinous. Neglect is hugely costly. What’s happening now has been accumulating for 13 years.  “The Labour Party’s election slogan for the 1964 general election was ‘13 wasted years’ under successive Conservative administrations. By next year we will have had 14 fruitless years under the Tories. Worse than that, the areas of biggest need have seen the biggest cuts.  Other shocks – Brexit, which Baron Kinnock opposed, the pandemic and the Truss and Kwarteng economic bin fire among them – have turbo-charged the damage done by austerity.   “I mean, what was that?” Baron Kinnock asks, reflecting on Liz Truss ’ premiership. “It will take the families and the economy years and years to recover from those few weeks.”  The 1983 speech was long enough ago that after he wrote it on a piece of paper attached to the clipboard, he then phoned it through to his secretary who typed it up and faxed it to him at the school in Bridgend so he could hand it to the Press Association.  But as we go through the speech line by line, four decades fall away. “I warn you that you will have poverty – when pensions slip, and benefits are whittled away,” reads one section. Another says: “I warn you that you will be cold – when fuel charges are used as a tax system that the rich don’t notice and the poor can’t afford.” Perhaps most ominous is the line: “I warn you that you will be quiet.” It comes as the right to strike is being attacked in the Commons and rights to protest have already been restricted. “The only thing I didn’t talk about was inequality,” Baron Kinnock says.  “If you look at the FT’s figures, the proportion of total wealth owned by the 1% in Britain is the same now as 1913. We have stepped back a century.” It is the broken rubble of the NHS most commentators are referring to when they think of Bridgend in 1983 – and the line “I warn you not to fall ill”. It was Baron Kinnock’s father Gordon who took him to hear the local MP Aneurin “Nye” Bevan, who would go on to found the NHS. Gordon was treated by the Tredegar Medical Aid Society – the model for the NHS – when he suffered from a skin condition that meant he had to give up work in the mines. Baron Kinnock says: “The Tredegar Medical Aid Society worked so well that my father saw the best dermatologist in the world, paid for by the scheme. Unfortunately, it didn’t work and he ended up in the steelworks, heartbroken to leave mining.  “In the end the dust in the steelworks turned out to be even worse for his skin. He called this ‘nature’s little joke’.” But it’s his mum Mary who Baron Kinnock says would be most shocked by the state of her beloved health service. “My mother was a district nurse for nearly 40 years and a staunch member of the Royal College of Nurses,” he says. “She was a socialist and a trade unionist, but she always said that nurses don’t go on strike. “When I asked why, she said because of the patients, and because you don’t become a nurse unless you have a sense of duty. I know she would be on strike now.”  He adds laughing: “Britain is the only place where you find people on picket lines saying, ‘we’re right but we’re also very sorry’. You wouldn’t hear workers on a picket line in France or Germany apologising.”  All the while US healthcare giants – like those Rishi Sunak met in California in December – are circling the NHS like sharks.  Baron Kinnock says: “We are talking gigantic vested interests and unlimited resources dedicated to privatisation.” He adds: “The Tories want to turn nurses and doctors and ambulance drivers and train drivers into gig economy jobs.”  The Labour Party has inherited a broken country before, most dramatically in 1945. Should Keir Starmer ’s party be returned to power, it will also have to gather up the pieces.   “We face a gigantic post-war-sized challenge in a country that hasn’t been used to the privations and regulations of war,” Baron Kinnock says. “At the time of Atlee’s government people were used to conforming to wartime conditions. When peace came, they were willing to keep calm and carry on. Now, we’re not coming out of a war, but we have to face up to the reality of damage on the scale of warfare. “This time when we fix it, we’ve got to let people know that progress is the result of applied Labour values and policies so that they don’t think that advances simply arrived by accident.” In the four decades since writing the speech, Neil Kinnock did grow older, if never ordinary.  His five grandchildren are young. His beloved wife, Glenys, has fallen ill with Alzheimer’s, something he has recently spoken movingly about. But that is the point of the speech. We are – or will be – all of those things he listed in the back of the Ford Sierra. That’s why Bevan and his Labour heirs built the welfare state. And that’s why 40 years later Neil Kinnock’s hoarse and urgent speech at Bridgend reminds us all to defend it.

Tories in crisis as party's chief executive and treasurer dragged into tax dodging row,"Tory treasurer Graham Edwards was found to have used a tax avoidance scheme, while the party's chief executive Stephen Massey still works for a firm that helps the rich slash their tax billsRishi Sunak faces a fresh crisis as two Tory bosses are dragged into a tax dodging row. The Mirror can reveal Graham Edwards, who has been brought in by the PM to run the party’s finances, was found to have used a tax avoidance scheme. And Tory chief executive Stephen Massey is still working on the side for a firm that encouraged the rich to slash their tax bills by ploughing cash into a controversial movie investment project. Labour’s Anneliese Dodds last night said: “From the party chair sacked over his tax affairs to the party treasurer who took part in a tax avoidance scheme, Rishi Sunak is drowning in a swamp of sleaze. “Rishi Sunak promised professionalism, integrity and accountability at every level, but instead we’ve got a torrent of questions over those he put at the top of the Conservative Party."" Property tycoon Mr Edwards, who has donated £940,000 to the Conservatives since 2018, was named as the party’s treasurer last month.     Following a dispute with HMRC, he was found to have wrongly tried to reduce the tax due on £5million he received in bonuses. According to court documents, a trust set up as part of a complex tax scheme was used to buy a £1.5million country mansion for him. The property in Buckinghamshire has its own boathouse on the banks of the Thames as well as a heated swimming pool and tennis court. A tax tribunal ruled that the scheme was tax avoidance in 2007. He challenged the decision in both the High Court and Court of Appeal, but his appeals were dismissed. Mr Massey started as the Conservative Party’s chief executive in November, but he remains chairman of firm Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management, where he has worked for the past decade.  Rich clients launched legal action against the company in 2019 after it advised them to put their money into a film investment scheme that was targeted by the taxman. They complained that an HMRC crackdown had left them with huge bills. On its website, Canaccord Genuity boasts that it helps its wealth customers invest ""in the most tax-efficient manner"". Mr Massey has donated £343,000 to the Tories including £25,000 to Mr Sunak’s leadership campaign. He has temporarily been handed the duties of the Conservative Party chairman after Nadhim Zahawi was sacked for not telling the truth over an HMRC investigation he faced for not paying enough tax. A spokesman for Mr Massey last night said he had “no involvement in the advice related to this case, which arose in a company acquired by Canaccord before he was employed by the firm”. A spokesman for Mr Edwards said: “Two decades ago Mr Edwards received a bonus and paid full tax and National Insurance on it, on the day he received it. “The scheme mentioned was a KPMG led tax reclaim scheme that HMRC disallowed. Mr. Edwards paid all taxes properly and never received any penalty from HMRC. “Mr Edwards bought the property mentioned with fully taxed income.” The Conservative Party declined to comment. Mr Sunak yesterday insisted he had acted ""pretty decisively"" as he faced criticism for dithering for a fortnight before giving Mr Zahawi the boot. * Follow Mirror Politics on Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter and Facebook.

Government's 'sacking of nurses bill' would make 'Henry VIII turn in his grave',"Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said the controversial Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill is ""an attack on our basic British freedoms"" as protesters gathered outside Downing Street Henry VIII would ""spin in his grave"" in astonishment at the government's controversial ""sacking of nurses bill"", MPs have been told. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner this evening accused ministers of ""going from clapping workers to sacking workers"" by rushing anti-strike laws through Parliament. She voiced her fury over new legislation which would allow the government to set minimum service levels if workers such as nurses and ambulance workers go on strike. Critics warn the ""undemocratic, unworkable and almost certainly illegal"" bill will only serve to escalate disputes and undermine the right to strike. Addressing the House of Commons Ms Rayner fumed: ""Members opposite should be very concerned about what this Government is trying to do.   ""Henry VIII would spin in his grave and be absolutely, you know, astonished that we're even trying to do this type of thing in this modern day."" The remark came after Labour backbencher Barry Gardiner said the government is ""authorising employers to do what not even a court in this country can do"". The government is desperately floundering under the weight of industrial action by key workers - with firefighters today joining NHS medics, rail staff and civil servants in voting for strikes. Ms Rayner said: ""This bill is an attack on our basic British freedoms... It's from a Prime Minister who's desperately out of his depth, desperately blaming working people for his own failures."" Protesters descended on Downing Street as MPs debated the Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill - which would force workers to cross the picket line or face sanctions.  Hundreds of banner-waving demonstrators rallied against the bill, with RMT assistant secretary general John Leach telling the crowd: ""They've picked a fight with the wrong people. ""We will not be shackled, we will not be tied down."" In the chamber, Ms Rayner's remarks got support from an unexpected source, with former Tory minister Jacob Rees-Mogg hitting out at the vague wording of the bill. Mr Rees-Mogg said: ""What the honourable lady said about Henry VIII clauses is absolutely spot on. ""Indeed, I hope that should the socialists ever be in government in future they will remember what she said because skeleton bills and Henry VIII clauses are bad parliamentary and constitutional practice."" Last week, while at the World Economic Forum in Davos, ILO director general Gilbert Houngbo reportedly expressed concern about the Government's plans.  Union TUC's general secretary Paul Nowak said: ""The Government is trying to keep MPs in the dark about the draconian nature of this Bill. ""But make no mistake - this legislation will give ministers sweeping new powers to restrict the right to strike. ""The Government must not be allowed to duck scrutiny. This spiteful legislation would mean that when workers democratically vote to strike, they can be forced to work and sacked if they don't comply. ""The Minimum Service Levels Bill is undemocratic, unworkable and almost certainly illegal, and crucially it will likely poison industrial relations and exacerbate disputes rather than help resolve them. ""It is shameful that parliamentarians are being forced to vote blindly on such far-reaching new laws. We urge MPs from all parties to vote against this nasty Bill."" The government argues that the move is necessary in order to protect the public, despite unions themselves agreeing to ensure emergency cover during recent NHS strikes. A government spokesperson said: ""We must keep the public safe, which is why we are introducing minimum service and safety levels across a range of sectors to ensure that lives and livelihoods are not lost."" The Government will publish an impact assessment of the legislation ""in due course"". ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/governments-sacking-nurses-bill-would-29088074
'No one wants to see kids miss more school but striking teachers NEED to be heard',"The Voice of the Mirror says the Tories have exploited and undervalued teachers after years of plummeting wages, and strikes must lead to meaningful negotiationsAfter years of plummeting wages, teachers will strike tomorrow feeling exploited and undervalued by the Tories. No one wants children to miss more lessons after the disruption of Covid, including the staff who educate the future of our country.  And that is why the action by the National Education Union must be a signal for meaningful negotiations.  A failure to table a decent pay offer by the Government, which seems to relish confrontation rather than reach common ground, would be a disaster for children. Firefighters voting to strike and tomorrow’s co-ordinated action, also involving train drivers and civil servants, is a national workforce demanding a reasonable wage rise. Union leaders are ready to negotiate. Missing at the table are the politicians we blame for the industrial strife.  Taxing times  Does the Conservative Party think tax is only for the little people to pay?  The question must be asked when sacked Tory chair Nadhim Zahawi isn’t the only key member of Rishi Sunak’s team accused of not paying their fair whack.   The disclosure that property tycoon Graham Edwards, hired to run the party’s finances, faced his own bill over a tax avoidance scheme is setting alarm bells ringing.  So too is the party’s chief executive Stephen Massey, working on the side for a firm urging clients to use another tax avoidance scheme. Senior Tories are looking after themselves during the bitter cost of living crisis. But raising taxes to post-war record rates for the rest of us proves they are not fit to rule. Blast from past  Neil Kinnock’s warning not to be ordinary, young, ill or old under the Tories is as resonant today as it was in the 80s. The Labour titan re-recording his blistering speech about Conservative rule will send hope soaring and have people demanding a general election to kick them out of government.

Coastal communities living in terror with £600m of homes in danger of plunging into sea,"Countless Brits up and down the country live in fear their homes will get wiped off the map by the every new storm as many don't even know they're being left at the mercy of the wavesCoastal communities are living in fear that every new storm could be the one that will send their home plummeting into the sea. Erosion accelerated by global warming could wipe out £600million worth of coastal homes in 21 communities in England by the end of the century, a climate action group warns. Many residents do not know a decision has been taken not to build new sea defences in their area, meaning homes will be left at the mercy of the waves. Over a third of England’s coastline has a designation of “no active intervention” under the Environment Agency’s ­shoreline management plans, according to action group One Home. Yet new developments can continue to be built in these areas, potentially increasing the number of at-risk homes.   Some people could even be forced to pay thousands of pounds towards the cost of demolishing their own home if it is threatened by erosion, possibly while still paying their mortgage. One Home has produced a map showing the most at-risk areas and those that will not be fortified. Chief Angela Terry said: “Sea levels are rising as global temperatures soar and so larger waves batter our coast during severe storms. “These irreversible changes mean some cliff faces are crumbling fast. “We can’t turn the tide or build a wall around the entire coast, so we urgently need to help seaside communities to prepare for the damage that will come.”  The north Norfolk villages of Bacton, Walcott and Ostend will be worst hit, with 412 properties expected to be lost by 2100, with another 135 homes at risk a few miles south in Hemsby. Along the coast around Hollym, East Yorks, 306 homes are at risk. Communities in Cornwall, Cumbria, Dorset, Essex, the Isle of Wight, Kent, Northumberland and Sussex will also be affected. No compensation scheme exists for those whose homes are threatened, Angela warned. Demolition grants up to £6,000 are available for those whose homes cannot be saved, but costs above this must be met by the owner. Angela added: “Shoreline management plans are publicly available ­documents but most people are unaware of their existence. Many homeowners don’t know their properties are at risk or that decisions have been made about whether to protect them or not.  “But they are not statutory, so new developments can continue. Funding is not guaranteed, so even where ­communities have been chosen to be saved, the money might not be there.” The threat to homes is taking its toll on residents, said Ian Brennan of the Save Hemsby Coastline charity, set up 10 years ago when a storm surge claimed homes in the Norfolk community. He said: “People here are very nervous. Every time there’s a storm those who live within sight and sound of the sea fear it will be the one that means they lose their home. It takes a huge toll on mental health.” The group is seeking permission and funding for rock berm defences, estimated to cost at least £5million. Ian said: “It will buy time to allow people to adapt their lives.”  In Thorpeness, Suffolk, TV producer Lucy Ansbro, 54, has spent £500,000 protecting her home from erosion. She said her neighbour’s £2m house was demolished in October as receding cliffs made it unsafe.  She added: “I was aware there was a threat of erosion when I bought this house in 2009. However, the worst-case scenario predicted losing five metres to the sea within 50 years – but, in fact, I lost five metres in 2020 alone.” The Environment Agency said: “From 2015 to 2021, we invested £1.2billion to better protect around 200,000 homes from coastal erosion and sea flooding. “However, climate change means that our coast is changing at an accelerated rate, meaning in some places we and coastal authorities will need to help local communities adapt and transition away from the current coastline.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/coastal-communities-live-terror-600m-29090450
Rishi Sunak asked when he will pay nurses 'properly' after speech on NHS,"The Prime Minister was taking questions from health workers and members of the public on the NHS as he was told the issue of nurses' pay was the 'elephant in the room' Rishi Sunak has been confronted over when he will pay hard-pressed nurses ""properly"" with the issue described as the ""elephant in the room"" during his speech on the NHS. It comes as the health service faces a major crisis, with a record backlog of over 7million patients and the biggest strike action in NHS history next week when paramedics and nurses walkout. Addressing NHS workers and members of the public on Monday in Darlington, Mr Sunak promised the ""fastest-ever"" improvement in emergency waiting times - after record delays. But one individual in the audience told the Tory Prime Minister the issue of nurses' pay - a key issue in the strike action - was the ""elephant in the room"". They asked: ""When are you going to pay them properly?"". In response Mr Sunak said he would ""love"" to pay NHS staff ""lots more"" - but said he did not have a ""magic wand"" to do so. The PM also warned those present that if the Government fails to bring down inflation it will create a ""vicious cycle"". Read More
  He added: ""An important part of us getting a grip of inflation and halving it is making sure the Government's responsible with its borrowing, because if that gets out of control that makes it worse and it's about making pay settlements reasonable and fair. ""When we've had periods of high inflation, what happened in the past is everyone said 'OK inflation was at 15% we should all get paid 15%' and then you have a kind of vicious cycle which you never recover from. ""It would be the wrong thing to do. Of course it would make my life easier to say 'yep, sure, great, let's just go ahead'. ""It would be a bad thing for all of you if that meant inflation was running really high in a year's time."" He said he could not raise taxes to pay for pay hikes, arguing: ""Where we are with taxes at the moment we can't put them up any more right, and we need to be getting them down."" The exchange came after the Government was accused of putting patients at risk by watering down ambulance A&E waiting times.  But Mr Sunak defended not setting an NHS target of responding to heart attacks and strokes within 18 minutes this year, as he said ""fingers crossed"" there will already have been improvements.  Asked about ambulance waiting times, the Prime Minister said: ""Of course it's not good enough, of course, gosh, what happened in December was not great, it was not great for any of you working in the NHS, it was not great for patients. ""We will get back to 30 minutes over the course of this year and then we will get back to pre-pandemic levels thereafter, I would say that is ambitious.""

NHS consultants to be balloted on strikes as thousands 'driven out of job they love',"The British Medical Association (BMA) warns that morale in the NHS ""has never been as low"" and a 35% real-terms pay cut since 2009 means top medics are being ""driven out of jobs they love""The NHS pay crisis could deepen still further, with consultants becoming the latest staff asked if they back strike action. Ministers have been warned that top medics are being ""driven out of jobs they love"" by the government's failure to act.. The British Medical Association (BMA) warned that staff shortages are having a ""catastrophic"" impact on patients, and said morale within the health service ""has never been as low"". it warns that senior medics have endured a 35% real-terms cut in their take home pay since the Tories took office - with many forced to cut back hours because of tax issues or leave the NHS entirely. If they opt to strike, it would be another escalation in a crisis which has already seen tens of thousands of nurses, ambulance workers and physiotherapists walk out in recent months.   And 45,000 junior doctors are also being balloted over strike action, with a result due to be announced next month. It ramps up pressure on Health Secretary Steve Barclay as unions clamour for a better pay deal for NHS staff who are struggling to make ends meet. Dr Vishal Sharma, chairman of the BMA consultants committee, accused ministers of being ""unwilling to act"" despite repeated warnings. He said: ""The NHS is on its knees, patients are suffering and staff morale has never been lower.  ""Senior doctors are cutting their hours or leaving the NHS in their droves, driven out of jobs they love by unfair pension tax rules and brutal cuts to their pay.""  The result on patients is ""catastrophic"", he said. The BMA today says it will hold an indicative ballot, allowing members to say if they would support strike action. This would have to be followed by a full ballot in order for industrial action to be legal. It accuses the government of interfering with the pay review process and calls for a complete shake-up of the way NHS pay is set. Dr Sharma said: ""The only way out of this crisis is to fix pay, fix pensions and fix the pay review body.  ""Consultants would not take industrial action lightly, but, in the absence of meaningful solutions from Government, we've been left with no option but to consult our members' views on whether they wish for us to hold a formal ballot for industrial action."" Saffron Cordery, NHS Providers’ interim chief executive, said: “The threat of more strikes is alarming for an overstretched NHS already battling to cope with the effects of the most widespread industrial action in its history."" She continued: “Pay is one key aspect of recruiting and retaining the staff which the NHS so desperately needs therefore it’s vital that the government sits down with the unions urgently to avert more strikes.""

"Boris Johnson's claim Putin threatened to kill him with missile is a 'lie', says Kremlin","Moscow insisted Russian president Vladimir Putin made 'no threats with missiles' to Boris Johnson in a telephone call that took place between the leaders ahead of the invasion of UkraineThe Kremlin has insisted Boris Johnson told ""a lie"" when he claimed Vladimir Putin threatened to kill him in a rocket attack. Ahead of the invasion of Ukraine, the ex-PM says the Russian President told him: “I don’t want to hurt you, but with a missile, it would only take a minute.” Mr Johnson said the ""extraordinary"" telephone conversation took place last February as fears grew that Putin was about to launch a war. But Moscow disputed the claim, saying there were ""no threats with missiles"" during the call. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Mr Johnson’s account ""was a lie"". ""There were no threats with missiles,"" Mr Peskov said during a conference call with reporters.

In an interview for a three-part BBC documentary on the difficult relationship between Putin and the West, Mr Johnson said he warned the Russian leader there would be tougher sanctions if he ordered an invasion of Ukraine. He also said he told him that the escalation would only see Western states increase support for Ukraine, meaning ""more Nato, not less Nato"" on Russia's borders. ""He said, 'Boris, you say that Ukraine is not going to join Nato any time soon. [...] What is any time soon?' and I said 'Well it's not going to join Nato for the foreseeable future. You know that perfectively well,”' Mr Johnson said of the call. ""He sort of threatened me at one point and said, 'Boris, I don't want to hurt you, but with a missile, it would only take a minute', or something like that.

"Sadiq Khan teases exciting 2040 London Olympics bid as he bigs up ""greenest Games ever""","Following the success of 2012, London's mayor has fuelled excitement among fans by hinting that the capital could host another Olympic Games less than two decades from nowMayor of London Sadiq Khan has teased a possible bid to host another Olympics in the capital. He spoke on the prospect of London welcoming the world for a fortnight of sporting brilliance once again in 2040, less than 30 years after the success of 2012.  ""We're working with colleagues to get a bid explored. 2032 and 2036 are a done deal,” the mayor told MyLondon. “The attraction of a deal for 2040 for London is it would be the greenest Olympics ever - watch this space.""  London 2012 was received incredibly well as thousands of fans from around the world descended on English shores for the showpiece event. Plenty of new champions were crowned while megastars cemented their legacy as the greatest in their respective sports.  The Mayor of London believes a potential Olympic Games could help to address some of London's long-term transport and infrastructure issues, just like London 2012, which saw big developments in the East London town of Stratford.  Khan previously stated that should London be awarded another Games, the aim would be to host the most environmentally friendly Olympics in history. The 52-year-old told Sky Sports News last July that he wanted to show the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the world that a mega sporting event could be held with green credentials, with the intent to reuse many of the venues used in 2012. ""We're working on a plan to bring the Olympics back to London, and I'll tell you why,"" said Khan. ""We've seen over the last few days the consequences of climate change in relation to the heatwaves, in relation to the grass fires. ""What we need is to make sure future games are green and what we're doing is working on a plan to have the greenest games ever. The great thing about London is you don't expend carbon on building new stadiums, new places to do cycling, new places to do swimming, because we've got all the kit. And so watch this space."" The UK government is optimistic about London’s chances of hosting another Games. This is due to the country's track record of hosting major sporting events, with another example as recently as last summer’s excellent Commonwealth Games.  “The UK has a long and successful track record of staging major sporting events that have the power to deliver wide-ranging economic benefits,” a UK Government source said. “These events bring the nation together, inspire greater participation and enhance our global reputation and a future Olympic Games could do just that. We’ve shown the world what we can do with London 2012 with our fantastic sportsmen and sportswomen making our country proud.” During the 2012 Olympics, Team GB earned 65 medals and matched the feat at the 2020 Games in Tokyo. Should another Games take place in the London 17 years from now, a new crop of British athletes will be keen to make their mark and become national heroes.

Michael Gove accused of watering down post-Grenfell housing safety contract,"Labour's Lisa Nandy today said that too little had been done to address safety concerns affecting millions in the five-and-a-half years since the Grenfell Tower tragedyMichael Gove has been accused of watering down housing safety steps despite tough talk on tackling rogue developers following the Grenfell tragedy. The Housing Secretary pledged that firms who do not sign a government contract committing to safety measures ""will have to find another line of work"". He told MPs that any companies that do not sign the document within six weeks will be banned from future developments. But his Labour counterpart, Lisa Nandy, questioned whether Mr Gove had rolled back on the level of liability firms face. She hit out over lengthy delays millions have faced in getting dangerous cladding removed in the wake of the 2017 fire, which claimed 72 lives.   Ms Nandy told the Commons: ""The Secretary of State has claimed he's being tough on this before. It has been one year since he last made this demand on developers. ""The reality is that five-and-a-half years after the appalling Grenfell fire, millions of people are still trapped in buildings with dangerous cladding, in flats that are unsellable and facing eye-watering bills."" The Government has published the contract it expects companies to sign by March 13 in order to be able to carry on constructing homes. But according to Housing Today, homebuilders only agreed to sign it after the government made a string of concessions, including agreeing that work funded under the pledge should be limited to ""life-critical building safety improvements"". Ms Nandy referred to reports that two major housebuilders had agreed to sign the contracts ""after he watered it down, to limit their liability, restrict the work that is covered and prevent the Government from revisiting the contract at a later date"".  She pointed out that Mr Gove had made a similar ultimatum a year ago, but said little had been done. ""Only 7% of flats at fire risk have been fixed,"" she told MPs.. ""This has been another year with lives on hold, huge anxiety, countless human misery and people are losing hope.""  The remarks came after Mr Gove vowed to force firms to sign up to a ""responsible actors scheme"" or face the consequences. He said: ""Anyone who fails to sign the contract will be prohibited from carrying out future development and from receiving building control sign-offs for buildings under construction.  ""If you're a developer, if you fail to sign this contract, you will have to find another line of work."" He told MPs that the contract had been the result of extensive negotiations with housing companies. Mr Gove admitted that there had been a ""collective failure"" to maintain minimum safety standards, with government regulations not always clear. He said he is banning the ""unacceptable practice"" of managing agents, landlords and freeholders charging leaseholders commissions when they take out property insurance.

Two in three Brits think the country needs a new Government at next election,"As Rishi Sunak approaches 100 days in Downing Street, the Ispos Political Monitor found that 66% of voters believe it's time for change, regardless of whether they think the Tories have done a good job or notTwo in three voters think the country needs a new Government at the next election, a new survey shows. The Ipsos Political Monitor - run between January 18-25 - found a clear majority wants to punish the Tories at the ballot box. The survey said a massive 66% think it's time for a change, regardless of whether they think the Tories have done a good job or not. Some 70% believe the Conservatives have done a poor job while just 20% described the Government as competent - compared to 62% who labelled it incompetent.  As Rishi Sunak approaches 100 days in No10, the poll for Ispos also showed Labour enjoying a 25-point lead over the Conservatives.  Read More
  It comes after a torrid fortnight for the Prime Minister who was issued with a fixed penalty notice and was forced into sacking Tory Chairman Nadhim Zahawi.  Meanwhile, Keir Starmer leads Rishi Sunak on who the public think would make the most capable Prime Minister by a margin of 39% to 33%.  In November, Mr Sunak led the Labour leader by 41% to 35%. But 44% of those surveyed said they do not know what Mr Starmer stands for compared to 40% for the Prime Minister. Gideon Skinner, the head of political research at Ipsos, said: ""Both Rishi Sunak and his party still face significant challenges at the polls. ""The public remain sceptical about how effectively the Government can deliver on their main concerns on public services, the economy and cost of living, and now the Prime Minister's own ratings are also slipping"". He added: ""Combined with much less apprehension about the prospect of a Labour government than in 2019, this is all helping to create a sense among Britons that it is time for a change. ""However, there are also areas for Labour to be wary of - Keir Starmer still has more to do to define what he stands for, and while 2019 Conservative voters are hardly happy with the way the Government is running the country, this group still needs more convincing that things would be better under Labour"". Ipsos interviewed a representative sample of 1,001 adults aged 18+ across Great Britain. Interviews were conducted by telephone between 18-25 January 2023.

Firefighters vote overwhelmingly to strike in historic 999 walkout,"The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) today said members had voted overwhelmingly for industrial action after more than a decade of real-terms pay cuts and a ""derisory"" offer by the governmentAround 30,000 firefighters and control staff are set to go on strike after voting overwhelmingly for industrial action. Members of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) will walk out for the first time in 20 years as anger grows over a rejected 5% pay rise offer. The union said 999 workers have been forced to use foodbanks after years of ""derisory"" pay increases. This afternoon the FBU said 88% of members who voted had backed the walkout, giving a ""decisive mandate"" for industrial action.  No dates have yet been set for nationwide strikes - the first since 2003 - but the union says an announcement will be made ""in the coming weeks"" if an improved offer isn't made. Since the Tories took power in 2010, the FBU says, firefighters have endured a 12% real-terms pay cut – equivalent to around £4,000 a year on average.  It adds that in the same period around one in five firefighter jobs have been cut.   Matt Wrack, FBU general secretary, said the move is a ""last resort"" - and said the union has given the government 10 days to make an improved offer. He said: ""Firefighters across the UK have spoken. The Fire Brigades Union has a decisive mandate for strike action.  ""This is an overwhelming vote for strike action against an offer which would mean further significant cuts to real terms wages for firefighters and control room staff. They have already lost at least 12% of the value of their pay since 2010.  ""This is an absolute last resort for our members. The responsibility for any disruption to services lies squarely with fire service employers and government ministers.  ""Rishi Sunak's government has refused to make funding available for a decent pay offer to firefighters and control staff."" Polling shows around 58% of the public support firefighters and control room staff in taking industrial action. Labour's Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: “Firefighters run towards danger when the rest of us run away. They put their lives and their health at risk to rescue others and they need fair pay and conditions. “No one, including firefighters themselves, wants a strike. It is this Conservative government’s reckless behaviour that has crashed the economy, and their failure to get a grip on inflation means working people are struggling more and more. This is their mess to fix."" The Prime Minister's official spokesman this afternoon described the decision to strike as ""disappointing"".  Last month the FBU contrasted the pay of top fire chiefs with that of a “competent wholetime firefighter” who is paid £32,244. Mr Wrack said then: “Firefighters and control staff are facing yet another real terms pay cut while fire chiefs rake in huge salaries. “FBU members are increasingly facing real in-work poverty, with firefighters having to rely on foodbanks and take on additional jobs to afford the basics. “At the same time, some fire chiefs are also trying to persuade firefighters and control staff to step back from industrial action, to simply shut up about salaries that are several times smaller than their bosses’. “It’s insulting and stinks of the hypocrisy of some chief officers who refuse to make the case for better pay for their workers. “Chief fire officers are not worth six times more than firefighters - it was the latter who were called key workers during the pandemic delivering vital services, including moving the bodies of the deceased. “Firefighters and control staff are being left with no other choice but to take action.” The Home Office has drawn up plans to draft in the military if tens of thousands of 999 heroes walkout over pay.

Boris Johnson reveals Vladimir Putin threatened to kill him in missile attack,"The ex-PM said the 'extraordinary' telephone conversation took place last February after he visited Kyiv in a last-ditch attempt to show support for Ukraine amid growing fears of a Russian assault.Boris Johnson has claimed that Vladimir Putin threatened to kill him in a rocket attack. The ex-PM said the Russian President told him: “I don’t want to hurt you, but with a missile, it would only take a minute.”  Mr Johnson said the ""extraordinary"" telephone conversation took place last February after he visited Kyiv in a last-ditch attempt to show support for Ukraine amid growing fears of a Russian assault.   Speaking in a new three-part BBC documentary on the difficult relationship between Putin and the West, Mr Johnson said he warned the Russian leader there would be tougher sanctions if he ordered an invasion of Ukraine.  He also said he told him that the escalation would only see Western states increase support for Ukraine, meaning ""more Nato, not less Nato"" on Russia's borders. ""He said, 'Boris, you say that Ukraine is not going to join Nato any time soon. [...] What is any time soon?' and I said 'Well it's not going to join Nato for the foreseeable future. You know that perfectively well,”' Mr Johnson said of the call. Read More
  ""He sort of threatened me at one point and said, 'Boris, I don't want to hurt you, but with a missile, it would only take a minute', or something like that. ""I think from the very relaxed tone that he was taking, the sort of air of detachment that he seemed to have, he was just playing along with my attempts to get him to negotiate.""  Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, who was also interviewed for the programme, spoke of his visit to Moscow in the same month to meet Russia's minister of defence Sergei Shoigu, as well as chief of general staff Valery Gerasimov.  ""And I remember saying to Minister Shoigu 'they will fight' and he said, 'my mother is Ukrainian, they won't!'. He also said he had no intention of invading,"" Mr Wallace said. ""That would be 'Vran'e' in the Russian language. 'Vran'e' I think is sort of a demonstration of bullying or strength: I'm going to lie to you. You know I'm lying. I know you know I'm lying and I'm still going to lie to you. He knew I knew and I knew he knew. But I think it was about saying: I'm powerful. ""It was the fairly chilling but direct lie of what they were not going to do that I think to me confirmed they were going to do it. I remember as we were walking out General Gerasimov said, 'Never again will we be humiliated. We used to be the fourth army in the world, we're now number two. It's now America and us.' And there in that minute was that sense of potentially why [they were doing this]."" Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed in the programme his efforts to win over Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.

  ""I told him: 'Jens, I want to join Nato, do you see us in Nato?' Because nothing would defend our country except for actual membership,"" Mr Zelensky said. ""I said: 'It's just unfair and not nice. You don't see us as equals.' I told him that our army is ready, our society is ready, and I believed that Nato is not ready.""  Mr Zelensky details his frustration with the Nato position in advance of the conflict. ""If you know that tomorrow Russia will occupy Ukraine, why don't you give me something today I can stop it with? Or if you can't give it to me, then stop it yourself.""

Eight money changes coming in February including Universal Credit and passport shake-up,"There are plenty of money changes coming up in February that could impact your wallet - from inflation and interest rate announcements to changes to Universal CreditThe cost of living crisis is continuing to push up prices and bills for millions of households across the UK. This means keeping an eye on your finances has never been more important - and there are plenty of money changes coming up in February that could impact your wallet.  There are upcoming inflation and interest rate announcements coming in the next few weeks, as well as changes to Universal Credit.  There is also more energy discounts due in February - but this comes alongside another update from Ofgem regarding its price cap. Here is everything you need to know.  Passport fees increasing - February 2  The price of renewing your passport will rise by around 9% on February 2. The price for an adult applying online will go up from £75.50 to £82.50, and from £49 to £53.50 for a child. For paper applications, the cost for an adult will rise from £85 to £93, and from £58.50 to £64 for a child. Fast track and premium same-day services are going up as well. At the moment, adults pay £142 for a fast track (one week) service but this will rise to £155, or from £122 to £126 for a child. If you need same day service, the cost of for an adult is rising from £177 to £193.50. Interest rates - February 2 The Bank of England will announce whether interest rates will be raised again on February 2. The central bank increased its base rate on December 15 to its highest level in 14 years, from 3% to 3.5%. The base rate is what the Bank of England charges other banks and lenders - this in turn then influences the rates you are charged as a customer when you borrow money. If interest rates are higher, you'll pay more to borrow on products like mortgages and cheaper loans and credit card rates tend to disappear. GDP figures - February 10  The ONS will reveal its latest gross domestic product (GDP) figures on February 10. GDP is a measure of the size and health of the economy, to show whether it has grown or shrunk in a certain period. Last month, the ONS said the UK economy unexpectedly grew by 0.1% in the month to November, boosted by food and drink sales during the World Cup. But in not so good news, GDP fell by 0.3% between September to November. Should a reading by the ONS for the October to December period show negative growth, then the economy will officially be in recession. This is defined as two consecutive quarters - so six months - of economic contracting.   Inflation - February 15 The Office for National Statistics (ONS) will release the inflation rate for the 12 months to January on February 15. Inflation is a figure used to explain how much the prices of goods and services have increased over time. When inflation is high, it means prices have risen more sharply and you’re getting less for your money than before. Inflation has nudged down slightly is currently at 10.5% - this is down from 41-year high of 11.1%. Universal Credit rule change - February 26  Thousands of Universal Credit claimants will be pushed into looking for work or increasing the number of hours they already do. Currently, benefit claimants working 12 hours a week at the National Living Wage are not required to meet regularly with their Jobcentre coach. But this threshold is being increased to 15 hours a week, or 24 hours week if you're in a couple, meaning more people will be pressured into looking for a job or increasing their hours or work. These regulations will come into force today (January 30) and the change will start impacting claimants from February 26, 2023. If you’re told you need to look for work, but you fail to do so, you could risk being sanctioned and your benefits temporarily reduced or stopped.  Ofgem price cap announcement - February 27 Ofgem will announce its energy price cap for April to June on February 27. Households are currently covered by the Energy Price Guarantee, which has set the typical energy bill at £2,500 a year. This will rise to £3,000 a year from April. But the boss of Ofgem Jonathan Brearley last week said it was ""possible"" the price cap could fall below £3,000 in April due to a fall in wholesale gas and electricity prices. This would be more optimistic than what analysts at Cornwall Insight have recently suggested - they're predicting the Ofgem price cap could hit £3,209 from April. If this was to happen, the Energy Price Guarantee would remain in place and keep prices to £3,000 on average. Cornwall Insight suggests the typical bill under the Ofgem price cap could drop to around £2,200 a year from July. Of course, there isn't actually a total cap on how much you can pay for energy. What both the Energy Price Guarantee and Ofgem price cap do is put a limit on how much you can be charged for unit rates and standing charges. No set date... Water bill rise confirmed? Last year, Water UK announced how much water bills would rise by on February 4 - so a similar announcement could be due early February. Water bills rise change April and how much your bill could rise by depends on where you live and your usage. Unfortunately, you can't switch water suppliers - you're assigned on based on which part of the country you live in. But some households could be set to see their water bills go down. It comes after the regulator Ofwater ordered 11 companies to cut customer bills after they missed targets on things like pollution and supply interruptions.  Next £67 energy bill discount The fifth energy bill discount payment, worth £400 in total, will be sent out in February. The £400 is being split up into six instalments. Households have already received £66 in October and November and £67 in December and January - £266 in total. Further payments worth £67 will be sent in February and March. When you receive your discount depends on when - and how - you pay your bill. Direct debit customers get the discount automatically - either as a deduction to your monthly direct debit, or as a refund to your bank account. If you pay on receipt of your bill, the discount is applied as credit to your energy account each month. Smart prepayment meter customers also get the discount automatically each month. If you're a prepay customer, you will be sent discount vouchers by text, email or post - you'll then need to manually redeem these.

Tories engulfed by sleaze as Rishi Sunak branded 'weak' over Nadhim Zahawi sacking,"Rishi Sunak dithered for a fortnight and then finally fired the Conservative Party chairman for breaking ministerial rules seven timesRishi Sunak came under fire from fellow Tories over his feeble handling of the Nadhim Zahawi dishonesty scandal. After a fortnight of dithering, the PM finally axed the party Chairman for breaking ministerial rules seven times by trying to cover up the fact he was facing a probe into his tax affairs. But with his party mired in sleaze, Mr Sunak was branded weak and warned he faces being dragged down by a string of scandals. It comes as Mr Zahawi refused to apologise and even blamed the press for reporting his rule-breaking. One Tory MP said: “We picked Rishi as he was supposed to be the new broom to clean up Boris’s mess, but it’s been worse. You cannot move for dirt.”   Michael Portillo insisted the PM should have sacked Zahawi as soon as it became clear he was not being honest, instead of ordering a probe by ethics chief Sir Laurie Magnus. The Tory heavyweight said: “It pains me to say this, but I think on the whole it makes Rishi look weak. He must have been kicking himself that he decided to refer this to an investigation rather than going with a decision straight away.” Former Chancellor George Osborne added: “The ­question for Rishi Sunak was whether his high ratings could pull the Tory party up, or the party’s low ratings would pull him down. “And at the moment, he is being pulled down by a series of scandals.” Tory MP Lee Anderson compared the government to “the band on the Titanic” which played on as it sank.  Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said the “hopelessly weak PM has been dragged kicking and screaming into doing what he should have done long ago”. She added: “Rishi Sunak shouldn’t have needed an ethics adviser to tell him Nadhim Zahawi’s position was untenable. He continued to prop up the man he appointed to Cabinet.” The PM told Mr Zahawi he was fired in a letter after Sir Laurie’s probe.  But despite the former minister paying a penalty of close to £1million for not paying enough tax, Mr Sunak heaped lavish praise on him for his ­“achievements” in Government. Mr Zahawi also gushed about himself in his written reply, which contained no mention of his rule breaking or any hint of remorse. Instead, he said he was “concerned about the conduct from some of the fourth estate” – members of the press who legitimately reported on his actions. Sir Laurie said in a damning report there had been a “serious failure” by the MP for Stratford-on-Avon to follow the rules on being “open and honest”. While he was Chancellor last summer, millionaire Mr Zahawi paid around £5million to the tax office to settle a dispute, including the penalty. Sir Laurie found he had ­repeatedly failed to tell officials he was being investigated by HMRC despite the obvious potential conflict of interest. The ethics chief said even when he started his Cabinet jobs as Education Secretary and Chancellor and had to fill in Whitehall forms that ­specifically asked about “tax affairs, ­investigations and disputes” he did not mention it. Mr Zahawi agreed to pay a penalty to HMRC in August. But he again failed to declare this at the time or later when he was appointed to posts by both Liz Truss and Mr Sunak.  The report also found he had not told the truth last July when he claimed reports that he was being investigated by the tax office were ­“inaccurate” and “smears”. In the conclusion of his letter to Mr Sunak, Sir Laurie wrote: “Mr Zahawi’s conduct as a minister has fallen below the high standards that, as Prime Minister, you rightly expect from those who serve in your government.” Mr Zahawi yesterday faced calls to also stand down as an MP, but insisted he will stay on. When he became PM last October Mr Sunak promised to lead a government with “integrity, professionalism and accountability” at its heart. But he has since been plagued by ­scandals, including claims of bullying by ­ministers. He was also recently fined for not wearing a seatbelt.

Tory likens Rishi Sunak's Government to 'band on Titanic' in leaked WhatsApps,"Backbench Tory MP Lee Anderson ranted that any officials blocking Government efforts to stem the flow of small boat crossings may be guilty of 'treason' in a tranche of leaked messagesA Tory MP has compared Rishi Sunak's Government to the ""band on the Titanic"", according to a string of leaked WhatsApp messages. Backbencher Lee Anderson ranted that any officials blocking Government efforts to stem the flow of small boat crossings may be guilty of ""treason"" in WhatsApps obtained by Sky News. The tranche of messages from the right-wing Common Sense Group of Tories laid bare anger from MPs attacking civil servants and bemoaning Rishi Sunak's Government. Their anger appeared to have been triggered by a Sunday Express front page claiming civil servants are trying to ""scupper"" the Prime Minister's plans to tackle illegal migration. Mr Anderson said the Government's promised legislation would ""not stop the crossings"" - and the controversial plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda could happen ""if we had the balls"". After one MP said legislation is coming to tackle the issue, Dudley North MP Marco Longhi said: ""I don't want to shoot the messenger.   ""But we've had legislation before. ECHR (European Convention on Human Rights) trumps everything and our own colleagues want to keep it even if it poses a security risk to UK people as we've just seen.  ""We will be slaughtered at the locals and at the GE (general election).""  Mr Anderson reportedly replied: ""It's like the band on the Titanic. Playing the same tune and ignoring the obvious."" The MPs also hit out at civil servants accused of frustrating the Government's plans. Ipswich MP Tom Hunt said: ""All of the unelected civil servants who are attempting to block the democratically elected government should either be fired or named.  ""If they want to engage in politics and be a political actor they should either leave their profession and stand for office or get the scrutiny that comes with it.""  ""Going against the state is Treason. Surely,"" Mr Anderson said. Mid Derbyshire MP Pauline Latham was quoted as saying: ""I thought civil servants advise and ministers decide? Obviously no longer!"" She declined to comment when contacted by PA.  Wrexham MP Sarah Atherton said: ""I thought there was a process to sack them. Obviously no longer! They counter-argue with bullying claims.""  South Holland and The Deepings MP, Sir John Hayes, a close ally of Home Secretary Suella Braverman, said: ""They simply must be told! Please feed into your whips that this is the government's most urgent priority.  ""We must back Suella in this battle with out of touch, privileged, unelected pen pushers."" Mr Sunak is under intense pressure to crack down on illegal migration, with the surge in small boats crossings cited as a key issue on the doorstep by many Tory MPs. The PM has made it one of five key pledges in his New Year speech but the issue is likely to cause him headaches in the run up to the local elections in May. The Government's controversial scheme to ship migrants to Rwanda is tied up in the courts after a series of legal challenges on human rights grounds. The High Court granted some of the groups who lost the case the right to appeal earlier this month. No flights can take off until the legal wrangling is resolved.

Rishi Sunak axes 999 targets and is slammed for putting patients at risk,"Rishi Sunak is expected to make the announcement on Monday despite concerns from the Labour Party, which says patients will be ""left waiting longer than is safe"".Rishi Sunak has been accused of putting patients at risk as he waters down ambulance and A&E waiting targets. The Prime Minister will make the announcement today, amid the worst NHS crisis in its history. He will set a target of March next year for ambulances to get to sus­­pected heart attack, sepsis and stroke patients within 30 minutes, instead of the current 18-minute target. These patients waited an average of 93 minutes for paramedics last month. A&E departments will be told that by March 2024, 76% of patients should be seen within four hours. Hospitals are supposed to see 95% within this timeframe but this standard was last met in July 2015.

One in 10 Ministry of Justice staff say they have experienced bullying or harassment,"According to the annual Civil Service People Survey 11% of MoJ staff warned that they had experienced bullying, harassment or discrimination - significantly higher than an average across the Civil Service of 7%More than one in 10 officials at the Ministry of Justice say they have experienced bullying, harassment or discrimination.  The department is suffering an exodus of staff as a Whitehall probe investigates bullying claims against Justice Secretary Dominic Raab.  According to the annual Civil Service People Survey, 11% of MoJ staff warned that they had experienced bullying, harassment or discrimination - significantly higher than an average across the Civil Service of 7%. Staff turnover in the MoJ’s Whitehall headquarters has dramatically increased over the last year under Mr Raab’s leadership. According to an annual report by the department, 7.2% of staff have left the department and civil service in the years 2021/22, compared to only 4.6% in 2020/21. The Mirror revealed in November Mr Raab has been nicknamed “the Incinerator” because he “burns through” staff so quickly.   Officials working for him accused him of creating a “climate of fear” in the Ministry of Justice. Downing Street confirmed last month the Deputy Prime Minister was facing eight bullying complaints.  The Prime Minister has tasked lawyer Adam Tolley KC with looking into incidents during Mr Raab’s stints as Justice Secretary, foreign secretary and Brexit secretary.   Mr Raab was appointed Justice Secretary in September 2021. He was ousted from the department when Liz Truss became PM, but he returned just seven weeks later when Mr Sunak entered No10 last month.   Previous Labour analysis found that in the 12 months since Mr Raab’s appointment, 963 staff quit at the department’s HQ – up from 795 in 2021 and 610 two years before.  Mr Sunak came under pressure to sack Mr Raab last week when the Guardian revealed the bullying investigation was much bigger than expected, with at least two dozen complainants involved. When Mr Sunak became PM three months ago, he promised a government of ""integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level"", but repeated sleaze scandals have called this into question.  Shadow Justice Secretary Steve Reed, who uncovered the figures, said: “It is shocking to learn that staff are fleeing the bullying culture under Dominic Raab.  ""This Conservative Government has a shameful track record of brushing serious misconduct under the carpet. Their refusal to act on Priti Patel ’s bullying led their ethics chief to quit in disgust.   “Rishi Sunak promised integrity and accountability. His failure to suspend Raab while serious allegations of his bullying are investigated is yet more proof of the Prime Minister's weakness inside his own party. Labour has a plan to clean up politics through a fully independent Ethics and Integrity Commission.”  A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: “We have zero tolerance for bullying, harassment or discrimination and reports of this behaviour in MoJ and our agencies have fallen by around a third since 2010 as a result of our work to tackle it.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/one-10-ministry-justice-staff-29079413
Michael Gove admits 'faulty' Government guidance partly to blame for Grenfell tragedy,"The Housing Secretary's comments come over five years after the fire at the residential tower block in North Kensington, west London, in June 2017 killed 72 people and triggered a public inquiryMichael Gove has apologised to the families affected by the Grenfell tragedy after admitting the government was partly to blame.  The fire at the residential tower block in North Kensington, west London, in June 2017 killed 72 people and triggered a public inquiry.  Speaking almost six years on, the Housing Secretary told the Sunday Times the system of regulation at the time was ""faulty"". ""The Government did not think hard enough, or police effectively enough, the whole system of building safety,"" he said. ""Undoubtedly. ""I believe that (the guidance) was so faulty and ambiguous that it allowed unscrupulous people to exploit a broken system in a way that led to tragedy."" Speaking to Sky News's Sophy Ridge programme, the Cabinet minister added: ""Government - collectively - has to take some responsibility"". Read More
  Mr Gove will on Monday give a six-week deadline for developers to sign a Government contract to fix their unsafe towers - or be banned from the market. It will reportedly cover 1,500 tower blocks with a height of over 11metres. The Cabinet minister is expected to use the so-called ""responsible actor scheme"", to be established in the spring, to block such companies who refuse to sign up. Ahead of the announcement, Mr Gove told Sky News yesterday: ""I think that if you look at what happened to Grenfell, there were lots of factors but yes, the Government collectively has to take some responsibility… It is undeniably the case that the system of building regulation was not right,"" he told the programme. Asked if he would apologise, Mr Gove said he ""absolutely would"". He added: ""I remember visiting the site just a couple of days after the fire and thinking that it was horrific that this had happened. The more that I discovered about the circumstances the more horrified I was. ""There were people in that building who had warned beforehand that they were in potential danger. The warnings were not heeded. I'm the first, I hope, to acknowledge that we haven't done right by the bereaved and the residents and survivors from Grenfell and that is one very, very important mission.” Read More
 Speaking on Sunday Labour's Shadow Housing Secretary Lisa Nandy said her party would support ""any genuine action to fix unsafe properties"". She added: ""The principal of a responsible actor scheme that commits the industry to fixing unsafe properties is the right one. “However, the Secretary of State has claimed he’s being tough on this before. It has been one year since he last made this demand on developers. ""Five years after the Grenfell tragedy only seven per cent of flats at fire risk have been fixed, and millions are still left with unsellable properties and eye watering bills."" A public inquiry into the tragedy, chaired by Sir Martin Moore-Bick, is yet to deliver its final report. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/michael-gove-admits-faulty-government-29079157
Nadhim Zahawi's 'snivelling and graceless resignation letter shows his true character',"Rishi Sunak has finally sacked Nadhim Zahawi from the Cabinet amid a row over his tax affairs - The Mirror's Jason Beattie says it lacks any apology or contrition despite several ministerial code breachesIf you want to know Nadhim Zahawi’s true character look no further than his snivelling and graceless resignation letter. You can take your pick of which aspects of this parting shot were the most offensive. For some people it will be the complete absence of any apology or contrition for being a serial breaker of ministerial rules. Others will have noted his snide comments about the press who had the temerity to raise questions about his murky tax affairs. This is the defence used by Scooby Doo villains when they complain they would have got away it had it not been for those meddling kids. The former Cabinet minister gives the impression he is not sorry for his conduct, he’s only sorry his conduct was exposed by the media. Read More
  But the line which really sticks in the craw is Zahawi’s effusive praise for the “country I love.” In almost every media appearance Conservative ministers pose next to the Union flag to signal they are the true patriots. But real patriots do not set up offshore accounts in tax havens to stash their riches. Real patriots seek to pay their taxes in full and on time. And real patriots act with honour when they have broken the ministerial code by resigning with good grace. Zahawi has done us a favour by finally revealing the whole charade of the Tories’ plastic patriotism.

Nadhim Zahawi's SEVEN breaches of ministerial code in bombshell ethics investigation,"Rishi Sunak sacked the Tory Chairman Nadhim Zahawi on Sunday for 'serious' breaches of the ministerial code after his ethics investigator Sir Laurie Magnus's rapid report into the senior Tory MP's tax affairsRishi Sunak has sacked Tory Chairman Nadhim Zahawi for ""serious"" breaches of the ministerial code after the devastating findings of an ethics probe. It comes after days of damaging rows over the tax affairs of Mr Zahawi, who was appointed to the position at Tory HQ in October by the Prime Minister. The row surrounding Mr Zahawi centres on a settlement and penalty he paid to HMRC while he was Chancellor in the dying days of Boris Johnson's Government. It was only last weekend the Tory MP admitted publicly to paying a settlement with the tax office, saying he had made a ""careless"" error. The comments led Mr Sunak - who initially said Mr Zahawi addressed the matter in full - to order his ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus to investigate on Monday. In a little under a week, Sir Laurie reported back to the PM on Sunday with his findings setting out a series of failings by Mr Zahawi in an excruciating letter. Read More
  In response, Mr Sunak said there had been a ""serious breach"" of the ministerial code and sacked Mr Zahawi from the Government. In his own letter Mr Zahawi made no apology for his conduct or failings and instead criticised some of the media's reporting. Here The Mirror looks at the key points of Sir Laurie's letter - and seven breaches of the ministerial code. April 2021 Sir Laurie sets out Mr Zahawi's discussions with HMRC began in April 2021 and the then-vaccines minister attended a meeting in June 2021. The ethics adviser said the Tory MP claimed ""he had formed the impression that he and his advisers were merely being asked certain queries by HMRC concerning his tax affairs, and that this impression persisted"" until 15 July 2022 - 10 days after being appointed Chancellor. Read More
  Sir Laurie, however, insisted that Mr Zahawi should have understood he was ""under investigation by HMRC and that this was a serious matter"". The investigator says Mr Zahawi breached the ministerial code by failing to declare the HMRC probe. September 2021 Mr Zahawi was appointed Education Secretary and failed to declare HMRC's investigation into his tax affairs. Sir Laurie said: ""Despite the ministerial declaration of interests form including specific prompts on tax affairs and HMRC investigations and disputes - Mr Zahawi failed to meet the requirement (at paragraph 7.3 of the Ministerial Code) to declare any interests which might be thought to give rise to a conflict"".  5 July 2022  Mr Zahawi completed a declaration of interests form on 5 July after being appointed Chancellor by Boris Johnson.  It contained no reference to the HMRC investigation, Sir Laurie said. ""Only following receipt of HMRC’s letter received on 15th July 2022 (dated 13th July), did Mr Zahawi update his declaration of interests form to acknowledge that his tax affairs were under investigation, but he provided no further details other than the statement made previously that he was clarifying queries."" 10 July 2022 Mr Zahawi made a statement after media reports claiming stories about him were ""inaccurate, unfair and are clearly smears"". He said: “These smears have falsely claimed that the Serious Fraud Office, the National Crime Agency, and HMRC are looking into me. Let me be absolutely clear. I am not aware of this. I have not been told that this is the case. “I’ve always declared my financial interests and paid my taxes in the UK. If there are questions, of course, I will answer any questions HMRC has of me.” Read More
  The ethics investigator Sir Laurie says Mr Zahawi did not correct the record until January 2023, adding: ""I consider that this delay in correcting an untrue public statement is inconsistent with the requirement for openness."" August 2022 Mr Zahawi reached an initial agreement with HMRC in August 2022 and a final settlement the following month, including a penalty. In his withering letter, Sir Laurie added: ""The subsequent fact that the investigation concluded with a penalty in relation to the tax affairs of a Minister also requires declaration and discussion. ""It is a relevant interest which could give rise to a conflict, and particularly so in the case of HM Treasury Ministers and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has responsibility for the UK tax system. ""As a result of my inquiries, I conclude that Mr Zahawi failed to update his declaration of interest form appropriately after this settlement was agreed in principle in August 2022"". September 2022  After Liz Truss won the Tory leadership contest, Mr Zahawi was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster at the Cabinet Office.  ""Mr Zahawi failed to disclose relevant information - in this case the nature of the investigation and its outcome in a penalty - at the time of his appointment.""  October 2022  After Ms Truss's Government imploded, Mr Zahawi was appointed Tory Chairman and Minister without Portfolio by the new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.  Mr Zahawi again failed to disclose the nature of the probe or the penalty. In both the case of Ms Truss and Mr Sunak's Governments, Sir Laurie said: ""Without knowledge of that information, the Cabinet Office was not in a position to inform the appointing Prime Minister"".

'Britain must stand together to protect right to strike as Tories hellbent on attacks',"In an article for the Mirror, TUC general secretary Paul Nowak called on workers across the country to support its Protect the Right to Strike campaign day on WednesdayThe right to strike is a fundamental British freedom. Striking workers won us the 8-hour working day and equal pay for women. Even when workers do not go on strike, it gives them the power. The right to strike brings employers to the negotiating table. And it underpins thousands of successful pay negotiations every year. But the Conservative Party is hellbent on attacking the right to strike. The anti-strikes bill will mean that public service staff can be sacked for taking part in democratic strike action. That’s wrong, unworkable, and almost certainly illegal.  It will lead to lower pay across the economy and pay disputes that drag on for longer. Even the government admits this. Conservative ministers applauded public service staff during the pandemic. And they promised that key workers would be rewarded once it was over. But with this bill, they have gone from clapping to sacking. This attack comes not only in the middle of a cost of living crisis. It also follows a decade of pay cuts for nurses, teachers, firefighters and other public sector staff. But so far ministers have failed to table a fair deal on public sector pay. And this bill will make it much easier for them to refuse negotiations in the future.  If your job is not yet mentioned in the bill, don’t assume you are safe. Once it becomes law, it will be very easy for ministers to extend it to other workers too. We are calling on all workers to stand together on this. The right to strike must be protected – otherwise, no worker is safe. That is why on Wednesday we are campaigning across the nation to Protect the Right to Strike. Workers and their unions are holding rallies up and down the country. And I will visit Downing Street with key workers to call on the government to abandon their attack on working people. With your support too, we can all protect this British freedom – the right to strike for fair pay and conditions.  More information on the Protect the Right to Strike campaign can be found here.

One in six headteachers quit working in state schools after just five years,"The NAHT, which represents school leaders, warned of an exodus from the classrooms as headteachers quit their jobs and leave the state schools system altogether after just a few yearsAlmost one in six headteachers quit their jobs and leave the state schools system after just five years, shocking figures show. Teaching unions last night warned the government’s failure to pay staff properly was fuelling an exodus from the classrooms. Teachers who are members of the NEU will walk out on Wednesday on what is set to be the biggest day of strikes in a decade. Up to half-a-million public sectors are expected to take part in industrial action that will also involve train drivers, civil servants, university lecturers, bus drivers and security guards. The NAHT, which represents school leaders, today warns that many headteachers are leaving their jobs after a few years instead of remaining in post for decades as previously.   An analysis of Department for Education data found a quarter (25%) of heads resigned from their post within five years of being appointed. Almost two-thirds (64%) of those decided to leave the state schools system altogether. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT, said the figures showed “the very real consequences of the government’s driving down” of school pay over the last 10 years. ”The profession is haemorrhaging experienced and talented teachers and leaders who we desperately need, and we are losing them for good,” he warned. “These are leaders who are not at the end of their careers, who previously would have expected to continue leading their schools for decades more. “Instead, they are being forced out, and are finding jobs that pay and treat them better.” The NAHT, which is not currently part of the strike action, is set to reballot its members on taking industrial action.  Its members overwhelmingly backed walkouts in a previous vote, but they failed to reach the turnout threshold required. Last-ditch talks will be held today in a bid to resolve the teachers' pay dispute ahead of several weeks of walkouts by the NEU. Union leaders will meet Education Secretary Gillian Keegan after previous talks failed to break the deadlock. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: ""This is the last chance to avoid the strike on Wednesday… We hope the Secretary of State will bring forward concrete proposals to end this dispute and avert the strike action."" A source close to the Education Secretary said she will use the meeting to reiterate her call from the weekend for teachers to inform schools if they plan to strike. The source also said the Government will ""continue to be open and collaborative in meetings with the unions"". * Follow Mirror Politics on Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter and Facebook.

Boris Johnson becomes highest paid MP as he cashes in on his calamitous time as PM,"Boris Johnson accounted for more than a quarter of the outside earnings declared by MPs as he raked in a whopping £2.3million on top of his £84,000 Commons salaryBoris Johnson has become the highest-paid MP as he cashes in on his calamitous time as PM. MPs have declared £8.07million in outside earnings in the past year, including payments for second jobs, speeches, TV appearances and books. Mr Johnson accounted for more than a quarter of the total as he raked in £2.3million - on top of the £84,000 salary he receives as an MP. Almost all of that money has come in since Mr Johnson left Downing Street in September. It includes £1.8million in speaking fees and a £510,000 advance for his upcoming memoirs. News of Mr Johnson’s vast earnings comes days after it emerged that the taxpayer could end up spending more than £222,000 on legal fees defending the former prime minister from a Commons inquiry into whether he misled Parliament over partygate.   Mr Johnson’s income far outstripped his predecessor Theresa May, who declared £965,000 in speaking fees. Most of Mrs May's earnings are used to fund her private office and charitable work. Just three MPs - Mr Johnson, Mrs May and Sir Geoffrey Cox - accounted for half of declared outside earnings. The former attorney general earned £880,290 from his legal work. Sir Geoffrey was criticised in 2021 after it emerged he had used a proxy to vote in Parliament while working on a corruption inquiry in the British Virgin Islands.  Other high earners include Matt Hancock, who has declared £442,697 over the past year, including £320,000 from appearing on  I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here! Nine of the top 10 earners were Conservative MPs, with David Lammy the only Labour MP in the top 10, declaring £108,259. This included £48,908 in speaking fees and £53,500 for presenting shows on LBC. Some 39 MPs were paid more than the median UK salary of £31,000 in outside earnings alone, although 409 declared no outside earnings at all. * Follow Mirror Politics on Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter and Facebook.

'Rishi Sunak should call a general election - voters have lost faith in Tories',"The Tory party has seen no shortage of controversies since Rishi Sunak became PM last year - from accusations of bullying to suspensions - all despite his pledge to lead a sleaze-free governmentBack in October, in his first speech as PM on the steps of No10, Rishi Sunak pledged to lead a government with “integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level”. How’s that coming along, Prime Minister? Mr Sunak’s deputy, Dominic Raab, is facing multiple accusations of bullying. Tory chairman Nadhim Zahawi is in hot water because of back taxes. And Boris Johnson is in the spotlight again – this time over an £800,000 loan. Meanwhile, six Tory MPs have been suspended since the last election over allegations which put their integrity, professionalism or accountability into serious doubt. Today, we reveal how the Conservative Party’s chief treasurer, Mohamed Mansour, has made a mint from a business still supplying Russia’s oil and gas industry.   And how a barber lost his business after being hounded by Mr Zahawi’s family firm. It all adds up to a governing party giving every appearance of drowning in a cesspit of sleaze – run by those who think the rules the rest of us abide by do not apply to them. No wonder nearly 500,000 workers will walk out on Wednesday for the TUC’s day of action. The only response from Rishi Sunak to their pleas for fair pay are anti-strike laws, which are in breach of international human rights law and United Nations labour regulations. If the Prime Minister carries on at this rate, the UK will soon get the cold shoulder from the civilised world. The people who will strike on Wednesday are proud of their jobs serving the public.  They pay their taxes in full and on time and they are only walking out on the work they love because Mr Sunak will not even talk to them. We all have a right to expect those who govern us to do so with integrity, professionalism and accountability. But, as the polls consistently make clear, the voters have lost faith in the Tories being capable of any of that. If Rishi Sunak’s pledge to ensure his party cleans up its act was sincere, then he still has much scrub-a-dub-dubbing to do. And if he is too weak to get a grip, then the honourable course would be to wash his hands of the premiership. By calling a General Election.

Rishi Sunak's election guru once worked for team advising oligarch pal of Putin,"Tory election expert Isaac Levido had a job at lobbyists CT, which gave advice to Andrey Melnichenko, a billionaire who had his luxury yacht seized after being hit by sanctions over Ukraine invasion An aide to Rishi Sunak once worked for a firm which advised an oligarch who was later sanctioned after Russia invaded Ukraine.  Tory election guru Isaac Levido, who spoke at Mr Sunak’s Cabinet awayday on Thursday, used to work at lobbyists CT. At the time, the company advised billionaire Andrey Melnichenko, whose net worth is put at $11billion.  Melnichenko was among those at a Kremlin meeting with Vladimir Putin after Russia’s invasion. There is no suggestion Levido personally advised Melnichenko, whose €530million yacht was seized in Italy last March after he was sanctioned by the EU.  The EU said Melnichenko – who founded a fertiliser giant and coal firm – “belongs to the most influential circle of Russian businesspeople with close connections to the Russian government” and “is a member of the closest circle of Vladimir Putin”.   A CT document seen by the Sunday Mirror outlined how to handle criticism of Melnichenko. It highlighted his “charitable activity” and said his superyachts pioneer “new maritime design, pushing the boundaries of naval technology”. A CT spokesman said: “CT does not represent Andrey Melnichenko and has not done so for more than five years... as that document clearly evidences, that work had absolutely nothing to do with sanctions, matters of government policy nor geopolitical issues.” A spokesman for Melnichenko said: “CT Group was one of a number of companies asked to present ideas. That was the full extent of the connection.”  A Cabinet Office spokesman said: “All government employees are subject to vetting and all special advisers declare their interests.”  The Conservative Party said: “This government has been resolute in standing up to Russian aggression.”  Levido’s firm was contacted for comment.

Hospital outpatients could get one-hour's notice to fill cancelled appointments,"NHS trusts are set to trial new short-notice lists of people who live close to hospitals and can come in at the last moment when appointments are cancelled by other patientsHospital outpatients could get as little as an hour’s notice to fill a last minute cancelled appointment. Health Secretary Steve Barclay has asked NHS trusts to trial short notice lists for patients who live near hospitals and are able to drop everything. It is part of a major drive to cut 660,000 missed appointments each month. Hospitals have been told to send appointment reminders in good time, beef up booking processes and use video links for consultations when possible. Of 122million annual appointments, one in 15 patients cancel. NHS Elective Recovery director Sir James Mackey said: “This drive has the potential to make a huge difference. Short notice lists mean patients on standby can be ready to fill any empty appointment.”   Mr Barclay said: “This will reduce no-shows, fill last-minute cancellations and make it easier for patients to be assessed from the comfort of their home.” He spoke as Healthwatch England warned one in 10 patients will not go to appointments because of travel costs.

'Nadhim Zahawi's lack of an apology shows the arrogance of a wealthy Tory',"Rishi Sunak today sacked Conservative Party chair Nadhim Zahawi after weeks of revelations about his tax affairs but the 55-year-old MP is yet to apologiseZahawi in sorry state Snivelling Nadhim Zahawi’s lack of an apology for seven breaches of ministerial standards shows the arrogance of a wealthy Tory behaving as if rules and taxes are only for the little people. His self-pitying criticism of public interest journalism, which unmasked him over millions of pounds in unpaid tax, unintentionally showed why he is unfit for political office. Feeble Rishi Sunak should’ve sacked the Tory rogue two weeks ago. Graceless Zahawi and puny Sunak gave us none of the “integrity, professionalism and accountability” promised by the PM when he entered Downing Street. Zahawi owes the British people an apology. Sunak owes us an immediate General Election so we may decide who rules Britain.  Deadly delays The ambulance service is crashing backwards, an emblem of the mistreatment of our ailing National Health Service. Tories cannot blame strikers when the worried public knows that help is far too often a long wait away when dialling 999. Successive Conservative Governments are the ones to blame for shortages of crews and paramedics who work their socks off. Heart attack, stroke and burns victims, along with other urgent cases, deserve an ambulance within the 18-minute target.  Rishi Sunak cannot expect gratitude as he pats himself on the back for hoping  ambulances will arrive within 30 minutes this time next year, rather than the current 90.  People will still die needlessly, sent to an early grave by his Government’s neglect. Miracle task God moves in mysterious ways and the Archbishop of Canterbury is a good man. Yet healing the seismic Royal rift would be a miracle of Biblical proportions. Asking Justin Welby to broker a deal for Prince Harry to attend Daddy’s coronation this May, could make the five loaves and two fishes resemble a party trick.

Tory Treasurer hired by Sunak and Zahawi rakes it in from Russian oil industry,"Billionaire Mohamed Mansour is co-owner of a company with a subsidiary supplying machinery to Russia's oil and gas industry, despite sanctions imposed since Putin's Ukraine invasionThe Tories’ top treasurer has been raking it in from a firm still dealing with warmonger Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Billionaire Mohamed Mansour co-owns UK-based Unatrac and a subsidiary supplying machinery to Russia’s oil and gas industry. Unatrac has donated £600,000 to the Conservatives and Mr Mansour is said to have pledged £2million to the Tories himself.  He was appointed Senior Treasurer last month by PM Rishi Sunak and tax row party chairman Nadhim Zahawi.   Unatrac has made millions with its subsidiary Mantrac Vostok by supplying Caterpillar machinery to Russia – which has been under sanctions since invading Ukraine last year.  Prime Minister Mr Sunak said, while Chancellor last March: “I am urging firms to think very carefully about their investments in Russia and how they may aid the Putin regime.”    But in December, he and tax-row Tory chairman Nadhim Zahawi appointed Mr Mansour, who is reportedly worth £2.3billion, to the top post with the Tories. The job of Senior Treasurer is expected to involve a fundraising drive ahead of next year’s expected General Election.  Last night the party refused to comment or answer questions on the ongoing Russian business interests of their head fundraiser.  But Anneliese Dodds, Labour Party chair, said: “Rishi Sunak has appointed a person who has made millions from trading in Russia. This government is drowning in sleaze, making an absolute mockery of Sunak’s promise of professionalism, integrity and accountability at all levels.  “Once again Rishi Sunak is too weak to lead. Will he continue to accept donations from someone trading with Russia, or will he grow a backbone, stop taking the money and cut ties with this individual?”  Unatrac and sister firm Mantrac Vostok have a string of offices and warehouses throughout Russia, dealing in Caterpillar equipment for mining and energy production. On its website, Unatrac states that it operates in various African nations as well as Iraq and Russia. A spokesman said they had “scaled back” their Russia operation following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The Sunday Mirror found Unatrac’s website was offering machinery for sale and rent in Russia, which were still listed on its website last night. The two firms are part of Mansour Group, owned and controlled by Mr Mansour and his brothers Youssef and Yasseen. It had revenues of more than £6billion in 2021. Mr Mansour, who has both UK and Egyptian citizenship, served as a transport minister under the Hosni Mubarak regime. He resigned in 2009 following a train crash which killed at least 50 people and injured 30 more.  Mr Mansour’s Tory prospects were the subject of widespread speculation last year, with sources repeatedly denying he was in the frame for the job of Senior Treasurer. But it was eventually confirmed by Mr Sunak and fellow former Chancellor Mr Zahawi in December, during a private reception for donors at the National Army Museum in London. Since then, Mr Zahawi has faced questions and calls to stand down as Tory chairman over a £5million tax bill settlement with HMRC.  Latest figures show the Conservative Party accepted almost £49million in donations in the first three quarters of 2022.  Mr Mansour, 75, is a client of Hawthorn Communications, the PR firm co-owned by former Tory chairman Ben Elliot.  Mr Elliot’s other firm, posh concierge service Quintessentially, was forced to close its Russia office last March, amid “growing concern” about links between the Conservatives and Russian money. At the time, Mr Sunak addressed UK-Russia links, saying: said: “I welcome commitments already made by a number of firms to divest from Russian assets.” Mr Mansour’s firm made its first moves in the Russian market in 1996, launching an operation in Siberia. In a 2016 interview with Construction Week, he boasted that he had defied predictions that he would lose $5million a year in the deal. Sceptics had pointed to the fact that the industry used Russian and Chinese equipment, rather than the more expensive Caterpillar gear. But Mr Mansour told the trade paper: “Why did I say ‘Okay, we’ll do it’? Because they have 30% of the world’s gas reserves. The first year we started selling equipment and then we started making money. The potential is huge.”  Mantrac Vostok lists 15 offices and warehouses around the country on its website. In 2021, Unatrac’s export arm, which is based in the UK, had a turnover of £115million, according to their most recently published accounts. Of that figure, £98million was made in Africa, with the remaining £17.7million made in Iraq, Russia and the rest of the world. Mr Mansour’s historic business interests in Russia were first revealed by Private Eye magazine. In July, the UK extended sanctions on Russia to include “large earth-moving equipment used in the mining industry”. But a source said Unatrac was not selling machinery used in mining in Russia – in compliance with international sanctions. A spokesperson for Unatrac told the Sunday Mirror: “Since the invasion of Ukraine, Mantrac Vostok (a subsidiary of the Dubai company Unatrac Holding Limited) has scaled back its operations considerably and has been focused on fulfilling long standing commitments that pre-date February 2022. “The company operates in absolute accordance with all international (including UK, US and European) sanctions.” Conservative Campaign Headquarters had no comment.

'Sunak is failing to earn anyone's trust and can't end sleaze claims against Tories',"Columnist Keir Mudie says the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is looking increasingly weakened by scandals in his party, as former Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi faces growing criticism over his tax errorIn the past month, they reckon, internet searches for “reducing stress” have gone up by more than 200% and “is stress normal?” by more than 600%. I reckon the surge in demand could be from the Government’s new ethics adviser. I suppose it’s one of those jobs you can’t turn down. Like, they offer it to you and you can’t really say no. Decent money – but imagine the hours? Ethics adviser to this lot. They ­appointed Sir Laurie Magnus just before Christmas. After six months with no ethics adviser (however did they manage?). Ease yourself into it, Sir Laurie, get Christmas out of the way, get started properly in the New Year. Then... BANG. They really can’t help themselves can they? This time, Nadhim Zahawi. They are talking about the inquiry being done by the end of this week. It’s one of those rare moments where everyone thinks he’s toast.   It’s not even, necessarily, the tax stuff that’s the problem here. Although it is a massive problem. In case you missed it, when he was Chancellor – CHAN-CELLOR – Mr Zahawi says he made a “careless but not deliberate error” that led to a tax settlement of about £5million, including a significant fine. The boss of HMRC has said that you don’t get fined for errors but that’s by the by. The real problem is the handling of it, the optics. Mr Starmer took full advantage at Prime Minister’s Questions by asking whether Mr Sunak could take the tough decisions, or whether the job is too big for him. Not helpful. Mr Sunak is becoming increasingly framed by the opposition as a man who can’t control those around him. At Thursday’s Cabinet away-day – at Chequers – he had to sit down with his deputy, Dominic Raab, who has at least 24 people accusing him of bullying, as well as Mr Zahawi and his fiscal situation. Mr Sunak is said to be livid with his party chairman. Not livid enough to fire him. But livid nonetheless.  This lack of action is not a good look. Mr Sunak was supposed to be putting clear water between himself and the shenanigans of the last-but-one Prime Minister. Boris Johnson, incidentally, was ­back in the news himself this week for taking an £800,000 loan brokered by a man he later made chairman of the BBC. It’s all still messy, murky, business as usual. They were supposed to be ­rebooting things this time round. Like Mr Sunak said, his government “will have integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level”. Not looking like that though, is it? A gift to Labour and more strength to the line that the Government is ­completely out of control. And at the centre of it, a weaker and weaker looking Mr Sunak. “Trust is earned,” he says, “And I will earn yours.” Has he earned yours yet? No. Me neither.

Struggling tenants of Nadhim Zahawi's family firm 'lost businesses due to late rent',"A Birmingham small business owner was forced to shut down his barbershop after being hounded for unpaid rent money by embattled minister Nadhim Zahawi's family firmA barber said he was forced to liquidate his business after being hounded by under-fire minister Nadhim Zahawi’s family firm. Jafar Jahromi, 57, was among small businesses chased for unpaid rent during the pandemic by Zahawi and Zahawi Ltd. He said he paid rent on time for his salon, Ikon, at a Birmingham city centre complex the Zahawis bought for £12million in 2019 but fell behind when Covid hit. Mr Jahromi axed the business after being sent a court summons for £35,000 in unpaid rent. Tory party chairman Mr Zahawi, 55, who is being investigated by PM Rishi Sunak’s ethics adviser over his tax payments, co-founded Zahawi and Zahawi but stepped back when he became a minister in 2018 and transferred his 50% stake to his wife. Their two sons are directors.   Mr Jahromi said the family were “only interested in making money, even out of people when they can’t afford to pay”. He added: “At the time the Tory mantra was to look after small businesses so I thought they’d enable me to get back on my feet.” After receiving the summons Mr Jahromi said he offered £25,000 and asked for a rent cut until he could move out but was refused. Two other traders chased for rent are also no longer trading. One was dry cleaning firm owner Deborah Brown, 55, who says she could not pay £5,400 quarterly rent and was chased for £36,000.   Mr Zahawi, his wife and their companies have a £100million-plus portfolio. They own five homes.  David Hawkins of Sherwood Wheatley solicitors, who represents Zahawi and Zahawi Ltd, said the firm “made every effort to reach agreement and commenced proceedings against Mr Jahromi’s company only as a last resort”. He added: “Mr Jahromi put his company into liquidation leaving the debt due to my client unpaid. “Mr Zahawi left the company in 2018 and has no involvement.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/struggling-tenants-nadhim-zahawis-family-29076913
'Rishi Sunak is clearly out of his depth and couldn’t run a bath let alone Britain',"Rishi Sunak, who marks 100 days as Prime Minister this week, and ""unpopular"" Boris Johnson are proving why the ""Conservative Party’s unfit to govern,"" argues associate editor Kevin MaguireTotally useless and grotesquely incompetent, Rishi Sunak couldn’t run a bath let alone Britain. The pint-sized unelected Prime Minister is proving he’s not up to the big job before his 100th day in the post on Thursday. Even Tories are beginning to acknowledge that woeful dithering, shocking errors and appalling judgement reinforce Keir Starmer’s “hopelessly weak” jibe. Taxing questions are much wider than sacking the wretched, self-pitying Nadhim Zahawi a fortnight late. Sunak giving the less than truthful Tory chair a clean bill of health the week before last was a PM scandalously putting party before country. The wealthiest PM in history is a complete chancer and unctuous charlatan behind the smile and politeness.   Which is why screaming Zahawi following Cabinet tyrant Gavin Williamson out of the door doesn’t end of Sunak’s problems. Deputy PM Dominic Raab is accused like deposed Williamson of bullying while Sunak’s dirty deal to restore Suella Braverman as Home Secretary deserves to haunt him. None of the horrifying behaviour might matter when living standards are soaring, the economy’s booming, NHS prospering and everybody’s happily singing “Heigh-ho, it’s off to work we go”. But living standards are tanking at record rates, Britain teeters on the verge of recession, the NHS is on its knees and the Tories are blamed for strikes hitting public services. Oh, and the Conservatives are so far behind the opinion polls they are being lapped by Labour. Sunak’s clearly out of his depth and the next 100 days could be even worse instead of better. That he’s stalked by greedy, law-breaking and unpopular Boris Johnson is why voters will almost certainly pull the plug on the Tories at the next election. They’re proving why the party’s unfit to govern, Zahawi a symptom of a terminal affliction. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/rishi-sunak-clearly-out-depth-29081366
Rishi Sunak accused of 'boys club' cronyism amid Boris Johnson loan row,"BBC Chairman Richard Sharp, whose appointment is under investigation after it was claimed he helped Boris Johnson get an £800,000 line of credit, was Rishi Sunak's boss at Goldman Sachs, before being brought in to advise Rishi Sunak during Covid Rishi Sunak has failed to “stop the rot” in politics, Labour said, as the party sought to drag the Prime Minister to the row over Boris Johnson ’s crony loan.   Deputy leader Angela Rayner said the Prime Minister had “personally ensured close friends from his old boys’ club enjoy the ride and reap the benefits.”   It was claimed last week that BBC Chairman Richard Sharp had helped Mr Johnson secure an £800,000 line of credit shortly before he put him forward for the BBC job.  Mr Sharp has said there was no impropriety and that the selection process was done ""by the book"". Meanwhile, the Times published a letter apparently warning Boris Johnson to stop talking about his finances with Mr Sharp, just days before he was named BBC Chair. The letter, dated December 22, 2020, reads: ""Given the imminent announcement of Richard Sharp as the new BBC chair, it is important that you no longer ask his advice about your personal financial matters.""  Mr Sharp was previously Mr Sunak’s boss while both worked for Goldman Sachs. And after he was made Chancellor, Mr Sunak brought Mr Sharp to advise him on keeping the economy afloat during Covid.   His “surprise” appointment as BBC chair is now under investigation by William Shawcross, the Commissioner for Public Appointments. Mr Sunak has sought to distance himself from the row over the loan, saying Mr Sharp’s appointment was made by “one of my predecessors”.  The Mirror revealed this week that Mr Shawcross’ daughter, Eleanor, had donated £20,000 to Rishi Sunak ’s leadership campaign.  She was later hired by the Prime Minister to run the Number 10 Policy Unit.  But Ms Rayner said: “Far from putting a halt to the merry-go-round of Tory cronyism, Rishi Sunak has personally ensured close friends from his old boys’ club enjoy the ride and reap the benefits. “Richard Sharp rotated from being Rishi Sunak’s boss, to being his adviser in government, to being handed a seat at the top of the BBC. “Instead of stopping the rot, Rishi Sunak is letting it fester. Labour has a plan to clean up politics with a genuinely independent Integrity and Ethics Commission to restore standards in public life."" A Downing Street spokesperson declined to comment.

Tory chairman Nadhim Zahawi SACKED by Rishi Sunak after tax row,"The top minister had come under intense pressure after it emerged that he had settled a multimillion tax dispute with HMRC while he was Chancellor last summerTory Chairman Nadhim Zahawi has been SACKED for a ""serious breach"" of the ministerial code amid a major row over his tax affairs. The top minister had come under intense pressure after it emerged that he had settled a multi-million tax dispute - including a penalty - with HMRC while he was Chancellor last summer. In a letter to Mr Zahawi on Sunday, the Prime Minister said an ethics probe by his independent adviser had made it ""clear there has been a serious breach of the ministerial code"". Mr Sunak, who was branded ""weak"" for failing to sack the Tory Chairman last week, finally said he had made the decision to ""remove"" Mr Zahawi from the Government. Last week Mr Sunak attempted to defuse the sleaze row by ordering his ethics advisor Sir Laurie Magnus to launch a probe - only days after he told MPs that the matter had been resolved. Read More
  The report by Sir Laurie found that Mr Zahawi hid the fact that he was being investigated by HMRC over his taxes when he became Chancellor in July during the dying days of Boris Johnson's Government. Sir Laurie said he had not been open about it despite filling in a declaration of interests form that specifically asked about “tax affairs, HMRC investigations and disputes”. In August, Mr Zahawi agreed to pay a penalty to HMRC when the dispute was settled, but he again failed to declare this. Sir Laurie said he clearly should have done so as it could “give rise to a conflict… particularly [as he was] the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has responsibility for the UK tax system”. Mr Zahawi also failed to declare that he had paid a penalty to HMRC when he was given Cabinet jobs by both Liz Truss and Mr Sunak.  The ethics report also found Mr Zahawi had not told the truth when reports first emerged last July that he was being investigated by HMRC. The minister said a claim that “HMRC are looking into me” was a “smear”. Sir Laurie said this was an ""untrue public statement"" that he failed to correct without delay. In the conclusion of his letter to Mr Sunak, the ethics adviser wrote: “Mr Zahawi’s conduct as a Minister has fallen below the high standards that, as Prime Minister, you rightly expect from those who serve in your government.” In his response, Mr Zahawi made no apology or mention of the breaches of the ministerial code. Instead, he added: ""I am concerned, however, about the conduct from some of the fourth esate in recent weeks.  ""In a week when a Member of Parliament was physically assaulted, I fail to see how one headline on this issue 'The Noost Tightens' reflects legitimate scrutiny of public officials.  ""I am sorry to my fmily for the toll this has taken on them"". In response, the Liberal Democrats Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper said Mr Zahawi should stand down from Parliament. She said: “Given this was a serious breach of the ministerial code, Nadhim Zahawi must also do the right thing and resign as an MP.  ""He has shown he is unfit to serve in Cabinet and unfit to serve the people of Stratford-on-Avon.”   She added: “Rishi Sunak has finally acted after spending days defending the indefensible on Nadhim Zahawi. It should never have taken him this long to act. Sunak's first 100 days in office have been tarnished by endless Conservative sleaze and scandals. “Serious questions remain about what Sunak knew about Zahawi’s tax affairs when he appointed him. We need a proper independent inquiry to establish the facts and hold the Prime Minister to account."" The ex-Tory Cabinet minister Michael Portillo also told GB News that Mr Sunak's failure to sack Mr Zahawi earlier made him look ""weak"". He said: ""This thing has been in the headlines now for days and days and days and it's been doing terrible damage to the government.  ""And to him and to the party. I think he did have an opportunity to get rid of him earlier... It pains me to say this, but I think on the whole it makes Rishi look weak.  ""I think he must have been kicking himself all week that he decided to refer this to an investigation rather than going with a decision straight away."" Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said: “Nadhim Zahawi failed to pay the taxes he owed in this country and tried to silence those who spoke out about it.  ""Despite the writing on the wall, the Prime Minister showed himself to be too weak to act.  ""Rishi Sunak should have sacked Nadhim Zahawi a long time ago, just as he should have acted over Dominic Raab and Suella Braverman, but in his weakness he promoted them."" She went on: ""The reason this keeps happening is we have a Government whose only principle is party first, country second. The Tories are governing in their own interests, with a Prime Minister who is trying to manage his MPs, rather than govern in the national interest. It's vital that we now get answers to what Rishi Sunak knew and when did he know it. ""We need to see all the papers not just have the Prime Minister's role in this brushed under the carpet.""   Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove also said he was not aware of any other minister who will have to quit over wrongdoing, but that he cannot ""make windows into men's souls, or women's"". Speaking on the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme, he was asked if he could guarantee that no other Government minister is going to end up having to quit over any financial wrongdoing or issues with their tax affairs. Mr Gove said: ""To the best of my knowledge I can't think of anyone who would be in that position. I can't make windows into men's souls, or women's. I can't know that there isn't someone anywhere in politics or elsewhere who might not have, through inadvertence or a desire to cut corners, done something wrong. ""All I would say is that in a properly, what's the word, Christian sense, we should be ready to forgive as well as to judge."" Earlier No10 was forced to deny claims Mr Sunak was warned of the possible reputational risk to the Government over the appointment of Nadhim Zahawi. According to The Observer, Mr Sunak, who became Prime Minister in October after Liz Truss's Government imploded, was warned over Mr Zahawi's tax affairs. It was claimed Government officials gave Mr Sunak informal advice when he was drawing up his top team regarding the risks from an HMRC investigation. But a No10 spokesperson said: ""These claims are not true. The Prime Minister was not informed of these details, informally or otherwise.""

'Man of the people' Lee Anderson takes £15k donation from posh private members club,"The Ashfield MP sparked fury this week by claiming foodbank users squander their money on “fags and booze”‘Man of the people’ Lee Anderson took a £15,000 donation from one of Westminster’s poshest private members clubs, official documents reveal. The Ashfield MP sparked fury this week by claiming foodbank users squander their money on “fags and booze”.  And he came under fire after he used one of his staff members to make an argument that nurses should not be using foodbanks.  He posted a picture of his employee Katy, claiming she earned £30,000 a year and did not need to use a foodbank. But it can now be revealed he accepted a donation worth half his staffer’s annual salary from the exclusive Carlton Club.   Labour Party Chair Anneliese Dodds said: “Lee Anderson’s constituents will be surprised to hear about this big money donation. It seems like this self-styled ‘man of the people’ is no different from the countless other Conservative MPs happy to accept cash from a swanky members-only Mayfair club. He’s just as out of touch as they are.” The newly published register of Members’ Interests shows the club handed Mr Anderson a £15,000 donation for “local campaigning”. The club became infamous last year, after former whip Chris Pincher was accused of groping two men there in June.   Last month, the club unveiled a portrait of Boris Johnson, who stepped down as Prime Minister just days later after heavy criticism of his handling of the scandal.  In May the Sunday Mirror revealed Mr Anderson had bought a lavish, six-bedroom house just months before suggesting poor people struggle to afford food because they don't know how to cook or budget. Mr Anderson told the Sunday Mirror: “I am raising money through private donations to employ a member of staff for my campaign team.  “Obviously I am not able to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds as some Labour MPs do through unions but rest assured if and when I have enough money I will employ a local person and pay them a decent wage from my donations.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/man-people-lee-anderson-takes-29073912
NHS waiting list frustration leads to fewer donors for transplant patients,"Clinicians say potential donors and their families have become less inclined to offer organs while a record 7.2 million patients have treatment delayed. Transplant patients face dying before they can get vital organs because frustrations over NHS waiting lists mean fewer donors.  Clinicians say potential donors and their families have become less inclined to offer organs while a record 7.2 million patients have treatment delayed. The number of people waiting for a liver has gone up 50% since the pandemic while donors have dropped. Jayne Pilkington, 43, from Cumbria has been on the transplant list for12 months after being diagnosed with biliary cholangitis which means her immune system is attacking her liver. She said: “I’ve not been able to work for three years now and I don’t want to be like this forever. “I’m not going to die today, next week or next month which is good, but my quality of life will only get worse until I get the transplant.”   Leading London transplant specialist Professor DouglasThorburn, medical adviser to the British Liver Trust, said: “The national liver waiting list is the largest it has ever been and there has been a recent fall in consent rates for organ donation. “Factors impacting the consent rate may include the challenging journey through healthcare that families are reporting.” Vanessa Hebditch of the British Liver Trust added: “There is a desperate shortage of donors. Patients needlessly die whilst waiting on the transplant list.” The number of patients needing a new liver has gone up from 450 three years ago to 644 today but there are 100 fewer donors than in 2020. Another 5,145 people are waiting for kidneys, up 419 over the same period And overall last year there were 330 fewer donors than before the pandemic.  Since 2020 everyone is now considered a donor unless they opt out but families still have to give their consent before organs can be removed. Prof Thorburn is now urging ministers to launch a public awareness campaign to halt the slide and encourage families to agree to dead loved ones having organs removed. He added: “We know that families who agree to donation feel proud of their decision and that it can provide a source of comfort to know their relative saved and improved lives.  He added: “Some families who refused donation later regret their decision.” NHS Blood and Transplant said: “With more people currently waiting for a transplant, it is as important as ever to join the NHS Organ Donor Register and speak with friends and family.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/nhs-waiting-list-frustration-leads-29075331
'Tories are trashing the place as they know they only have a year or two left',"Mark Steel says Tories show incompetence across all departments - even a Tory Lord this week wrote an article suggesting students should have to take a ‘tolerance test’ before they graduateThey’ve given up now haven’t they? They know they’ve only got a year or two left so they’re trashing the place. Next week Nadhim Zahawi will be fined for breaking into a van and nicking all the tools. Then sending them to a lock-up garage in the Cayman Islands where it’s legal to sell knocked-off chisels because it’s outside international law. Nadhim will say it was an honest mistake and everyone does it so you can all sod off. Then it will emerge that Grant Shapps has been acting as a pimp in the doorway of the Department of Transport, pleading with passers-by: “Hey, come here, we give you good time. We got sexy civil servants.   “I give you nice office. This is why we can’t have talks with Mick Lynch, these rooms always busy, very popular.” One Tory Lord this week wrote an article suggesting students should have to take a ‘tolerance test’ before they graduate – and if they prove they’re not ‘woke’, they get a discount on their university fees. So they’ll come up with more ideas like this. Dominic Raab will propose you get 10% off your water bill if you’re sexually aroused by Suella Braverman. Jeremy Hunt will tell us that to combat woke culture, 30% of the marks for English literature degrees will be awarded for barbecuing a Walls pork sausage.  To address the shortage of beds in hospitals, all patients will be sent to Rwanda. The contract for providing morphine to the NHS will be awarded to James Cleverly’s furniture. He’ll say: “This is an honest contract that will benefit the public, as my sideboard has already achieved astonishing results in providing saline drips and this morning my settee bought three packets of Lemsip from Boots.” Rishi Sunak will announce that because the ‘woke brigade’ have bullied him about not wearing his seat belt, from now on he’ll fly round the House of Commons in his private jet.  MP Andrew Bridgen will be awarded a world record, for breaking 153 parliamentary rules in one morning, including the ban on big-game hunting in the House of Commons when he shoots a rhino and gets Jacob Rees-Mogg to film him stood over it during a debate on VAT reform. What’s most impressive about all the incompetence and chaos, is it’s linked across every department of the establishment. So we hear stories such as “it has emerged that the General Synod of the Church of England granted Boris Johnson permission to hold a sadomasochist evening in St Paul’s Cathedral.  “The Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police provided handcuffs, then the Admiral of the Royal Navy lent Mr Johnson a Trident nuclear submarine, so he could threaten anyone who claimed he’d been there. “And the Governor of the BBC gave him 50 quid in the afternoon, saying ‘go on, son, you enjoy yourself.” We can only guess what will be left when this lot finally leave us alone.

Wes Streeting plan to use private beds for NHS patients gets backing of Alan Milburn,"The shadow Health boss wants to buy excess capacity in the private sector to carry out 233,000 procedures a year to cut NHS waiting lists if Keir Starmer becomes PM Former Labour Health Secretary Alan Milburn will back Wes Streeting’s plan to use private hospitals for NHS patients on Sunday.   The shadow Health boss wants to buy excess capacity in the private sector to carry out 233,000 procedures a year to cut NHS waiting lists if Keir Starmer becomes PM.  Mr Milburn tells GBNews: “If I was in charge today, I’d ask the private sector hospital guys what capacity they’ve got that is spare. “And I’d offer to buy it.

Mr Streeting’s scheme would mean NHS paying private hospitals for both in and out patient appointments at the same rate it would cost the health service. Mr Milburn also said he’d step in and drive up pay for those in social care.  He added: “We pay them the minimum wage. You can get as much working in Tesco ’s.   “I’d introduce a proper living wage for social care people, and it would be higher than you could earn in Tesco’s to make social care competitive. “We’ve got more vacancies in social care than we’ve got doctors working in the NHS.

"'I hate to Pooh-Pooh Jeremy Hunt's Tiggerish optimism, but I'm more of an Eeyore'","Columnist Rachael Bletchly says Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's sudden reinvention as a full-on glass-half-full optimist bent on getting the economy bouncing like Tigger is a load of old PoohsticksOptimism is a personality trait I never really developed. I don’t know if I was born with an inherent tendency for gloominess or whether some early childhood experience set me on the path to pessimism. But by the time I was able to read Winnie-the-Pooh I was definitely a glass-half empty girl, convinced that the ever-ebullient Tigger would one day bounce himself right off the edge of a cliff. I preferred to take my life lessons from Eeyore who ­famously ­grumbled: “I never get my hopes up, so I never get let down.” And the dour donkey’s mantra has stood me in pretty good stead over the years. It infuriates my Pollyanna pals who believe that permanent positivity is what keeps the clouds away – sending good vibes out to the universe and harnessing the ­cosmic energy that comes back.  But perhaps it’s time I had a rethink – like the Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt. Because in the space of a few weeks the Tory government’s harbinger of doom has swapped the long face and constant neigh-saying for a bouncy, trouncy, flouncy, pouncy fun, fun, fun new outlook. He appears to have shoved a spring up his bottom and gone full Tigger.    Forget the misery and austerity of his autumn statement, it’s now time to shake off the “gloom” and “declinism”. We simply need to be more positive – a bit more OPTIMISTIC. Or, as his alter-ego would say: “Oh stop that gloomy roomynation, all you need’s a bit of Tiggerization!” In a surprisingly upbeat speech on Friday the Chancellor revealed a shiny new plan for economic growth and prosperity based on four Es. That’s Enterprise, Education, Employment and Everywhere.  And once he has got his strategy in place, he reckons Britain will be brighter than Hundred Acre Wood on a summer’s afternoon. Won’t that be lovely? No more rain clouds or blustery days. And no need to worry about all those other Es – such as Energy, Eating, Emergency care, the Environment, and Effluent in rivers giving Poohsticks a whole new meaning. But I guess we will just have to wait and see whether Jeremy Hunt can really earn his stripes and get the economy bouncing back. Or if he’ll prove us Eeyores were right all along. Don’t bother getting your hopes up. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/i-hate-pooh-pooh-jeremy-29075147

Tax chiefs admit providing misleading information in row over Nadhim Zahawi's taxes,"Pressure is mounting on Downing Street to order the former Chancellor to step aside while the investigation is ongoing Tax chiefs admitted they provided misleading information last year in the row over Nadhim Zahawi ’s tax affairs.  HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) wrongly said said no Government minister was under investigation, in response to an inquiry from the Financial Times. It comes after a difficult week for Downing Street, amid growing calls for the Tory chairman to stand aside while under investigation for settling a multimillion-pound tax dispute while he was Chancellor.  Mr Zahawi has authorised HMRC to discuss his settlement - estimated to be worth £4.8 million and include a penalty - with the ethics investigation ordered by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.  Pressure on ministers grew after HMRC boss Jim Harra told MPs there are ""no penalties for innocent errors in your tax affairs"". On Saturday, HMRC admitted that it had made mistakes in the handling of a freedom of information request centred on the tax affairs of ministers. The FT reported that in response to an inquiry by the paper last year, HMRC said that no minister was being investigated. But at the time, Mr Zahawi was the subject of a probe by tax officials.   The paper reported that a response to a freedom of information (FOI) request by tax lawyer Dan Neidle, who had been working to expose Mr Zahawi's tax affairs, was believed by HMRC staff to be incorrect after he was informed that it was a backbench Tory MP and not a minister who was under investigation. ""We acknowledge that the processing of this FOI request was subject to a series of administrative errors, which we very much regret. ""We corrected these errors as soon as they came to light and are confident that our most recent response to Mr Neidle was both accurate and in line with the Information Commissioner's Office guidance,"" a HMRC spokesperson said.  A Liberal Democrats source said that the party is planning a ""Shakespearean tragedy"" in Mr Zahawi's Stratford-on-Avon seat, with the constituency added to leader Sir Ed Davey's tour of England ahead of the local elections in May.    Both the Lib Dems and Labour have called on Mr Zahawi to stand aside, but those calls have been so far resisted by both the Tory chairman and the Prime Minister.  Speaking during a Cabinet away day at Chequers on Thursday, Mr Sunak told broadcasters: ""I'm not going to pre-judge the outcome of the investigation, it's important that the independent adviser is able to do his work. ""That's what he's currently doing, that's what I've asked him to do and I'll await the findings of that investigation."" A week ago, Mr Sunak told Prime Minister's Questions that Mr Zahawi had addressed the fiasco ""in full"". But he went on to launch an investigation by Sir Laurie Magnus, his independent adviser on ministers' interests, admitting there were ""questions that need answering"" after the penalty was revealed. Mr Sunak insisted that ""no issues were raised with me"" when he appointed Mr Zahawi to his current role, amid questions over his political judgment.

Nadine Dorries slapped down by watchdog for 'breaking ministerial code' with TV show,"The former Culture Secretary announced on Friday that she would be launching a chat show on Talk TV, to start in February - with Boris Johnson as her first guestNadine Dorries has been slapped down by Westminster’s revolving door watchdog over her forthcoming TV show.  The former Culture Secretary announced on Friday that she would be launching a chat show on Talk TV, to start in February - with Boris Johnson as her first guest.  But watchdog chair Lord Pickles was left fuming after she failed to seek advice from his body before taking the job. All former ministers are required to ask the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) before taking a new job within two years of leaving government. By failing to do so, Ms Dorries apparently broke the ministerial code. Jacob Rees-Mogg announced he would get his own show on GB News on the same day, but approached Acoba before the appointment was announced.  In response, Lord Pickles said the “risk you could be seen to have been offered this role as a reward for decisions made, or actions taken in office, was low.”   But he was told to be “careful not to offer any unfair insight as a result of your access to information and potential influence in government.” In a letter to Ms Dorries on Friday night, Lord Pickles wrote: “The government's Business Appointment Rules that an application is required for all outside roles. “As such, failing to seek and await advice are clear before the role was announced or taken up in this case is a breach of the government’s Rules and the requirements set out in the ministerial code.” He added that her rule-breaking would be reported to the Cabinet Office. Ms Dorries has landed in hot water over TV appearances before.  In 2013 she was stripped of the Tory whip after failing to inform party chiefs that she planned to jet off to Australia to take part in I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here, while the House of Commons was sitting. She was later readmitted to the party, before being elevated to the cabinet by Mr Johnson. Labour Party Chair Anneliese Dodds said: “Once again the Conservatives think the rules don’t apply to them.  “It’s no surprise that Rishi Sunak's MPs are looking for new jobs, but the least we could expect is for former ministers to follow the guidance around appointments.  “ Rishi Sunak has been too weak to deal with his MPs and ministers so far. Is he strong enough to take action against Nadine Dorries?  ""Labour has a plan to clean up politics with a genuinely independent Integrity and Ethics Commission to restore standards in public life."" To date, nobody has ever been sanctioned for breaking Acoba rules. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/nadine-dorries-slapped-down-watchdog-29073591
Ex-MP Keith Vaz rules out Parliament comeback saying 'that ship has sailed',"It came just weeks after the Commons Standards Committee recommended he should be handed a six-month suspension for causing ""significant damage"" to the reputation of the HouseDisgraced ex-Labour MP Keith Vaz has ruled out a comeback, standing again in his old Leicester East constituency. It follows speculation Mr Vaz could be eyeing up a return to Parliament, after the conviction of the seat's current MP, Claudia Webbe, for harassment. ""That ship has sailed,"" he told The Guardian.  Mr Vaz did not contest the 2019 general election, stepping down after 32 years as an MP.  It came just weeks after the Commons Standards Committee recommended he should be handed a six-month suspension for causing ""significant damage"" to the reputation of the House.   Mr Vaz was found to have expressed a willingness to purchase cocaine for others during an encounter with male prostitutes. In a message to The Guardian, the former chairman of the home affairs select committee denied any suggestion he would stand again in the seat, where he is said to retain support in certain quarters.  He told the newspaper in a text message: ""I am glad to say that ship has sailed - a few years ago.""  The paper reports that Labour last week introduced rules over the city's constituencies, giving the party's national body the power to choose council candidates rather than seeing the decision left to local members.

Our commitment to fighting all forms of hate and discrimination – never stops. ‘Never again’ – never stops. “It’s up to us – everyone here – to keep up the work of fighting antisemitism and changing our party.

Suella Braverman accused of 'dangerously flirting with ideologues' over Windrush,"Actor David Harewood today said the decision to drop three key reforms brought in following the Windrush scandal was 'awful', while Baroness Floella Benjamin said the move would cause 'even more pain and hurt'Suella Braverman has been accused of ""dangerously flirting with ideologues"" after her ""cruel"" decision to drop three key reforms brought in after the Windrush scandal. Today actor David Harewood branded the decision ""awful"", while Baroness Floella Benjamin, who chairs the Government's Windrush Commemoration Committee, warned the move will cause ""even more pain and hurt"". Ms Braverman axed pledges to establish a migrants' commissioner, increase powers of the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration and hold reconciliation events. Baroness Benjamin, the entertainer and Lib Dem peer, tweeted: ""I was proud to oversee the creation of the National Windrush Monument as it was a way of acknowledging some of the wrongs but the government going back on the Windrush Scandal recommendations is cruel and has created even more pain and hurt.""   And Birmingham-born actor Mr Harewood, whose screen credits include Homeland and Supergirl, told LBC: ""Personally I think it's awful. And I think we're dangerously flirting with ideologues right now, who have no compunction to bring people together.  ""They're just being defensive when it comes to collaborating, sharing and growing. If we're going to Brexit, and sort of break ourselves off from it, then let's all join in together and make a new identity.""  The actor, whose parents moved to the UK in 1957, continued: ""I think the likes of Suella, she's a gatekeeper. And once the establishment has someone who looks convenient, they are front and centre. ""Personally, I feel no affiliation with her whatsoever, I don't think her race... we have no similarities at all. ""But I think it's very convenient for the powers that be that she looks like that, she speaks like that. I think in her circles, I think she will probably do very, very well.""  The criticism came after Wendy Williams, the solicitor who carried out a Windrush inquiry, said she was ""disappointed"" by the move.  In 2020, then home secretary Priti Patel had originally accepted all 30 of the recommendations made by Ms Williams.  On Thursday, Ms Williams said she was ""disappointed"" Ms Braverman was dropping ""crucial external scrutiny measures"", particularly the migrants' commissioner. A commissioner would be responsible for speaking up for migrants and flagging systemic problems within the UK immigration system. Ms Braverman, in a written statement to the House of Commons, said external bodies were ""not the only source of scrutiny"" and that she would look to ""shift culture and subject ourselves to scrutiny"" rather than follow all the recommendations. The Windrush scandal emerged in 2018 when British citizens, mostly from the Caribbean, were wrongly detained, deported or threatened with deportation, despite having the right to live in Britain. Many lost homes and jobs, and were denied access to healthcare and benefits. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/suella-braverman-accused-dangerously-flirting-29069269
Rishi Sunak branded 'lightweight Thatcher tribute act' by veteran trade union boss,"Former TUC General Secretary John Monks told the Mirror there has been a dislike of trade unions within the Tories ever since Margaret Thatcher succeeded Ted Heath in 1975A veteran trade union leader has branded Rishi Sunak a “lightweight Thatcher tribute act”. Former TUC General Secretary John Monks has accused the Prime Minister of scapegoating key workers and threatening tighter shackles on unions to ban strikes. Mr Monks said: “There has been a visceral hatred of trade unions in the Tory Party since Thatcher succeeded Ted Heath.” The Labour peer spoke ahead of Wednesday’s mass strikes by train drivers, teachers, and others. They will be co-ordinated by the TUC over the Government’s move to sack strikers unless they obey orders to cross picket lines. Framed as a plan to maintain minimum services amid disputes, the move has even been condemned by Tory MPs.   Mr Monks, who saw ex-PM Margaret Thatcher impose law after law on unions, tore into Mr Sunak, who was helped by the TUC to devise the furlough scheme as Chancellor. Mr Monks said: “They’re reverting to the Thatcher playbook. Sunak should know better. He knows trade unions are constructive. “Rishi Sunak is a lightweight Thatcher tribute act. Attacking trade unions is now in the Tory DNA. “It never used to be in the era of Harold Mamillan and Ted Heath. I remember Heath coming to a TUC party when he retired and chatting to Jack Jones. “I don’t know if Sunak is doing this because he really believes it or is doing it as a populist, enthusing the worst Tories.  “A PM looking for answers and working in the national interest would display genuine leadership. “They’d sit down with the representatives of workers with genuine concerns and work for a solution. “It’s telling the Tories and the PM aren’t doing that, particularly in the NHS.” Monks said inflation at 10.5% was hitting hardest key workers clapped by Conservatives during the pandemic. Public sector wages are rising just over 3% which is less than half increases averaging a little over 7% in the private sector though both are falling in real terms. “The enemies for the Conservatives are people trying to protect their living standards,” said Monks. “Passing a law to sack workers they clapped a few years ago isn’t fair, decent or democratic.” British workers suffer the weakest employment protection in any major European economy and trade unions are the most restricted.  The fire-and-rehire British system keeps earnings down and fuels job insecurity, gifting power to employers. “The Conservatives want to make sure nobody can strike,” said Monks. “Sunak is very much a Thatcher clone but banning people striking won’t work because it won’t address genuine grievances. “Using legislation time after time has failed, as we see with these strikes, when workers have legitimate complaints – in this case pay. “Trying to finish what Thatcher started is a sign of weakness. Public support for many of the strikes confirms the Tories are on the wrong side of these disputes.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/rishi-sunak-branded-lightweight-thatcher-29071141
King Charles wants to honour nuclear test heroes but medals are being delayed by MoD red tape,"King Charles wants Britain's nuclear test heroes honoured before his coronation, but the MoD is accused of creating ""unreasonable delay""King Charles wants to give a medal to Britain’s nuclear test heroes within months - but Ministry of Defence red tape could hold up the process for at least a year. The King has told friends he has pencilled in a full “investiture” type ceremony in April, before his coronation. But two months after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a gong for victims of the Cold War radiation experiments, civil servants say it will take more than a year for the design of the medal to be signed off. Alan Owen, whose dad died after witnessing 24 bombs in 78 days, said: ““It beggars belief that this country can organise a coronation in 8 months but we’ve been told it will take even longer to do one, simple, medal. “It took them 70 years to get around to asking the monarch for what we should have had on day one. They know how to make medals, this is just another unreasonable delay by the MoD so that there are as few veterans as possible left to collect it.”   A source close to the King said: “His Majesty is taking a close interest in the issue of nuclear test veterans, and wants to see some form of official ceremony as soon as possible. “He recognises that those who can be given it are not going to be around for long. “His staff have pencilled in something for April, depending on approval from government.” Britain exploded dozens of nukes and nearly 600 radioactive blasts in America, Australia and the South Pacific, between 1952 and 1991. Servicemen were left with a legacy of rare cancers, miscarriages for their wives, and 10 times the normal rate of birth defects in their children.  Surviving veterans have an average age of 85 - some are in their 90s.  The Mirror has campaigned for official recognition on their behalf for 40 years, and last year saw the first sign of change when the PM finally asked the King to approve a medal. Cabinet Office staff have told campaigners that “the usual process” for medal design and delivery is handled by the MoD medal office according to “set procedures”.  It is understood they are still working out criteria, with no date for inviting applications, or for it to be made by the Royal Mint.  Mr Sunak also promised a face-to-face meeting with veterans to discuss war pension reform, education packages, and missing records on nuked blood. Despite No10 acknowledging the request, no date has been set. Campaigners have also been promised meetings with Office of Veterans Affairs staff to discuss grant applications to a £200,000 fund, but none have been arranged. Labour's Rebecca Long-Bailey, who campaigns for the veterans, said: ""When he announced the medals, the PM witnessed their decades of pain and grief. The families wept as he promised them a meeting. They are still waiting, and time is running out. I urge the PM to meet us as soon as he can."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/king-charles-honour-nuclear-test-29070465
More than a dozen WWII-era ambulance stations still used by NHS,"The figures on old ambulance stations were revealed in a parliamentary question by Lib Dem health spokeswoman Daisy Cooper, who said: 'Across England too many NHS buildings are life-expired or crumbling'More than a dozen WWII-era ambulance stations are still in use in the NHS today. Official figures show there are 15 publicly funded ambulance stations built prior to 1948 - the year the health service was founded. Health unions say many ambulance stations in general have “fallen into a terrible state of disrepair” after suffering years of underfunding. Ambulance workers are forced to get ready, have their meals and take their breaks in bases that could have mould, leaking roofs and freezing temperatures. It comes as more than 10,000 ambulance staff prepare to join nurses in co-ordinated walkouts on February 6, in one of the biggest strikes in NHS history. They are striking over working conditions as well as pay.   Alan Lofthouse, 46, a former paramedic who worked in the ambulance service for 10 years, said his station was built in the 1960s and had “problems like asbestos”. “In these old buildings, when you're trying to rest on nights, you'd be next to a window, a single pane window, and you could feel the air coming through the holes and the rotten frames,” he said. “In every ambulance station you've got a store room that's full of either the drugs that ambulance staff give or the medical equipment they need in an emergency and all of those things need storing. With our old store rooms, it was difficult to keep things dry.” He added: “I can imagine there's a lot of these old buildings that are not in the best of repair. I can't imagine the Tories have been funding lots of investment in buildings when they haven't been investing in staff. I just can't see that being a sort of feasibility.”  Head of health Sara Gorton at trade union Unison said: ""Without proper funding, buildings have fallen into a terrible state of disrepair and there's too few staff to meet growing demands.” She added: “The dilapidated state of many ambulance stations is a clear sign of 12 years of government neglect.” Rachel Harrison, GMB National Secretary, said: “People know ambulance workers are underpaid and face unbearable workloads, devastating delays and chronic underfunding. “In addition many ambulance stations simply aren’t fit for purpose. “In some trusts, creaking stations are more than 50 years old, often repurposed military buildings or shared spaces with other emergency services.  “Meanwhile other trusts have sold the family silver and now lease new buildings with no strategic placement. They put cost before what we actually need. “It can mean ambulance workers have to drive miles to start their shift then drive the ambulance back into town for their first patient. It makes no sense and has a huge impact on response times. “Ambulance workers and the stations - like the rest of the health service - are close to collapse after more than a decade of Conservative cuts.” The figures on old ambulance stations were revealed in a parliamentary question by Lib Dem health spokeswoman Daisy Cooper. Ms Cooper said: “The Conservative Government has starved our treasured NHS of funding for far too long. ""Across England too many NHS buildings are life-expired or crumbling. “Hardworking paramedics and nurses are this country's heroes but they are faced with hostile Conservative Ministers who can't properly fund their work. With ambulance waiting times already at dangerous levels the Government must invest in our emergency health services including an urgent recruitment drive.

Figures show UK £60bn worse off than other countries as Jeremy Hunt lays out growth plan,"The dismal analysis came as Chancellor Jeremy Hunt gave a speech laying out the government's plans for investment and growth Lost growth under the Tories has left the economy £2,000 worse off per household compared to other G7 countries, Labour figures reveal.   The dismal analysis came as Chancellor Jeremy Hunt gave a speech laying out the government's plans for investment and growth.   But Labour's shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said Britain's potential had been ""held back by 13 years of Tory economic failure.""  She said: ""Labour will stop us going down this path of managed decline. Built on the rock of economic responsibility, our Green Prosperity Plan and mission to make Britain the best place to start and grow a business will get our economy growing and lift living standards.” Analysis found the UK economy was £60 billion smaller compared to the average of G7 nations. It's based on House of Commons Library figures which show the economy was 0.8% smaller in the third quarter of last year than in the fourth quarter of 2019. Over the same period, the average G7 economy increased by 1.9%. That means the UK economy is 3% smaller than if it had grown at the same rate as the rest of the G7.   Speaking at Bloomberg this morning, Mr Hunt admitted the public sector has rebounded more slowly from the pandemic than he wanted, but hit out at ""declinism"". Speaking at an event hosted by Bloomberg, he said: ""Declinism about Britain is just wrong. It's always been wrong in the past, and it's wrong today. ""Some of the gloom is based on statistics that don't reflect the whole picture. Like every G7 country, our growth was slower in the years after the financial crisis than before it. ""But since 2010, the UK has grown faster than France, Japan and Italy. Not at the bottom, but right in the middle of the pack.""   He added: ""Since the Brexit referendum, we've grown at about the same rate as Germany. Yes, we've not returned to pre-pandemic employment or output levels, but an economy that contracted 20% in a pandemic, still has nearly the lowest unemployment for half a century.  ""Whilst our public sector continues to recover more slowly than we would like from the pandemic strengthening the case for reform, our private sector has grown seven and a half percent in the last year.""

Police experience lost after Tory cuts will take years to replace amid vetting fears,"By next year it is estimated that 38% of officers in England and Wales will have less than five years' experience - more than three times higher than a decade earlier.Police experience lost due to Tory austerity will take years to replace, a senior Labour MP has warned - after a watchdog chief said it is impacting investigations. By next year it is estimated that 38% of officers in England and Wales will have less than five years' experience - more than three times higher than a decade earlier. Dame Diana Johnson, who chairs Parliament's Home Affairs committee, said that while the government has ""finally"" taken action to recruit new officers, she has concerns about how forces will handle a huge influx of staff. It comes after the Chief Inspector of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue, Andy Cooke, last week told MPs that there are ""significant issues"" around police ""tradecraft, experience and professionalism"". Just 5.5% of reported crimes result in a suspect being charged, latest Home Office figures show, down from 14% in 2015. Dame Diana told The Mirror: “From 2010 police numbers fell by over 20,000. The Government has finally taken action to reverse this trend and restore the number of officers to what it was a decade ago.    ""It will take far longer to replace the years of experience that has been lost."" The government claims it is on target to meet its election promise of recruiting 20,000 new officers by the end of next month - but latest figures show it would need to bring on over 1.110 a month - raising issues about vetting. Dame Diana said: ""Given the serious concerns about the long-term ability of police forces to ensure officers meet the standards of professionalism expected of them, we must also question how able it is to handle such a high influx of new staff."" Referencing the cases of rapist copper David Carrick and evil killer Wayne Couzens, she said it would be a ""mistake"" to solely focus on new recruits, saying: ""Many of the officers being found guilty of serious criminality, and that continue to damage public confidence in the service, have had long careers in the police."" Mr Cooke, a former Chief Constable of Merseyside Police, told cross-party MPs last week: ""What can't be denied is that irrespective of what the offence is, that charge rate is too low.""  The Commissioner continued that there are ""numerous issues"", stating: ""One is a shortage of detectives, secondly there's a very inexperienced workforce and inexperienced supervision."" He continued: ""The experience isn't as it was 10 years ago. There are significant issues around policing tradecraft, experience and professionalism."" ""Policing is at a very difficult time, some would say crisis in relation to its ability to ensure that the public is kept as safe as we'd like them to be."" Asked why police forces are struggling with experience, Mr Cooke responded: ""The 2010 austerity and the significant reduction in offer numbers."" A House of Commons Library research paper published last month states that in 2010 there were 172,000 police officers across the UK, including Scotland and Northern Ireland. This steadily dipped over the next decade, reaching 150,000 in 2017 before slowly starting to rise. By last year there were 164,000. The commissioner continued: ""Now trying to get back to these police officer numbers is an issue. ""I'd add on top of that that police officers in real terms have basically had a 20% pay cut in 2010 compared to what they earn now. ""So policing isn't a vastly attractive proposition, particularly in areas where there's a high cost of living."" Dame Diana said that this needs to be addressed. She said: ""We will only get the quality of officers we need if they see it as a viable, long-term career, where they can learn and develop.  ""Remuneration is an important part of this, but the wider culture must also change if we are to have a high-quality force that sustains the confidence of the communities it serves."" An inquiry into the future of policing, focusing on how forces can adapt, has been launched. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/police-experience-lost-after-tory-29010380
Boris Johnson's biggest fan Nadine Dorries to interview him on her new TV show,"The shamed former Prime Minister, who was booted out of office last year after a rebellion by his own MPs, will be the first guest on new show Friday Night With Nadine, TalkTV has announced Nadine Dorries has been given her own Friday night talk show - and will interview former boss Boris Johnson after incessantly calling for his return. The shamed former Prime Minister, who was booted out of office last year after a rebellion by his own MPs, will be the first guest on new show Friday Night With Nadine, TalkTV has announced. The chat will be aired on February 3.  Ms Dorries, who served as culture secretary between 2021 and last year, is Mr Johnson's most steadfast ally - this month claiming Tories should bring him back 'or die '.  Other presenters on the network include Piers Morgan, Jeremy Kyle, Vanessa Feltz and Sharon Osbourne.   It is unlikely the controversial MP will ask searching questions of Mr Johnson, having described him as a ""political rock star"". She refused to turn on him after he became mired in a number of scandals, and repeatedly claimed he had been stabbed in the back as his party turned on him. In a bitter attack on current PM Rishi Sunak a fortnight ago, she said: ""With Rishi in No10, we are heading into the long, cold and brutal wasteland of thankless opposition"". In a Mail on Sunday column she added: ""For the Conservatives, it's bring back Boris or die because the first task of any Labour government would be to ensure that there'll never be a majority Conservative government ever again."" Mr Johnson has been busy since leaving office, with a register of interests released last night revealing he's already banked more than £500,000 for a memoir about his disastrous time in Downing Street. He trousered an astonishing £276,130 for a single speech for a speech in Colorado Springs in October - while the Commons was in session 5,000 miles away. The update to the register also shows Mr Johnson received over £200,000 for a speaking engagement in December and £3,000 from the Spectator magazine. It comes as taxpayers are expected to foot a £220,000 bill for the former Prime Minister's legal defence against allegations he misled Parliament over Partygate.  Talking about her upcoming show, Ms Dorries said: ""As someone who's never been afraid to speak their mind, I'm delighted to be joining the team at TalkTV for Friday Night with Nadine, where I'll be putting my 23-year political career and experiences at the despatch box to good use. ""Boris Johnson continues to dominate so much of the political narrative since his departure from No 10. Now's the time to find out what he really thinks about a whole range of pressing issues."" TalkTV described her upcoming show as ""an irreverent look at the week's news and a lively mix of topical chat with guests from the world of politics, culture and sport"". In October she briefly stood in for Morgan on his Uncensored show while the former Good Morning Britain presenter was on holiday. Richard Wallace, head of TV, News Broadcasting, said: ""Nadine has a unique voice in British politics and will bring that unique voice to our air. ""She has had a seat at the top table of British politics during extraordinary times; knows all the key players and has true insight into how the corridors of power actually work. ""And, as a former nurse, she's one of very few politicians to have held down a proper job and worried about paying the bills, so our audience will relish her take."" It comes after fellow Tory MP and Johnson supporter Jacob Rees-Mogg announced he was joining GB News to host his own show. Friday Night with Nadine starts on February 3 on TalkTV from 8pm.

Jeremy Hunt bizarrely twice refuses to say if he's paid a tax fine before changing mind,"The Chancellor claimed that people at home were not 'remotely interested in personal tax affairs' after delivering a speech on the government's economic priorities Jeremy Hunt bizarrely TWICE refused to say if he has ever paid a penalty to HMRC - and claimed the public is not interested. But moments later he had a change of heart, saying that as Chancellor he should be clear, and said he had never been fined. Mr Hunt, after delivering a speech on the government's economic plans in central London, emphatically told journalists he wouldn't be commenting on his personal tax affairs. But he backtracked on this minutes later when interviewed on camera by the BBC. It comes as pressure mounts on Rishi Sunak to remove Tory chairman Nadhim Zahawi after it emerged he'd paid a penalty last year. The Treasury chief, who became Chancellor following the sacking of Kwasi Kwarteng in October, was twice asked by journalists today whether he has ever paid a penalty. In answer to the first question he responded: ""I'm not going to talk about my personal tax affairs, but I don't think there's anything interesting you'd find to write about."" Pressed a second time, he said: ""I don't think people at home are remotely interested in personal tax affairs.""   He quickly U-turned, however, telling the BBC: “Well, there's an independent process going on looking at Nadhim Zahawi and it wouldn't be right for me to comment on that. I don't normally comment about my own tax records, but I am Chancellor, so for the record, I haven't paid an HMRC fine.” The millionaire Chancellor has previously apologised for failing to declare his purchase of seven luxury flats to rent out - blaming an ""administrative error"". He was also reported to have legally avoided paying £100,000 in taxes following a £1.8 million property deal before the 2010 election, as it was completed shortly before a rise in dividends tax. It comes as pressure mounts on Rishi Sunak to remove Mr Zahawi, who said a ""careless but not deliberate"" error had been made relating to shares in YouGov, the polling company he co-founded. In a statement at the weekend, he confirmed he had agreed to a settlement - estimated to be worth around £5million, including a penalty - while he was Chancellor in the dying days of Boris Johnson's Government. Last night former Tory chairman Jake Berry said it was ""unsustainable"" for a minister to stay in post while being investigated.  Mr Hunt had earlier delivered a speech in which he promised to create ""mini-Canary Wharfs"" across the UK and called for more optimism about the state of the economy. He blamed ""black swan events"" - a financial crisis, the pandemic and the energy crisis - for the country's financial woes, and admitted a number of ""structural issues"" are holding the UK back. These include poor productivity, skills gaps, the ""overconcentration"" of wealth in the South East, and said real income hadn't risen as fast as it should. But he called for ""optimism"", saying the UK is ranked by the World Bank as one of the best locations to do businesses. Labour figures earlier showed that lost growth under the Tories has left the economy £2,000 worse off per household compared to other G7 countries. Mr Hunt told an audience in London: “Like every G7 country, our growth was slower in the years after the financial crisis than the years before it.  ""But since 2010, the UK has grown faster than France, Japan and Italy. Since the Brexit referendum, we have grown at about the same rate as Germany. “If we look further ahead, the case for declinism becomes weaker still. The UK is poised to play a leading role in Europe and across the world in the growth sectors which will define this century.” He outlined hopes of bringing millions of people back into work, describing an ""enormous and shocking waste of talent and potential"".  Mr Hunt continued: ""So to those who retired early after the pandemic or haven’t found the right role after furlough, I say: ‘Britain needs you’ and we will look at the conditions necessary to make work worth your while."" Rachel Reeves MP, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor, responded: “Britain has so much potential. ""From creating good, new jobs in the industries of the future, to making our country the best place to start and grow a business, Labour’s proper plan for growth will grasp those opportunities and make our economy stronger to face up to the challenges. “13 years of Tory economic failure have left living standards and growth on the floor, crashed our economy, and driven up mortgages and bills. “The Tories have no plan for now, and no plan for the future. It’s time for a Labour government that will build a better Britain.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/jeremy-hunt-bizarrely-twice-refuses-29064180
Jeremy Hunt says HS2 WILL go to central London after confusing Government messaging,"The Chancellor has said he does not see any ""conceivable circumstance"" in which HS2 would not end in central London - after reports suggested the plan could be scrappedHS2 WILL go all the way to Euston, the Chancellor has said - amid confusion over whether parts of the project had been scrapped. Jeremy Hunt has said he does not see any ""conceivable circumstance"" in which HS2 would not end in central London as originally planned. It comes after reports emerged overnight claiming that the controversial line might not go actually go into the heart of the capital. The reports - which the government did not initially deny - sparked anger, with Camden Council saying HS2 had left a ""deep scar"" on communities. Mr Hunt told the BBC: “I don't see any conceivable circumstance in which that would not end up at Euston and indeed, I prioritised HS2 in the autumn statement. ""We have not got a good record in this country of delivering complex, expensive infrastructure quickly. ""But I'm incredibly proud that for the first time in this last decade, under a Conservative government, we have shovels in the ground. We are building HS2 and we're gonna make it happen.”   It comes after the Tory Government last night refused to deny reports that the multi-billion flagship HS2 project linking the North and the Midlands to the capital may never actually reach central London anymore.  The shambolic project has been blighted by soaring inflation and rising construction costs and bosses are said to be considering scaling it back. It was reported the central Euston terminus could be delayed to 2038 or scrapped altogether, meaning one of the key promises of the flagship scheme may never be met. Its construction caused major upheaval across England, knocking down homes, schools and businesses and removing green spaces.  Work has already begun at Birmingham's Curzon Street station in the city centre - but it is reported a two to five-year delay to the entire project is now being considered.  The new plans discuss high-speed trains running from the suburb of Old Oak Common in West London rather than Euston to save money.   This would mean that commuters will have to actually use the new Elizabeth line to complete their journeys into central London. And it has sparked fears that Birmingham to Crewe and Manchester's legs of the plan will also be scrapped entirely.  One ex-HS2 employee told The Sun : “There are a number of options for getting the costs down and none of them is very nice.  “Either you scrap Euston, or you have to slow down the whole project and hope inflation comes down.” Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh said: “It is utter absurd that the Chancellor has been forced to deny that HS2 may not even reach London. “A lost decade of dismal Conservative failure has left the country with second-rate infrastructure, and rail services in crisis, holding the economy back and disrupting passengers. “Labour will call time on this decade of Tory decline, and deliver the infrastructure fit for the century ahead, unlocking growth, jobs and investment.” Councillor Georgia Gould, Leader of Camden Council, said: “These reports represent more unacceptable uncertainty to a project which has already knocked down 200 homes in Camden and razed sections of our borough to the ground. “HS2 construction has left a deep scar in our communities - our residents have had their homes knocked down, their school and businesses’ have been demolished and their green space has been removed. “Our residents will fear that they will have to endure years of disruption for absolutely no benefit at the end of it. They must see the new homes, green spaces and opportunities they were promised - HS2 must not walk away and abandon our communities.”  Follow Mirror Politics on    Snapchat   ,    Tiktok   ,    Twitter   and    Facebook   .

MP demands Tory Jonanthan Gullis makes public apology for 'fanning hatred',"Jonathan Gullis sparked outrage when he heckled a Labour MP asking about the disappearance of migrant children from Home Office-run hotels - saying they 'shouldn't have come here illegally'A Tory MP faces calls to publicly apologise after saying migrant children snatched by criminal gangs ""shouldn't have come here illegally"".  Jonathan Gullis sparked outrage when he heckled a Labour MP asking about the scandal - which has seen the Home Office admit 200 children are unaccounted for.   Labour's Mary Kelly Foy has written to Conservative chairman Nadhim Zahawi accusing Mr Gullis of fanning hatred, and demanded that he is made to say sorry.   She wrote: ""For him to fan the fire of hate toward vulnerable children who have fled to our country seeking sanctuary, while escaping the atrocities taking place in their own, shows nothing but ignorance and contempt.""  In her letter she told Mr Zahawi - who is himself facing calls to step down after it emerged he paid a penalty to HMRC last year - that Mr Gullis's actions has further damaged the reputation of the Tory Party. Ms Foy wrote: ""Mr Gullis' views are not appropriate for a public servant. It is even more inappropriate to voice such views on a stage which is broadcast so widely.   ""Members of Parliament are in positions of power whereby they can influence the thoughts and feelings of others through their words - and we have a responsibility to use that influence cautiously, so the repercussions of our words does not have a detrimental impact on anyone, let alone vulnerable groups."" She told Mr Zahawi that if he felt Mr Gullis would benefit from a ""candid conversation"" with an organisation that helps asylum seekers, she would offer her help setting it up. Former Schools Minister Mr Gullis was yesterday branded a ""pound shop Farage"" and accused of using ""dehumanising language toward asylum seekers"". He has been widely condemned on social media after Shadow Northern Ireland secretary Peter Kyle shared the comment, which was shouted as Labour's Tulip Siddiq questioned Rishi Sunak. Mr Kyle posted on Twitter: ""Tulip Sadiq asks the prime minister about the welfare of 200 unaccompanied migrant children who’ve gone missing. ""Tory MP Jonathan Gullis heckles ‘well they shouldn’t have come here illegally’. Just when you think you’ve heard it all, the Tory Party find a new low.""  SNP Commons leader Deidre Brock fumed: ""A member on the benches opposite, who is clearly bent on establishing himself as some kind of Conservative Party pound shop (Nigel) Farage, reportedly shouted something really loathsome yesterday at PMQs about the 200 asylum-seeking children that are allegedly missing. ""It was so despicable I won't repeat it, but its content must be known to her through the outrage on social media. Will she join me in condemning his remarks, which by victim blaming potentially 200 missing vulnerable children, marks a new low in dehumanising language towards asylum seekers?"" Mr Gullis did not deny the comment, instead attacking Labour on migration. It comes after minister Robert Jenrick admitted 200 asylum-seeking children who were placed in hotels run by the Home Office are missing. At the weekend the Observer reported that a whistleblower from a Home Office hotel in Brighton said some children had been abducted off the street and bundled into cars. Mr Jenrick said he had ""not been presented with evidence that that has happened"" but will continue to investigate. In response to a query about the comment, Mr Gullis did not deny saying it, instead saying in a statement: ""Labour’s open door approach to illegal immigration shows they’re out of touch with the public, out of ideas on migration, and explains why they’ve been out of government for over a decade. ""I fully support the Prime Minister in stopping migrants claiming asylum who have entered the UK illegally, deporting them to safe third countries like Rwanda instead, and smash apart the vile smuggling gangs.""

Nadhim Zahawi's predecessor says Tory chairman's position is 'unsustainable',"Jake Berry said that there needs to be a ""mechanism"" for ministers who are under investigation to stand down, saying it is ""unsustainable"" to remain in post while an investigation is going onUnder-fire Nadhim Zahawi has been urged to step down by his predecessor as Tory chairman.  Senior Tory Sir Jake Berry told the BBC it is ""unsustainable"" for the Mr Zahawi remain in the role while Rishi Sunak's ethics adviser investigates his tax affairs.  Piling pressure on the Tory chairman, Mr Berry said the Government ""needs to find a mechanism for ministers and MPs who are under investigation to step aside"" temporarily. He said it is ""unsustainable"" for Mr Zahawi to remain in post. It comes after the boss of HMRC suggested Mr Zahawi did not make an ""innocent error"" amid a toxic row over the Tory Chairman's tax affairs. Rishi Sunak was this week branded ""weak"" by Labour for failing to remove the party chairman after it emerged he had paid a penalty to HMRC.   Mr Berry told BBC Question Time last night: “Even though he’s a friend of mine I’m not going to allow that to distract from a view I’ve put forward consistently in relation to all these sorts of issues. “The Government needs to find a mechanism for ministers and MPs who are under investigation in this way to step aside to clear their name and then to come back into government if that is appropriate. “I think from Nadhim, great individual that he is, that would be the right thing to do now. “I applaud Rishi Sunak for fast forwarding this investigation that we learned this week will be concluded in around 10 days. “But I do think it’s unsustainable for a minister to stay in his post while this investigation goes on, including other ministers who are also under investigation. “Not least because we have learned that when you want the public to have faith and trust in these investigations, one of the key things is for that individual to step away from power because it takes away a perception they have some influence or an ability to alter the investigation because they remain in that position of power.”  Meanwhile the Institute for Government's Dr Hannah White told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""If he had been suspended he wouldn't be trying to do his current job and facing embarrassing questions."". Labour's Deputy Leader Angela Rayner told The Mirror: “Tory MPs know the game is up for Nadhim Zahawi and even the man he succeeded has called for him to stand aside, but Rishi Sunak still hasn’t read the writing on the wall. ""The Prime Minister has proven himself too weak to sack his Tory Party Chair and has once again shown his appalling judgement by continuing to prop him up. ""Instead of getting their house in order, they're all over the shop. It’s a total failure of leadership from this clapped-out Government. Britain deserves better."" Mr Zahawi has said a ""careless but not deliberate"" error had been made, relating to shares in YouGov, the polling company he co-founded. In a statement at the weekend, he confirmed he had agreed to a settlement - estimated to be worth around £5million, including a penalty - while he was Chancellor in the dying days of Boris Johnson's Government. Mr Zahawi has given HMRC approval to speak to the investigation into his tax affairs, a source close to the Tory chairman said. Appearing in front of MPs on Thursday the permanent secretary at the tax office Jim Harra was asked what HMRC means when someone has been ""careless"". He explained: ""I'm not commenting on any particular person's affairs but carelessness is a concept in tax law. ""There are no penalties for innocent errors in your tax affairs. ""So if you take reasonable care but make a mistake whilst you will be liable for the tax and for interest if it's paid late you would not be liable for a penalty. ""If your error was as a result of carelessness, the legislation says a penalty could apply in those circumstances."" Mr Harra also told MPs on the Public Accounts Committee that if his officials at HMRC are asked they would assist the probe into Mr Zahawi. ""If we are asked by the independent adviser on ministerial interests to help with the inquiry, we will do so in any way we possibly can"", the tax boss said. Mr Harra also said that he could not comment on an individual's tax affairs, but signalled that HMRC could potentially offer a more public comment on a minister's tax affairs under certain circumstances.

It was a continent-wide cauldron of brutality stirred up by almost everyone else. If anyone needs to talk about the Holocaust, it's those who let anti-Semitism, anti-migrant rhetoric, and otherism take root in normal, everyday life.

Matt Hancock donates less than 5% of £320k I'm A Celebrity fee to charity,"Matt Hancock - who said 'it wasn’t the cheque' that convinced him to appear on I'm A Celebrity - has donated £10,000 to charity after receiving £320,000 to appear on the ITV showMatt Hancock has donated £10,000 to charity following his lucrative appearance on  I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! last year.   The politician was paid an eye-watering £320,000 for his appearance on the ITV series whilst still a sitting MP for West Suffolk - claiming at the time he was heading Down Under to raise awareness of dyslexia.   Mr Hancock implied his motivation for becoming a reality TV star alongside the likes of Hollyoaks actor Owen Warner and Chris Moyles was not financial before entering the star-studded camp as a late arrival.  ""I thought long and hard about this — in fact I turned down I’m A Celebrity . . . twice this summer, but when they approached me for a third time last week, I had a change of heart,"" he wrote on November 1.   ""And no, it wasn’t the cheque that changed my mind. I will be making a donation to St Nicholas Hospice in Suffolk and causes supporting dyslexia off the back of my appearance,"" he added in the piece for The Sun.  ""I will, of course, also declare the amount I receive from the show to Parliament to ensure complete transparency, as normal."" Documents published by the Houses of Commons state that Mr Hancock received an eye-watering amount from Lifted Entertainment, ITV, with the fee being registered on January 11, 2023.  Following Mr Hancock declaring the £320,000 fee, the Mirror can now reveal how much of the pay cheque has been donated to charitable and good causes so far.  A spokesperson for Mr Hancock told the Mirror: ""As well as raising the profile of his dyslexia campaign in front of 11-million viewers, Matt's donated £10,000 to St Nicholas Hospice in Suffolk and the British Dyslexia Association, off the back of his appearance on 'I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here'."" The Mirror has asked if Mr Hancock is planning to make any further donations but the politician's spokesperson is yet to respond.  When quizzed about how much of Mr Hancock's appearance fee will donated last year, the MP's team told the Mirror: ""We'll be speaking to the charities once Matt is back.""  ""By going on the show, Matt has raised the profile of his dyslexia campaign and used the platform to get the nation talking about an issue he really cares about in front of millions of people. Matt is determined that no child should leave primary school not knowing if they have dyslexia,"" a spokesperson said on November 27.  ""Matt will be making a donation to St Nicholas Hospice in Suffolk and causes supporting dyslexia - including the British Dyslexia Association, off the back of his appearance."" When pushed on if Mr Hancock plans to donate all his fee to charity, representatives stated again how ""the donations will be worked out on Matt's return"" and claimed both St Nicholas Hospice and the British Dyslexia Association ""are very happy with that arrangement"". Chivonne Preston, Chief Executive Officer of the British Dyslexia Association, recently issued a statement which reads: ""We are grateful when public figures like Matt use their platforms to draw attention to the barriers and challenges that the dyslexia community faces.  ""Dyslexia is misunderstood and despite being incredibly common is often hidden; many people in our community feel like their struggles are unseen. We welcome opportunities to shine a light on dyslexia and inspire people to seek help and support."" Mr Hancock reached the final of I'm a Celebrity in December - finishing third behind soap star Owen Warner and Queen of the Jungle Jill Scott.  Upon returning home to England, the MP for West Suffolk – who lost the Conservative whip after he agreed to appear on the ITV series - went on to announce that he will not be standing for re-election as an MP in the next general election.

Tory Sir Rod Stewart calls Sky News to say 'give Labour a go' amid NHS 'heartbreak',"Sir Rod Stewart was an unexpected caller to Sky News this afternoon where he attacked the Government over the state of the NHS and offered to pay for scans for people stuck on waiting lists Sir Rod Stewart has told the Tories to make way for Labour as he tore into the Government over the state of the NHS.  The 78-year-old veteran hitmaker was an unexpected caller to Sky News this afternoon where he offered to pay for scans for people stuck on waiting lists. Sir Rod said backed striking NHS workers who ""aren't asking for a great deal"" and said it was time to ""change the bloody Government"".  He said: ""I personally have been a Tory for a long time, but I think this Government should stand down now and give the Labour Party a go at it because this is heart-breaking for the nurses, it really is heart-breaking.  ""In all my years of living in this country I’ve never seen it so bad and anything I can do to help. Go on, the nurses. I’m on your side.”   Sir Rod, who said he was able to pay for his family to get private healthcare, said the NHS needed to be rebuilt with ""billions and billions"" of pounds. ""This is a bad time,"" he said. ""Change the bloody Government."" He said it was ""ridiculous"" that so many people were waiting for care and described how he visited a private clinic yesterday for his yearly scan where they only had ""a couple of customers"". ""I would like to pay for 10 or 20 scans. I don't know how we're going to work this but hopefully some other people will follow,"" he said. ""It seems ridiculous that this particular scanning clinic was empty and there are people dying because they cannot get scans. ""Now listen to me, I don't need the publicity, I just want to do some good things and this, I think is a good thing. If other people follow me, I'd love it.""  He said he had been listening to sad stories from callers on Sky News while he was working on his model railway. He added: ""I'm so proud to be British and I can't stand it being this way."" Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting tweeted: ""Maggie may have been a Tory but Rod's Labour!"" The unexpected intervention comes as health unions gear up for the biggest staff walkout in NHS history on February 6, when nurses and ambulance crews will down tools at the same time. More than 30,000 nurses and ambulance staff ­are due to go on strike together for the first time as the bitter dispute over pay intensifies. Thousands of operations and appointments face being cancelled and a bank holiday-style service is expected to operate in many areas. Thousands of teachers and civil servants are also due to take part in major walkouts on February 1, coinciding with a day of protests by the Trades Union Congress. Sir Rod left the UK in 1975 and moved to Los Angeles to avoid paying the top rate of tax, which at the time was 83p in the pound.  But he returned after nearly 40 years in 2014, so his kids could be educated in the UK.   The move angered critics who said Sir Rod had paid no UK tax for 39 years but wanted to return to enjoy the benefits of free schools, hospitals and public services.   He previously attracted criticism for congratulating Boris Johnson on Twitter over the Tory landslide in the 2019 election.

UK's public services at breaking point - it's time to protect our right to strike,"Today, the Mirror joins with the TUC and many others in fighting this assault on working people, and the unions they organise within, to Protect The Right To StrikeAs Britain gears up for ­landmark strike action next week, the powerful words of Jayaben Desai, the inspirational leader of the 1976 Grunwick strike, echo down the ­decades. “What you are running here is not a factory, it is a zoo. In a zoo, there are many types of animals. Some are monkeys that dance on your fingertips, others are lions who can bite your head off. “We are the lions, Mr Manager.” The ground-breaking strike at the film processing laboratory in North London was over two key issues. The right to strike, and human dignity. Some 46 years later, hundreds of thousands of mainly key workers will walk out next week over the same issues – in one of the biggest moments of industrial action in modern history.   Teachers, postal workers, nurses, ambulance workers, physiotherapists, midwives, rail workers, university staff, civil servants and bus drivers are all united in warning that our public and essential services are now at breaking point. Meanwhile, they face the same ­existential threat as the Grunwick strikers – as draconian new Tory anti-strike legislation ends the right of some workers to withdraw their labour without fear of repercussion.  Today, the Mirror joins with the TUC and many others in fighting this assault on working people, and the unions they organise within, to Protect The Right To Strike. The strike bill turns the clap – offered to key workers who kept us safe through the pandemic instead of a pay rise – into a slap in the face for workers.  Shiv, then Sunil, Desai was a summer temp worker at Grunwick during the heatwave of 1976, working alongside his mother, Jayaben. He witnessed the conditions in the factory including compulsory overtime. When Jayaben walked out following a short-notice demand for ­overtime, and the sacking of a young man, Shiv walked out with her. Some 137 staff followed them, well over a quarter of the factory. When the line manager compared her and her colleagues to chattering monkeys, Jayaben gave her now famously eloquent reply.  Union activist-turned-author Graham Taylor remembers scribbling down the speech. “I remember writing it down in my notebook in the rain outside the factory in 1976,” he says, “and realising even then that it would be one of her quotes that would ­resonate forever.” Jayaben died aged 77 in 2010, and Shiv now lives in India. I asked him what his mum’s advice would be for the workers walking out next week. “She would say that collective bargaining is the key,” he told me, “with clearly defined demands and steps to an effective settlement.” He also stressed the importance of “remaining open to any and all dialogue for negotiations”.  He added that Jayaben believed “the personal cause” had to be linked to the “public benefit” to gather support. There are unmistakable echoes of the Grunwick workers’ strike in the NHS strikes of today. Women make up 75% of all NHS staff from ­clinicians to porters. Meanwhile, one in four hospital staff are born outside the UK. “The Grunwick dispute was about the right to strike, which people working in public services are facing now,” says Taylor, who helped support the Grunwick women with the late Jack Dromey and Jack’s future wife Harriet Harman MP, then a local solicitor. He and Jack wrote the book, Grunwick: the Workers’ Story together. “But it was also that Jayaben and others felt the way they were treated was an affront to dignity. There is no dignity in nurses going to foodbanks.” The Grunwick women’s stand led to the biggest mobilisation in labour movement history. On one day alone, July 11, 1977, 20,000 workers came to the factory in Willesden, North West London, to show solidarity. The local postal workers refused to deal with the post at the factory, which was devastating for a mail-order ­business. Miners came from Durham and dockers from Liverpool. Margaret Thatcher would go on to ban solidarity strikes. But the coming days will see concerted action by trade unions. Each will fight their own grievance, yet taken together, the strikes will become more than the sum of their parts.  The Grunwick women were facing an intransigent factory owner, George Ward. He, in turn, was backed by the ultra-right National Association for Freedom. Now The Freedom ­Association, it continues to influence the Conservative Party with modern-day Tory MPs on its board – including Mark Francois and Sir Christopher Chope, who both voted for the new anti-strike laws. The Grunwick strike ultimately ended in defeat on July 14, 1978. But it changed the face of the modern trade union movement and became totemic. “Jayaben noted quite ruefully that workers who didn’t go on strike did get a pay rise and better pensions in the end,” Graham Taylor says. “They actually won.” Jayaben Desai remained hopeful about what had been achieved. “They wanted to break us down, but we did not break,” she said. Meanwhile, ­solidarity built at Grunwick endured. Jack Dromey – the trade unionist who would later become the Labour MP for Birmingham Erdington – spoke of “an enduring bond of love between us all.” Sujata Aurora, who chaired the Grunwick 40 project, was inspired by an iconic photograph of Jayaben she saw as a child. “I remember being really struck by this image of a woman in a sari with her fist raised,” she says. “It’s really heartening to see so many people galvanised now – coming out on their own issues but understanding we really are all in this together.” This coming Wednesday sees a day of strikes when hundreds of thousands of people will withdraw their labour on behalf of us all. It has also been designated a day of action led by the TUC, defending the right to strike itself. It is time for a new pride of lions, Mr Manager. Have you or your family been affected by the cuts? Or have you been shocked by how your area has been hit? I want to reveal what's really happening around the country every week. Email realbritain@mirror.co.uk.

One in 10 healthcare workers quit NHS last year with burnout and low pay to blame,"Burnout and poor pay and conditions have been causing record numbers of NHS staff to leave their jobs, with 148,640 staff quitting in the 12 months to SeptemberMore than one in 10 health workers left the ailing NHS last year in a new grim record. Reasons behind the exodus include poor working conditions, pay and extreme “burnout”, especially after dealing with Covid. The Institute for Government found 148,640 staff quit in the 12 months to September, or 10.8% of the workforce, compared to 9.1% in the year before. It highlighted the shocking figures in its report The NHS crisis: Does the government have a plan?  More than 6.2million sick days were lost due to mental illness in the year October 2021 to September 2022, figures show, compared to 5.95m the year before. Psychiatric issues such as anxiety, stress and depression are consistently the most reported reasons. The NHS is facing its biggest strike day with paramedics and 999 call handlers to walk out on February 6 with colleagues from wards and clinics.   The Government has said their demand for better pay is “unaffordable”. But the IfG report suggests it is a “political decision” not to increase the wages. More than 40,000 nurses have left the NHS in the past year – one in nine of the workforce – according to data examined by the Nuffield Trust in September. Think tank the King’s Fund found the largest increase was among younger nurses. The NHS lost more than 20,000 doctors in 12 months – nearly twice the number needed to plug gaps. Alex Baylis, assistant director of policy at the King’s Fund, said: “Eye-watering levels of stress and burnout have been normalised. “An inability to keep a work-life balance is by far becoming the biggest reason why people are leaving the NHS.” Dr Latifa Patel, of doctors’ union the BMA, said: “We’ve repeatedly warned this Government what was coming, yet the required actions were not taken.”  The Royal College of Nursing director for England, Patricia Marquis, said: “This demonstrates that cutting nursing pay is a political decision.” Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: “The Government must urgently fix perverse pension rules, forcing doctors into early retirement.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: “There are already record numbers of staff working in the NHS – over 4,800 more doctors and over 10,900 more nurses worked in the NHS compared to November 2021. “And we are on track to deliver 50,000 more nurses by the end of parliament.” But researcher Stuart Hoddinott at the IfG wrote that the number of vacancies has risen to 133,000, a new high. He said: “Even though recruitment has been strong, total staff numbers have not kept pace with that need because of severe retention issues.” The King’s Fund noted last year the NHS is the largest employer in England, with 1.2m full-time equivalent staff. He added: “It’s not right. We can’t live in a country where nurses are having to use food banks to get by, while bankers are allowed to help themselves to unlimited bumper bonuses.” The figures come as NHS workers prepare for their biggest strike ever.  Over 30,000 nurses and ambulance staff are expected to stage a walk out on Monday, February 6 in an ongoing dispute over pay.  It marks the first time that nurses and ambulance staff will head to the picket line together.  Paramedics and 999 call handlers will also walk out alongside colleagues from wards and clinics. NHS Providers director of policy Miriam Deakin said: “Trust leaders are facing what for many may be the most ­challenging day of their careers. “Nobody wants these strikes to happen but it’s clear staff feel they have been driven to this. “It’s absolutely imperative that the Government sit down with the unions immediately to resolve this by talking about pay for this financial year.” Read the Institute for Government report: The NHS crisis: Does the government have a plan?

He knocks Denise Coates, head of gambling empire Bet365, her brother John and father Peter Coates - worth a collective £8.6billion - off the top spot for biggest taxpayer, according to the Sunday Times Tax List. The Coates family were the second biggest taxpayers this year, down from first place in 2022, having forked out £460.2million.   In third place was Stephen Rubin and family, owners of sport and fashion brands Speedo, Kickers and Berghaus, who paid £392.3million in tax. Ben Francis, the chief executive of athletics and leisure brand Gymshark, is the youngest person to appear with his contribution to the public finances standing at £11.6 million.  Other notable names on the list include retail tycoon and Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley who paid £133.5million and came in sixth place.  Wetherspoon founder Tim Martin was next in seventh place, paying £123.2million in UK tax. The pub chain chairman told The Sunday Times it was ""vitally important"" that more companies reported all the tax they paid. He added: ""Without this perspective people may become more cynical about free enterprise, which is the vital engine of prosperity, and thereby freedom, for democratic societies.""   In total, the 100 wealthy individuals or families who appear in the Sunday Times Tax List were liable for a total of £5.181 billion in tax. Each person or family who ranked paid at least £10.7million either personally or through their businesses. The fifth edition of the Tax List was released as millions of people race to meet the self-assessment deadline.  Robert Watts, the compiler of The Sunday Times Tax List, said: “You will find celebrities on the Tax List but many of the entries are people who quietly run largely unheralded businesses that have been creating jobs and paying millions of tax for decades or even centuries.  “So-called ‘unicorn’ tech firms may dominate the headlines, but they often aren’t cash cows for the Treasury because they don’t employ large numbers of people or show big profits. It’s the long-established retailers, pub groups and other bricks-and-mortar businesses that often contribute more.  “There lies the challenge for the chancellor and his successors. As our economy inevitably shifts further and further online, how do we continue to fund the public services we all want?” He added: “Alex Gerko’s story is an extraordinary read. This was a man who could have been one of Russia’s greatest wealth creators — instead he is creating jobs and paying his tax here.  “Enticing the super-rich to London doesn’t always pay dividends for the public finances. In his case it certainly has.”   Sunday Times Tax List 2023 in full  Alex Gerko - £487.4m Denise, John and Peter Coates - £460.2m Stephen Rubin and family - £392.3m Sir Chris Hohn - £263m Fred and Peter Done and family - £136.8m Mike Ashley - £133.5m Tim Martin - £123.2m Ranjit and Baljinder Boparan and family - £120.7m Tom Morris and family - £112.2m Ian and Richard Livingstone - £104m Dame Mary and Douglas Perkins and family - £100.9m Sir James Dyson and family - £93m Lady Philomena Clark and family - £92.7m Leonie Schroder and family - £88.7m John Bloor - £86.4m Glenn Gordon and family - £81.6m Will Adderley and family - £69.8m The Marshall family - £60.3m Kathy and John Murphy and family - £59.8m Peter Kelly - £59.6m Caspar and Sebastian MacDonald-Hall and family - £59m The Duke of Westminster and the Grosvenor family - £57.5m Lord Bamford and family - £54.7m Henry Moser - £53.8m Bernard Lewis and family - £52.6m James and John Martin and family - £50.2m The Thomson family - £48.6m Agust and Lydur Gudmundsson - £47.3m Greg Skinner - £45.6m Suneil Setiya - £45.6m Fawn and India Rose James - £44.5m Malcolm Healey - £42.7m Nigel Spokes and family - £42.7m The Lazari family - £40.7m John Timpson and family - £40.3m Henry Engelhardt and Diane Briere De L'Isle - £39.7m Earl Cadogan and family - £38.1m James Wates and family - £37m Peter and Fiona Cruddas - £36m Baroness Howard de Walden and family - £33m Will Roseff - £32.9m Mark Samworth and family - £32.3m Peter Hargreaves - £31.5m Chris and Sarah Dawson - £30.5m The Shepherd family - £29.9m Lord Edmiston - £29.7m Joe Hemani - £29.2m Chris Sheppard and family - £29.1m Andrew Brown - £29.1m Paul Day and family - £28.1m Chris Oglesby and family - £27.3m  Sting - £25m Daren Whitaker - £23.9m Simon Orange - £23.9m The Warburton family - £23.8m Barry and Eddie Hearn and family - £23.4m Steve Morgan - £23.1m Surinder Kandola - £22.9m Douglas and Iain Anderson - £21.5m Michael Kirkland and family - £21.4m The Gibbon family - £20.9m David McMurtry - £20.2m William Barnett and family - £19.7m Clinton McCarthy and family - £19.6m Joanne Conway and family - £19.6m Simon, Bobby and Robin Arora - £19.5m Patrick Flannery and family - £19.3m Mark Coombs - £18.5m Andrew Vincent - £18.5m Mark Hunter - £18.5m The Bailey family - £18.4m The Tordoff family - £17.4m Brian and Alan Stannah and family - £17.2m Douglas Park and family - £16.9m Martin Hughes - £16.6m Gordon Sanders - £16.4m Peter Dawson and family - £15.9m Freddie Linnett and the Murphy family £15.5m James Watt - £15.5m Martin Dickie - £15.2m JK Rowling - £15m Karin Mortstedt and family - £15m Frank Hester - £14.3m Rupert Martin - £14.2m Garry Newman - £13.7m Chrissie Rucker and Nick Wheeler - £13.5m Tim and Polly Gredley and family - £13.2m Alastair Campbell and family - £13.1m Richard Dick and family - £12.4m Andrew Nisbet and family - £11.6m Lord Iliffe and family - £11.6m Douglas Woolf and family - £11.6m Ben Francis - £11.6m David Wernick and family - £11.4m John Coulter and Ann Jones - £11.1m Martin and Caroline Bell - £11m Lisa and Tony Wilkinson and family £10.8m Trevor Senior - £10.7m Robert Fenwick - £10.7m Alexander Marr and family - £10.7m  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/uks-biggest-taxpayers-8billion-betting-29056851
Should Matt Hancock have donated more of his I'm A Celebrity fee to charity?,"The former Health Secretary has donated three per cent of his I'm A Celeb pay packet to charity, but do you think he should have given more? Vote in our poll to have your say.Matt Hancock has donated less than five per cent of his I’m A Celebrity earnings to charity - and we want to know what you think. The former Health Secretary was paid a lucrative £320,000 for his appearance on the popular ITV show - of which he gave £10,000 to good causes. Ahead of his debut Down Under, the MP for West Suffolk claimed he was entering the jungle to raise awareness of dyslexia. Mr Hancock implied that his motivation for becoming a reality TV star wasn’t financial and announced he would be making a donation to causes supporting dyslexia, as well as St Nicholas Hospice in Bury St Edmunds. Documents published by the Houses of Commons state that Mr Hancock received an eye-watering amount from Lifted Entertainment, ITV, with the fee being registered on January 11, 2023. A spokesperson for Mr Hancock told the Mirror: ""As well as raising the profile of his dyslexia campaign in front of 11-million viewers, Matt's donated £10,000 to St Nicholas Hospice in Suffolk and the British Dyslexia Association, off the back of his appearance on 'I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here'."" The Mirror has asked if Mr Hancock is planning to make any further donations but the politician's spokesperson is yet to respond. Chivonne Preston, Chief Executive Officer of the British Dyslexia Association, recently issued a statement which reads: ""We are grateful when public figures like Matt use their platforms to draw attention to the barriers and challenges that the dyslexia community faces."" Taking to Twitter, some people say the politician should have donated a larger sum of money, as one user wrote: “Only £10k given to charity??? That’s less than 5 per cent. Unreal. He should have donated it all.” Meanwhile, others defend Mr Hancock’s donation: “Why should he have to give any of it to charity?? It's his money. How much did the other contestants donate?” Do you think Matt Hancock should have donated more of his I’m A Celeb fee to charity? Vote in our poll to have your say.

"'After 13 years, the Tories' only achievement is record-breaking NHS wait times'","As Sir Rod Stewart becomes the latest Tory backer to denounce the party, it's no wonder polls show they're haemorrhaging voters - 13 years of neglect have left NHS waiting times at levels never seen beforeSir Rod Stewart is not the only lifelong Conservative to turn against the party. Polls show the Tories are haemorrhaging support from those of all ages and ­backgrounds. Like Sir Rod, they despair at how 13 years of rule have turned a once prosperous land with excellent public services into a broken state. High on the list of this government’s failures is the damage caused to the NHS. When Labour left in 2010 public satisfaction with the service was at a record high. The only records achieved by the Tories are the highest waiting list in history and the slowest ambulance response times. It is hardly a surprise that nearly 150,000 NHS staff members, one in 10 of the workforce, left their jobs in the year to September. They know better than anyone else what it is like to work for a health service that cannot provide the care patients need and deserve.

HS2 in CHAOS as Tories won't deny £60bn rail scheme may not run to London Euston,"Britain's flagship HS2 rail could end up only running to the suburn of Old Oak Common in West London rather than the central Euston location as the shambles sparks fears the Birmingham to Crewe and Manchester legs could also be scrapped in their entiretyThe Tory Government has refused to deny reports that the multi-billion flagship HS2 project linking the North and the Midlands to the capital may never actually reach central London anymore. The shambolic project has been blighted by soaring inflation and rising construction costs and bosses are said to be considering scaling it back, with suggestions major sectors of the line may be forced to close or scrapped altogether. It could mean that the central Euston terminus is delayed to 2038 or scrapped altogether, meaning one of the key promises of the flagship scheme may never be met - after its construction caused major upheaval across England, knocking down homes, schools and businesses and removing green spaces. Work has already begun at Birmingham's Curzon Street station in the city centre - but it is reported a two to five-year delay to the entire project is now being considered.  The new plans discuss high-speed trains running from the suburb of Old Oak Common in West London rather than Euston to save money. This would mean that commuters will have to actually use the new Elizabeth line to complete their journeys into central London. And it has sparked fears that Birmingham to Crewe and Manchester's legs of the plan will also be scrapped entirely.   One ex-HS2 employee told The Sun: “There are a number of options for getting the costs down and none of them is very nice. “Either you scrap Euston, or you have to slow down the whole project and hope inflation comes down.” Last year, ministers were said to be looking at to be reviewing the costs for HS2. The budget for the whole of the route was set at £55.7billion in 2015. And the target cost of building the link between London and Birmingham was said to be £40.3billion in 2019. The target cost of Phase One between London and Birmingham was £40.3 billion at 2019 prices.  But reports today suggest the first ­London to Birmingham phase alone could cost £60billion.  However, the government has refused to confirm or deny reports. A Department for Transport spokesman said: “The Government remains committed to delivering HS2 to Manchester, as confirmed in the autumn statement. “As well as supporting tens of thousands of jobs, the project will connect regions across the UK, improve capacity on our railways and provide a greener option of travel.” The Tories have previously been accused of ""selling out the North"" and betraying their vow to 'level up' the UK, as promise after promise over northern rail links and HS2 were broken in recent years. The project has repeatedly been called into question over the years over its massive financial and environmental impact. Penny Gaines of the campaign group Stop HS2 said it is ""not at all surprising"" that costs are spiralling out of control, and she called for HS2 to be scrapped ""in its entirety"". She added: ""These reports just show that there are so many problems with HS2. It's being delayed further and further so the cost is going up, it should be cancelled in its entirety as soon as possible. ""Stop spending money building a railway people don't need. Use the money to restore the countryside and the areas that are being devastated by HS2 and look at the solutions that people need in the 21st century. ""It's London-centric and now it turns out that it's not even going to manage to get to the centre of London.""  The current leader of Camden Council, Councillor Georgia Gould, said HS2 has knocked down 200 homes and in her central London borough and ""razed sections to the ground"". She said: “These reports represent more unacceptable uncertainty to a project which has already knocked down 200 homes in Camden and razed sections of our borough to the ground.  “HS2 construction has left a deep scar in our communities - our residents have had their homes knocked down, their school and businesses have been demolished and their green space has been removed.  “Our residents will fear that they will have to endure years of disruption for absolutely no benefit at the end of it. They must see the new homes, green spaces and opportunities they were promised - HS2 must not walk away and abandon our communities.” While the former leader of Camden Council, Sarah Hayward, branded the development ""quite extraordinary"" and said communities have been ""blighted"" for years. She posted on Twitter: ""The communities and businesses in the surrounds of the station have already been blighted for nearly 15 years. ""But more than that, it asks very fundamental questions about how the UK business cases and costs very long term infrastructure investment. ""These questions were obvious at the outset of the project and remained through both Labour and Tory governments."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/hs2-chaos-tories-wont-deny-29063285
"Taxpayer bill for Boris Johnson's Partygate defence soars to £222,000 - and could rise more","Today a senior civil servant confirmed that the estimated cost in defending the shamed former Prime Minister had soared by more than £90,000 since 2022 Taxpayers are expected to foot a massive £222,000 bill for Boris Johnson's legal defence against allegations he misled Parliament over Partygate. Today a senior civil servant confirmed that the estimated cost in defending the shamed former Prime Minister had soared by more than £90,000 since 2022. And it could go up still further, Cabinet Office permanent secretary Alex Chisholm admitted. The sum has sparked immediate criticism, with the Lib Dems branding it a ""sleazy new low"". Mr Johnson, now a backbench MP, faces a probe over his denials of lockdown-busting gatherings in No10, with hearings likely to begin in March. He is being investigated by the House of Commons Privileges Committee, which will determine whether he committed contempt of Parliament - an allegation he denies.   Solicitors firm Peters and Peters were awarded a contract worth £129,700 to provide Mr Johnson with advice during the investigation. Mr Chisholm confirmed that the sum had risen dramatically, and could not guarantee it wouldn't go up even further. Pressed on whether the amount could rise still further, Mr Chisholm said: ""It could potentially exceed that."" Liberal Democrat Chief Whip Wendy Chamberlain said: ""While the British people battle with a cost-of-living crisis, this Conservative Government seems more interested in helping Boris Johnson with his cost-of-lying crisis. This is a sleazy new low for this Government, dragging politics into the gutter. ""People will be outraged that hundreds of thousands of pounds of their money will be used to defend a lying lawbreaker who disgraced the office of Prime Minister. ""Rishi Sunak needs to step in immediately, stop this fund and apologise for his Government's chaotic track record of defending the indefensible."" At a meeting of the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee on Thursday, Tory MP David Jones questioned the spending. He asked Mr Chisholm: ""Is it normal for the government to pay for legal advice in such circumstances?"" The civil servant responded: ""It is normal, there's an established precedent across multiple administrations that former ministers can be supported with legal representation after they've left office when the matters relate to their time and conduct as a minister.""  Mr Chisholm said the amount had been increased due to the length of the committee inquiry. He said: ""At the moment we have estimated that it would be up to a figure of £200,000, which has been published, £222,000 to be precise.  ""We hope and expect that will be a maximum figure but obviously we don't want to anticipate and certainly could not regulate the conduct of the committee, which is entirely up to them."" Mr Chisholm told the committee the contract with Peters and Peters had received ""very full scrutiny from all the relevant people"". The contract with Peters and Peters has already paid for legal advice from leading KC Lord Pannick, who has produced two opinions on the inquiry. The first was published on the Government's website in September 2021 - claiming the Privileges Committee was adopting an ""unfair procedure"" and a ""fundamentally flawed"" approach. But this was rejected by the committee, which said it was based on ""a systemic misunderstanding of the parliamentary process and misplaced analogies with the criminal law"". Lord Pannick went on to publish a second opinion, but this has not been published.  Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden said he could not confirm why, because it happened before he took on the role. Downing Street repeatedly dismissed the Mirror's revelations about lockdown breaking parties, which later led to police fines for Mr Johnson and the new PM Rishi Sunak. The Metropolitan Police dished out 126 fixed penalty notices to 83 people over 12 pandemic gatherings in Downing Street and Whitehall, including six events Mr Johnson is believed to have attended. Whitehall enforcer Sue Gray published a damning report on the extent of the boozing, including wine on the walls, vomiting and a brawl, as well as a lack of respect for cleaners and security staff. The Privileges Committee probe “includes but is not limited to” four statements Mr Johnson made in December 2021 in the Commons, where he denied parties had taken place in No10. He said “all guidance was followed” - a claim he later corrected, but said he thought was right at the time - and also explicitly denied there had been a bash on November 13 2020. But the PM was later pictured holding a glass of fizz at a leaving do on that day - which he has since claimed it was his “duty” to attend.

Holocaust Memorial Day: Five survivors and the precious objects they smuggled to safety,"To mark Holocaust Memorial Day, five survivors recall their stories, and the item they still have that means so much to them as part of the Daily Mirror's #PeopleMove projectSome fled with nothing but the threadbare clothes on their backs, others managed a suitcase filled with a few precious belongings. But crucially for each person who escaped the Holocaust and made it to safety in Britain, they had their lives when so many others did not. It is a sentiment that still resonates today. For the past six months the Daily Mirror’s #PeopleMove Instagram project has been providing a platform for refugees and displaced people, a place to share their stories. We share portraits of people who will tell their story of an object they managed to bring with them on their journey to safety. And today to mark Holocaust Memorial Day, five survivors recall their stories, and the item they still have that means so much to them. Yvonne Bernstein, 85 - Germany - letter “This is a typed note my mother gave to her sister, when she handed me over, in April 1939. It had instructions on how to look after me, what I liked to eat, I was only two. My aunt in France was going to look after me until I could join my parents in England. I ended up staying for six years.  My father was working in Holland, when Kristallnacht happened. He was advised not to return to Germany where we lived. He got a visa for England. My mother tried to apply for us both, but was only granted one. She arrived in Nottingham to work as a domestic. I cried my eyes out for a few weeks, but over time my aunt became like my mother and my cousin like my older sister. When the Germans entered Sarrebourg in France in July 1940 my aunt was given 24 hours to leave. We went to Paris to stay with her sister-in-law until my uncle found us a small flat.  Everything was okay until 17 Jan, 1944. At 7am there was a knock on the door. Someone had given us away. My uncle was taken to prison and sent to Auschwitz, where he died. My aunt took us to hide in the warehouse where my uncle worked. Later my cousin and I were hidden in a convent until my aunt obtained false papers in different names and a job as a concierge with the help of the resistance. On August 24, 1944, Paris was liberated and my father was allowed to come and find us. I moved to Nottingham to be with my parents and brother. A year later we moved to Birmingham, where my father worked in the jewellery quarter. I went to university in London and graduated with a PhD. I married Leo and had three children.” Lord Alf Dubs, 90 – Czechoslovakia – luggage tag “The only object I have from home is the luggage tag my mother put on my suitcase. It says, ‘Harwich 1939’. That’s where I was going, from my home city of Prague to England – one of 669 mainly Jewish children who escaped on the Kindertransport special trains after the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia.  A few days earlier, we had to tear the picture of our President Benes from our schoolbooks, and stick in a picture of Hitler. I was six-years-old, and I don’t remember very much about the journey. I remember the hard wooden seats, and the darkness. I remember my mother waving me off, surrounded by German soldiers and swastikas. The last time many of the children on our train ever saw their parents. When we got to the Dutch border, some older children started cheering. I didn’t know we had reached safety – I was too busy looking out for windmills.  We came through the Hook of Holland and then by boat to Harwich, and then by train to Liverpool Street. I was one of the lucky ones because my Jewish father had already escaped and was waiting for me. I remember my dad eating the sandwiches my mum had packed for me that I hadn’t touched. When my mum went to apply for a visa, they threw her down the stairs. The only thing that saved her was the fact they threw her passport after her. She arrived in London on August 31, 1939. Germany attacked Poland a day later. Fleeing Prague caused us to lose almost everything, but it saved our lives. Only three members of my family survived the Nazis. When the Gestapo came for my father’s cousins in 1942, one took their own life by biting on a cyanide pill and the other was murdered at Auschwitz.  My dad died within a year of a heart attack. My mum also died young. I became a Labour MP, and now sit in the House of Lords. There’s a little thankyou plaque next door in the House of Commons on behalf of the 10,000 children who came on the Kindertransport from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia.” Steven Frank, 87 - Amsterdam - cooking pan “Theresienstadt camp was one of three camps my mother, two brothers and I were sent to in 1944. It was overcrowded and disease-ridden. My mother got a job in the hospital laundry so she could access hot water. She would fill a quarter of this pan with extra rations of breadcrumbs she got and boiling water to make a porridge-like paste to feed us.  Shortly before my father was arrested and sent to prison. He was a well-respected, humanitarian, wanting to help less-fortunate people. He joined the Dutch resistance. He would hide Jews in our home. He wrote for an underground newspaper but he was betrayed. He was taken to SS HQ in Amsterdam and prison where he was tortured and beaten. My mother managed to disguise herself as a male cleaner and sneaked in to briefly see him. My father was sent to Auschwitz and gassed on 21 January 1943.  We stayed in three camps and survived by some sort of internal strength. Later we moved to England where I completed my education. I then got married, had three children and graduated from university. I have been awarded a fellowship from the University of Winchester, a Bafta for a BBC film and a BEM for my Holocaust services. I have now given over 900 school talks.” Trude Silman, 93 - Czechoslovakia - autograph book “This autograph book was given to me by my parents in November ‘38 - it is full of memories. When I came to England in 1939 - with my aunt - I brought my autograph book with me.  I could only bring a few things because there was limited luggage. I had a scarf my mother gave me, the belt of my mother’s nightdress and my father gave me a prayer book. I went to a Jewish school in Bratislava. There were 55 children in my class and I took the autograph book there. Some of my classmates wrote in it with poems and some beautiful drawings. There are messages in Slovak, German and Hungarian. Later there is English from my school mistresses and friends when I was here. Throughout the war I was always hopeful we would be reunited as a family. Every night I said a little prayer - that my parents were well and we would meet again. But this never happened.  My father was killed within two weeks of being sent to Auschwitz in 1942. I still don’t know when, how, or where my mother died and I am still trying to find out. My family was destroyed just because we were Jewish. Of the 55 children in my class, I only know of two who survived, apart from me. But I have made a life here, when you are displaced you have no choice. I don’t feel 100 per cent English, I’m a hybrid. I still sometimes think in German. I went to university and became a biochemist. I have been involved in Holocaust education, telling my story in the hope these things wouldn’t happen again. But the world is in a dark place. I’m at the stage where I can say, ‘I’m glad I’m going out, not going in’.” Sandra Miller, 68 - Poland - waistcoat “This waistcoat is the only physical link my mother Sabina had to her family. It was with her throughout the war - it survived because she was wearing it, it was really all she had. She passed it to me and I’ll pass it to my daughters and they will pass it to theirs.  My mother was the only one of her family to survive the war. She lived in Warsaw with her family, they were Jewish, she had a happy childhood. When the Nazis invaded they were forced to live in the ghetto. Her parents, older sister and two brothers were all murdered. She escaped to an aunt’s and then to the countryside before swapping identities with a Polish peasant girl. She had taken a few things with her - photographs and other things - but they were stolen when she was hiding in the woods. She hid her Jewish identity and worked as a farm girl in Germany.  The waistcoat survived because she was wearing it. It would have been part of a suit originally, it had sleeves. My parents met after the war and married - my dad had been in the Polish Army which meant they had the chance to come to England. She had two children, six grandchildren and 11 great grandchildren and she created a family, she made friends with other Polish, Jewish survivors. My mum loved Britain - she thought it was the most amazing country. The tolerance was something she treasured and felt people should never take for granted. She passed away in March 2018, she was 95 and still cheerful - a joy.” Follow our project at instagram.com/peoplemove_ ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/holocaust-memorial-day-five-survivors-29049702
Matt Hancock's eye-watering I'm A Celebrity fee revealed after ITV stint,"Matt Hancock's extravagant fee for appearing on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! has finally been revealed in a Commons report – one month after his appearance Matt Hancock was paid an eye-watering £320,000 for his appearance on  I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!   The MP appeared on screen for 720 hours (30 days) alongside the likes of Mike Tindall, Owen Warner and Queen of the Jungle, Jill Scott.  Documents published by the Houses of Commons state that Hancock received an eye-watering amount from Lifted Entertainment, ITV, with the fee being registered on January 11, 2023. At the time of appearing on the show, Hancock explained that a sum of his fee would be donated to several charities although a spokesperson was unable to confirm if all of the amounts would be donated.   They told The Mirror that Hancock ""will be making a donation to St Nicholas Hospice in Suffolk and causes supporting dyslexia - including the British Dyslexia Association, off the back of his appearance,"" but refused to comment when asked where the rest of the money would be going. But the 44-year-old claimed that the pay cheque was not what helped him decide to go onto the show, instead, he insisted that he thought ""long and hard"" having initially declined an offer from ITV. Writing in The Sun, he said: ""It wasn't the cheque that changed my mind. I will be making a donation to St Nicholas Hospice in Suffolk and causes supporting dyslexia off the back of my appearance.   ""I will, of course, also declare the amount I receive from the show to Parliament to ensure complete transparency, as normal."" A spokesperson later confirmed that the amount donated to each charity would be discussed with Mr Hancock upon his arrival back into the UK. Despite initial backlash after entering the ITV programme, Hancock managed to sail through to the final and came third on the show after completing several Bushtucker Trials. But while he may have landed in the final of the show, he didn't manage to win over all of the public and was subsequently booed by the audience after attending Seann Walsh's comedy gig.  Hancock and his I'm A Celeb co-star Boy George attended Seann's gig at London's Soho Theatre with one enraged audience member branding him a ""w**ker"". In April 2022, Hancock apologised after the High Court ruled government policies on discharging patients from hospital into care homes at the onset of the pandemic were ""unlawful"". And in June 2021 he was forced to resign as Health secretary after CCTV footage surfaced of him embracing his aide Gina Coladangelo at a time when this would breach his own rules on physical contact. It also ended his 15-year marriage. The former Health Secretary announced he would not stand for the Conservative Party in the next General Election – despite his team insisting that he had no intentions of turning his back on politics.

"£14.9billion wasted on PPE, Covid tests and vaccine that won't be used","Labour’s Wes Streeting said it was 'staggering' the taxpayers’ money had been 'wasted on useless' as he warned the Conservatives can 'never again claim to be the careful stewards of the public finances'An astonishing £14.9billion has been spent on personal protective equipment, Covid tests and medicines that will not be used, it has been revealed. Labour’s Wes Streeting said it was ""staggering"" the taxpayers’ money had been ""wasted on useless"" PPE. The Department of Health and Social Care reported a £2.5 billion write-down on items originally costing £11.2 billion. The department had already purchased the goods - including PPE, lateral flow and PCR testing kits, along with Covid vaccines and medicines - but no longer expects to use them, or the market price is now lower than that paid. A further £3.5 billion was a write-down on PPE, vaccines and medication which the DHSC has ""committed to purchase, but no longer expects to use"". Mr Streeting said: ""The Conservatives can never again claim to be the careful stewards of the public finances,"" he said.   ""While Rishi Sunak had control of the purse strings, a staggering £15 billion of public money was wasted on useless PPE - enough to fund the police force for an entire year. ""Instead, that money is now literally going up in smoke. ""Taxpayers will rightly judge the carelessness with which the Conservatives treat their money to be an absolute scandal.""

Home Secretary's decision to U-turn on Windrush reforms branded 'slap in the face',"Labour frontbencher David Lammy said those affected by the Windrush scandal were being 'once again spat on' after Home Secretary Suella Braverman's decision to ditch a set of key reformsThe Home Secretary has U-turned on reforms designed to prevent another Windrush scandal in a move described as a ""slap in the face"" by campaigners. Suella Braverman quietly announced that she had ditched a commitment to establish a migrants' commissioner and also rowed back on calls to boost the powers of the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration (ICIBI). She also abandoned a plan to hold reconciliation events with those affected by the Windrush scandal, which saw British citizens wrongly threatened with deportation, stripped of their jobs, benefits or even their homes as they didn't have the right paperwork. Those affected were people who moved to the UK between the 1940s to 1970s, mostly from Caribbean countries. The name refers to HMT Windrush, which brought workers from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and other islands to the UK to help solve post-war labour shortages. Labour frontbencher David Lammy said those affected were being ""once again spat on"" by the Tories.   Patrick Vernon, convenor of the Windrush 75 network, who organised the Windrush anniversary celebrations who helped organise the anniversary celebrations, said: ""For the Home Secretary to be backsliding on Government commitments to set right the injustices of the Windrush scandal - particularly in this anniversary year - is a slap in the face for those communities. ""Suella Braverman should make a clear commitment to right the wrongs of the Windrush scandal."" Wendy Williams, the solicitor who carried out the Windrush Lessons Learned Review in 2020, said she was ""disappointed"" by the decision.  Former home secretary Priti Patel had originally accepted all 30 of the recommendations made by Ms Williams, including the three ditched on Thursday. Ms Williams warned last year that without a migrants commissioner, the Home Office risked undermining its efforts to improve policy ""as well as the efforts to rebuild its reputation"". David Neal, the current ICIBI, said it was a ""missed opportunity"" not to look at increasing the powers associated with his role. ""A role and remit review would have provided an opportunity to assess whether the level of resourcing provided to the inspectorate is appropriate,"" he said.  Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper blasted the U-turn as ""yet another betrayal of the Windrush generation"". She said: ""Four years after Wendy Williams's review, just eight of its recommendations have been fully implemented and now some have been dropped altogether, including important safeguards to strengthen the borders inspectorate. ""The Home Office had an opportunity to put its apology to the Windrush victims into action, but it is tragic that the Home Secretary hasn't learned the lessons of that appalling scandal."" Mr Lammy, who wrote a landmark report on racial discrimination in the justice system, said: ""Black Britons detained and deported by their own government are once again being spat on by the Conservative government. ""Suella Braverman's animosity towards our shared multicultural future is trauma-inducing. Our country's brave Windrush victims denied justice yet again."" Ms Braverman made the announcement in a written statement to the Commons, declaring that she had ""decided not to proceed"" with three of Ms Williams' recommendations ""in their original format"". She said she would instead look to ""shift culture and subject ourselves to scrutiny"". A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We are making progress towards the vast majority of recommendations from Wendy Williams' report, and believe there are more meaningful ways of achieving the intent of a very small number of others. ""Through this work, we will make sure that similar injustices can never be repeated and are creating a Home Office worthy of every community it serves.""

HMRC chief suggests Tory Chairman Nadhim Zahawi did not make 'innocent' tax error,"The permanent secretary at the tax office Jim Harra also said HMRC would 'help with the inquiry' into the Tory Chairman 'in any way we possibly can' if requested by Rishi Sunak ethics adviserThe boss of HMRC has suggested Nadhim Zahawi did not make an ""innocent error"" amid a toxic row over the Tory Chairman's tax affairs.  The comments come as the Cabinet minister clings to his role in Government after Rishi Sunak ordered an investigation by his ethics adviser.  Yesterday the Prime Minister was forced to endure mockery in the Commons and was branded ""hopelessly weak"" for failing to sack the senior Tory. Mr Zahawi has said a ""careless but not deliberate"" error had been made, relating to shares in YouGov, the polling company he co-founded. In a statement at the weekend, he confirmed he had agreed to a settlement - estimated to be worth around £5million, including a penalty - while he was Chancellor in the dying days of Boris Johnson's Government. Mr Zahawi has given HMRC approval to speak to the investigation into his tax affairs, a source close to the Tory chairman said.   Appearing in front of MPs on Thursday the permanent secretary at the tax office Jim Harra was asked what HMRC means when someone has been ""careless"". He explained: ""I'm not commenting on any particular person's affairs but carelessness is a concept in tax law. ""There are no penalties for innocent errors in your tax affairs. ""So if you take reasonable care but make a mistake whilst you will be liable for the tax and for interest if it's paid late you would not be liable for a penalty. ""If your error was as a result of carelessness, the legislation says a penalty could apply in those circumstances."" Mr Harra also told MPs on the Public Accounts Committee that if his officials at HMRC are asked they would assist the probe into Mr Zahawi. ""If we are asked by the independent adviser on ministerial interests to help with the inquiry, we will do so in any way we possibly can"", the tax boss said. Mr Harra also said that he could not comment on an individual's tax affairs, but signalled that HMRC could potentially offer a more public comment on a minister's tax affairs under certain circumstances. He said: ""Taxpayers can consent for HMRC to share details of their tax affairs with other people and that's normal, for example, when they have an agent. Read More
 ""However, it would still not be normal for HMRC to publicly comment on someone's tax affairs even if they had said that it was OK for us to do so.""  Seizing on the comments the Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper said: ""Rishi Sunak must rule out another Conservative Party stitch up.   ""If Nadhim Zahawi refuses to allow HMRC to assist in this inquiry, Sunak should sack him on the spot.""  “The public are sick and tired of toothless investigations letting Conservative ministers off the hook."" A spokesman for the Prime Minister said: ""I would point back to what the PM said in the House of Commons yesterday which is that he's asked for an investigation to establish the facts in relation to whether there's been a breach of the ministerial code. ""The independent adviser will establish the facts and provide advice to the PM and then he will obviously consider next steps. I obviously can't pre-empt that. It is right that the independent adviser is allowed to continue with that work."" They added that Mr Harra was ""speaking more generally about tax policy"". On Thursday Phillip Hammond - Chancellor during Theresa May's Government - also told Sky News he would not have accepted the role if he was being investigated by the tax office.  ""My own personal view is that I would not want to accept the office of Chancellor if I was at the time involved in a live negotiation of an outstanding tax case with HMRC,"" he said.

'With our pension age rising we need a French lesson to stop the robbing Tories',"In France people have taken to the streets over plans to raise the state pension age to 64, while we risk a hike to 68 and barely whimper, says Paul RoutledgeThe world’s oldest woman, nun Sister Andre, has died aged 118 in the French city of Toulon. They live longer over there, an average of two years. It must be the garlic, the baguettes and the wine.  That same week, one million people took to the streets in France to protest against President Macron ’s plan to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64.  Ooh-la-lah! They should be so lucky.  Here, the pension age of 66 will rise to 67 in five years’ time. And the Tories are plotting to make us wait until 68, possibly as soon as 2033.  Rishi Sunak ’s Great Pensions Robbery, aimed at saving £10billion a year, will hit an entire generation of 50-somethings.  Tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people will never live to get the pension that they’ve paid for. And it comes as the Tories hatch another cunning plan, to get half a million “economically inactive” over-50s and long-term sick back to work. They propose allowing oldies exemption from income tax, and permitting claimants to keep their benefits if they show what work they can do. A policy White Paper has been promised before next month’s Budget. The idea is to incentivise people “who can be, to be in work.” Those who can, must. Both these policies are integral to what I call the Tories’ “scorched earth” strategy, of doing as much harm to the welfare state as they can – before voters dump them in the rubbish bin of history. They know fine well they’re going to lose the next election.  So they want to leave Keir Starmer ’s Labour government a wasteland of bitterness, poverty and unhappiness.  And, unlike the stroppy French, we’re doing nothing about it. ******  Britain, Germany and the US are sending battle tanks to fight the invading Russians in Ukraine.  Our latest contribution comprises 14 Challenger 2 types costing £4.2million each, plus 30 self-propelled AS90 howitzers capable of firing six rounds a minute, with a range of 15 miles. I wouldn’t like to be one of Putin’s conscript army on the receiving end of that firepower.  But of course nothing we do is good enough for Field Marshal Boris Johnson, the self-styled hero of Kyiv. On his latest grand-standing visit to the front, he demanded Ukraine joins NATO now.   He knows it’s impossible as President Zelensky would then invoke Article 5 that requires all to come to the aid of any one attacked. This would take the UK from an undeclared, but real, conflict into all-out war with the nuclear-armed, deluded despot in the Kremlin.  And that is unthinkable, except by those for whom vain, ambition-feeding bluster is more important than rational judgement. ****** A man’s best friend isn’t a dog, it’s a pig. That’s the verdict of scientists in Hungary, who found that porkers are very affectionate. Winston Churchill knew that. “Dogs look up to you, cats look down on you,” he said. “Give me a pig. He looks you in the eye and treats you as an equal.” I like pigs, but experience tells me a man’s best friend is his wife.

Rishi Sunak whisks Cabinet to 'hideaway' as ministers absent from morning TV AGAIN,"The Prime Minister's top team will today meet for an away day at his grace-and-favour country house, Chequers, in Buckinghamshire as pressure mounts over Nadhim Zahawi's tax penaltyUnder-fire Rishi Sunak will today whisk his cabinet out of London in what critics have branded a ""hideaway"" - after failing to put a minister on the airwaves for the third morning this week. Mr Sunak's top team will today meet for an away day at his grace-and-favour country house in Buckinghamshire as pressure mounts over Nadhim Zahawi's tax penalty. Yet again no minister has been offered up to face a grilling on breakfast TV and radio. It is the third time this week that no member of the government has appeared on shows including BBC Breakfast, Good Morning Britain and BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme.  Only police minister Chris Philp has appeared on the broadcast rounds this week as the government swerves tough questions about Mr Sunak's leadership. As The Mirror revealed last year, the government has stopped daily interviews - a move heavily criticised by the opposition - having previously selected a minister to be interviewed on air every day.   The trip to Chequers comes after days of difficult headlines about Mr Zahawi's tax affairs, with the Conservative Party chairman subject to an ethics probe. It is believed Mr Zahawi will be present, but it is not clear whether he will be making a presentation to colleagues about the upcoming local elections. Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride said the result of that investigation, which the Prime Minister announced on Monday, could take just 10 days. It means the conclusions could be on Mr Sunak's desk as early as the tail end of next week. The Cabinet country outing, which Downing Street said would focus on the Prime Minister's political priorities, has been dubbed a ""hideaway day"" by opposition parties. No10 has offered few details about what the away day would entail, but the Prime Minister's official spokesman said Cabinet ministers would be ""focused on the five priority areas"" that Mr Sunak spoke about in his new year's speech.  The Liberal Democrats accused the Cabinet of effectively dodging scrutiny as the country grapples with a range of crises. ""While Rishi Sunak and his scandal-hit ministers hold a 'hideaway' day at Chequers, the rest of the country is suffering from this endless Conservative chaos,"" said Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper.  ""The NHS is in crisis and people are struggling to pay their rent or mortgage, but Conservative ministers are too busy fighting to save their own careers. ""Sunak's promise to govern with integrity now lies in tatters. He can't even tackle the multiple crises facing his Cabinet, let alone the huge challenges facing the country."" Mr Sunak ordered an investigation by Sir Laurie Magnus, his independent adviser on ministers' interests, into whether Mr Zahawi broke ministerial rules over the estimated £4.8 million bill he settled with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) while he was chancellor. Mr Stride, put to him on ITV's Peston programme on Wednesday that rumours suggested the probe could be done within 10 days, said it ""wouldn't be untypical"" for Sir Laurie to operate in that timeframe. He added: ""I can't be drawn on an arrangement of which I don't know all the details. ""But the good news is that we will, in around it sounds like ten days' time or thereabouts, hear from the ethics adviser, who will report to the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister will then have the facts and be able to make exactly those judgments.""  Lord Barwell, who served as Downing Street chief of staff to Theresa May, said the lack of public defence being offered for Mr Zahawi suggested his role could be in jeopardy. The Conservative peer told Channel 4 News: ""I think when you see other ministers not willing to defend a colleague and when you see No 10 confirming that 'we didn't know these facts when the Prime Minister said that', it gives you an indication of which way the wind is blowing."" Asked whether the ""game might be up"", the former MP appeared to nod his head in agreement. Mr Sunak, at Prime Minister's Questions, acknowledged that he had not been given the full picture about the Minister Without Portfolio's financial matters when he told MPs last week that Mr Zahawi had given a ""full"" account. The Prime Minister also said it might be ""politically expedient"" to sack the former vaccines minister, but stressed it was important for ""due process"" to be followed. Trade minister Andrew Bowie insisted Mr Sunak would sack his party chairman if he is found to have broken the ministerial code, but Downing Street said changes to the code meant that would not automatically be the case.

Andrew Bridgen threatens to sue Matt Hancock over Covid vaccine comments row,"North West Leicestershire MP Andrew Bridgen was stripped of the Tory whip after he appeared to compare the effects of coronavirus jabs to the HolocaustBackbencher Andrew Bridgen has said he is suing Matt Hancock after the ex-Health Secretary condemned him for comments about Covid vaccines. Mr Bridgen was stripped of the Tory whip after appearing to compare the effects of coronavirus jabs to the Holocaust. Amid a furore over the comments, Mr Hancock, who lead the Department of Health during the pandemic, raised the issue during Prime Minister's Questions.  He also restated his criticism on Twitter, which is not covered by parliamentary privilege. This protects MPs from being sued for defamation for speeches in the Commons. Mr Bridgen had already threatened legal action against Mr Hancock in relation to the tweet.   The North West Leicestershire MP tweeting that he would ""allow Matt three days to apologise publicy [sic] for calling me an antisemite and racist or he will be contacted by my legal team"". Mr Bridgen has said that he is not antisemitic while also defending his language about the safety of coronavirus vaccines, claiming that his suspension from the Conservative parliamentary party ""says much about the current state of our democracy"". In the days after the original remarks, he also said he was not racist and was ""speaking to a legal team who will commence action against those who have led the call suggesting that I am"".  Mr Bridgen tweeted today: ""I can confirm that Matt Hancock had a legal letter before action from Bad Law Team on my behalf regarding defamation on Monday.""  The legal action is being supported by the Reclaim Party and the Bad Law Project, which is linked to Reclaim Party leader Laurence Fox, claims to oppose ""political ideology disguised as law"". A spokesperson for Mr Hancock said: ""What Matt said was obviously not libellous and he stands by his comments. ""Rather than wasting his time and money on an absurd libel case he will undoubtedly lose, let's hope Bridgen does the right thing and apologises for the hurt he's caused and keeps his offensive view to himself in future.""

Tory MP Jonathan Gullis branded 'pound shop Farage' over missing children heckle,"Former schools minister Jonathan Gullis is accused of saying migrant children feared to have been snatched by criminals """"shouldn't have come here illegally""A Tory MP has been branded ""loathsome"" after saying missing migrant children feared to have been snatched by criminals ""shouldn't have come here illegally"".  Jonathan Gullis made the ""loathsome"" remark while heckling a Labour member who raised the plight of 200 unaccompanied youngsters yesterday.  The 33-year-old former Schools Minister was today branded a ""pound shop Farage"" and accused of using ""dehumanising language toward asylum seekers"". He has been widely condemned on social media after Shadow Northern Ireland secretary Peter Kyle shared the comment, which was shouted as Labour's Tulip Siddiq questioned Rishi Sunak. Mr Kyle posted on Twitter: ""Tulip Sadiq asks the prime minister about the welfare of 200 unaccompanied migrant children who’ve gone missing.  ""Tory MP Jonathan Gullis heckles ‘well they shouldn’t have come here illegally’. Just when you think you’ve heard it all, the Tory Party find a new low.""    Today leader of the House of Commons, Penny Mordaunt, was urged to condemn the remark. SNP Commons leader Deidre Brock fumed: ""A member on the benches opposite, who is clearly bent on establishing himself as some kind of Conservative Party pound shop (Nigel) Farage, reportedly shouted something really loathsome yesterday at PMQs about the 200 asylum-seeking children that are allegedly missing. ""It was so despicable I won't repeat it, but its content must be known to her through the outrage on social media. Will she join me in condemning his remarks, which by victim blaming potentially 200 missing vulnerable children, marks a new low in dehumanising language towards asylum seekers?""  This afternoon Mr Gullis did not deny the comment, instead attacking Labour on migration. It comes after minister Robert Jenrick admitted 200 asylum-seeking children who were placed in hotels run by the Home Office are missing. At the weekend the Observer reported that a whistleblower from a Home Office hotel in Brighton said some children had been abducted off the street and bundled into cars.  Mr Jenrick said he had ""not been presented with evidence that that has happened"" but will continue to investigate.  Ms Mordaunt said: ""One of the very sad things about the system at the moment, and we recognise that it is a broken system that needs reform, and we are bringing legislation forward to tackle that, but keeping people in hotels for long periods of time increases their vulnerability. ""We've had stories of gangmasters turning up at hotels that they know asylum seekers are staying at, taking people away. It is for very obvious reasons very hard to protect people in that kind of environment. So we have to address this. ""And I do hope that when we do bring forward legislation to tackle this issue, to get the system to work more effectively, make it fairer for both the UK taxpayer but also for those very vulnerable people who are being trafficked, we will have support from all sides of this House. ""This is a serious matter, people need protecting, and we must do so swiftly."" During an exchange at PMQs yesterday, Ms Siddiq said: ""Ministers have admitted that they have no idea about the whereabouts of those children. Does the Prime Minister think that the UK is still a safe haven for vulnerable children?"" In response Mr Sunak said it was ""concerning"", and continued: ""Local authorities have a statutory duty to protect all children regardless of where they go missing from, and in that situation they work closely with local agencies, including the police, to establish their whereabouts.  ""That is why it is so important that we end the use of hotels for unaccompanied asylum seekers and reduce pressure on the overall system. That is what our plans will do."" In response to a query about the comment, Mr Gullis did not deny saying it, instead saying in a statement: ""Labour’s open door approach to illegal immigration shows they’re out of touch with the public, out of ideas on migration, and explains why they’ve been out of government for over a decade.  ""I fully support the Prime Minister in stopping migrants claiming asylum who have entered the UK illegally, deporting them to safe third countries like Rwanda instead, and smash apart the vile smuggling gangs.""

Tory plan to woo stay-at-home mums back to work branded 'insulting',"Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride is reportedly plotting moves to encourage stay-at-home mums to return to the office, including an advertising blitz and a letter writing campaignMinisters have been accused of ""insulting"" mums with plans for a new drive to woo stay-at-home parents back to work. Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride is reportedly plotting moves to encourage stay-at-home mums to return to the office, including an advertising blitz and a letter writing campaign. The proposal comes as part of Tory efforts to get people back into work and boost lagging productivity. A Whitehall source told the Sun: “Mel has been taking a fresh look at the whole system since becoming Secretary of State and isn’t afraid to shake things up. “Part of that involves examining the structure of Universal Credit as it stands and understanding how barriers or disincentives can be reduced or removed to ensure as many people as possible who can work - do.” However the report triggered fury from critics who said the way to help stay-at-home parents was a major overhaul to the UK's complex and costly childcare system.   Rishi Sunak has shelved plans Liz Truss's plans for ""big bang"" childcare reforms, which were due to include increasing free childcare support by 20 hours a week and scrapping staff to child ratios. CBI chief Tony Danker warned this week that parents are being forced to limit the hours they work because affordable childcare is not available. A Government source told the Mirror that there were efforts to engage with the non-working partners of in-work Universal Credit claimants as the benefit is claimed on a household basis, rather than individuals. But the source denied that stay-at-home mums were being specifically targeted. Labour MP Stella Creasy tweeted: ""Things that get mums into work: a) affordable childcare b) flexible working c) tackling discrimination. ""Things that don't a) letters from Ministers who have fail to provide any of the above. ""Stop insulting mums. Start listening to them!"" A Labour source added: “This is more evidence of a tired government that’s run out of ideas and has zero ambition for women across this country. ""Tory tinkering around the edges will not deliver for women but Labour’s modern childcare system will give all parents, and particularly women, choices about getting back into the workplace as well as the growth our economy needs."" Brett Wigdortz, founder of TeachFirst and CEO of early years initiative tiney, said: ""The DWP's plan to get 'stay-at-home mothers' to re-enter the workforce through adverts and letters overlooks a crucial factor: childcare costs are swallowing up incomes and leaving work has become a necessity for many parents - not a choice. ""Government focus should be on introducing sensible reforms to reduce the financial burden childcare presents to most parents whilst also making the market sustainable for providers."" Labour is expected to put childcare at the heart of its election offer. Shadow Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is understood to be drawing up plans for major expansion of free childcare that could be worth around £6billion a year.

Unpaid taxes rose by £5billion in Nadhim Zahawi's three months as chancellor,"The Liberal Democrats, who uncovered the figures, accused the Tories of 'allowing eye-watering amounts of taxes to go unpaid while our local health services are left desperately underfunded and overstretched'The value of unpaid taxes grew by almost £5billion during Nadhim Zahawi’s brief stint as Chancellor. The Liberal Democrats, who uncovered the figures, accused the Tories of ""allowing eye-watering amounts of taxes to go unpaid"" whilst the ""underfunded"" NHS struggles to cope. HMRC data shows that the value of unpaid taxes owed grew to a whopping £47billion in the three months between July and September 2022. This is an increase of £4.9 billion on the previous quarter - the equivalent of £54million a day. This would be enough to pay for around 150,000 more nurses or over 33,000 more doctors. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney said: “This Conservative government is allowing eye-watering amounts of taxes to go unpaid while our local health services are left desperately underfunded and overstretched. “Families around the country who work hard and play by the rules will be rightly furious to see billions of pounds in taxes being poured down the drain.   “It’s little wonder the Conservatives are failing to crack down on those failing to pay their fair share, when Nadhim Zahawi spent his time as chancellor negotiating his own settlement with HMRC. “Every day brings a steady drip drip of sleaze and scandal, while families pay the price for this endless Conservative chaos.” Boris Johnson appointed Mr Zahawi as chancellor in July last year as he desperately fought to cling onto his job. When Liz Truss became PM in September, she moved him to a role in the Cabinet Office. During his time at the Treasury, former businessman Mr Zahawi paid a settlement, thought to have been around £5million, to the taxman to end a dispute over his bill. It included a reported penalty for not paying the right amount to start with.  The PM has ordered his ethics adviser to look into the matter, including whether the minister has told the truth about the matter. Despite the probe he has been allowed to remain in post. The head of HMRC this morning suggested Mr Zahawi has not made an “innocent error” in his tax affairs. Jim Harra told MPs on the Public Accounts Committee this morning that “there are no penalties for innocent errors in your tax affairs”. He said: “I am not commenting on any particular person’s affairs but carelessness is a concept in tax law. It can be relevant to how many back years that we can assess and it can be relevant to whether someone is liable to a penalty and if so, what penalty they will be liable to for an error in their tax affairs. “There are no penalties for innocent errors in your tax affairs. So if you take reasonable care, but nevertheless make a mistake, whilst you will be liable for the tax and for interest if it’s paid late, you would not be liable for a penalty. “But if your error was as a result of carelessness, then legislation says that a penalty could apply in those circumstances.” * Follow Mirror Politics on Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter and Facebook.

The Mirror revealed in November Mr Raab has been nicknamed “The Incinerator” because he “burns through” staff so quickly. Officials working for him accused him of creating a “climate of fear” in the Ministry of Justice.  Mr Raab was ousted from the department when Liz Truss became PM, but he returned just seven weeks later when Mr Sunak entered No10 last month.  Government sources said concerns had been raised about the turnover of staff in roles working closely with the minister.   Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner last night said: “These shocking claims of widespread bullying and intimidation raise yet more questions about the Prime Minister’s judgement.   ""He promised a government of integrity and claimed zero tolerance for bullying, yet he not only appointed Dominic Raab as his Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary but continues to prop him up.  ""The Cabinet he appointed is awash with sleaze and scandal, but the Prime Minister is too weak to do anything about it. There must be no whitewash, and the Prime Minister himself must come clean on what he knew when he reappointed Dominic Raab.” An MoJ spokesman said: “There is zero tolerance for bullying across the civil service. The deputy prime minister leads a professional department, driving forward major reforms, where civil servants are valued and the level of ambition is high. “There is an independent investigation under way and it would be inappropriate to comment further on issues relating to it until it is completed.”  Follow Mirror Politics on    Snapchat   ,    Tiktok   ,    Twitter   and    Facebook   .

Inside UK town so poor 'children have no shoes' and parents turn to loan sharks,"The seaside town of Withernsea, East Yorkshire, relies on seasonal trade and has seen good times in the past but families have cut trips to the coast as their budgets bite and the town strugglesA UK town is so poor some kids have 'no shoes' and parents are turning to predatory loan sharks to survive. The cost of living crisis has impacted many but their plight of many has been an opportunity for an unscrupulous few. The seaside town of Withernsea, East Yorkshire, relies on seasonal trade and has seen good times in the past. But HullLive reports families have cut trips to the coast as their budgets bite and the town struggles for survival. In October, the local South Holderness Resource Centre (SHoREs) organisation reported demand for its discount social supermarket had rocketed amid double-digital inflation.    And councillors heard the area was scheduled to have a trial campaign to stop people from going to loan sharks and illegal lenders. Paul Bellotti communities director said East Riding of Yorkshire Council would try to signpost people away from illegal lenders and to proper creditors amid fears loan sharks could prey on the desperate. Officials had seen heart-breaking conditions among those coming to the council while around 4,000 people are expected to seek help with financial advisers by March. Resident John Taggart was coping well but added he felt sorry for others in the town who were struggling. The 63-year-old said: ""I'd never go to one of those lenders myself but with the way things are I can see why people do.  ""I'm from Leeds originally and over there they have shops that people take their TVs and things to and they use them to get a loan. ""The shop keeps them and if the person doesn't pay back in a week the TV or whatever it is they've put down gets taken away and they sell them. ""It would be terrible to be in that situation. Personally I'm all right at the moment, the only thing I'm trying to sort out is a house. ""I've lived in a holiday caravan ever since I moved here but now I'm looking for a house, but I just can't get one. ""That's the only thing I want right now luckily for me, when I get that I'll be happy for the rest of my life. I was a publican by trade and I've been here for 32 years, things are very different now.  ""With the pubs alone you had lockdown and now you've got the price of everything going up. You can see the effects everywhere, I look at some of the kids around here and I feel sorry for them, their shoes are hanging off their feet. ""If I was a billionaire I'd love to help them out. But there's nothing I or anyone here can do for them."" Leslie Pettican, 69, said he and his wife had looked forward to their retirement in the town, only to be hit by high inflation. Mr Pettican said: ""Hearing people take about illegal lenders makes me worry about the way things are going. ""I wouldn't do it but it's just sticking a carrot in front of people who need money, if they're desperate they might not think about the consequences.  ""My wife and I are finding it hard, we've had to cut down because of the energy and food prices going up. ""I don't watch the news very much but I do know for more and more people the choice is between heating and eating. I know because we've had to make that choice ""I retired in 2019, we live in a caravan in one of the local holiday parks which was always a holiday home, we were looking forward to a nice retirement by the seaside. ""We manage though, we just go to the cheaper shops, I think the attitude towards it's a generational thing. ""You've just got to try and get on with things. Because the more you think about it the worse it makes you feel."" Caroline, who has always lived in Withernsea, said she was shocked at how much prices had risen and at the toll it was taking on the town. She said: ""Thankfully it's not something I've ever had to do, but in times like these when you've got single parents or families with little ones who are struggle and have nowhere else to go you can easily see it happening. ""No one benefits from having to do that, but we're not a rich town and if you don't have money you can't spend it.  ""I think everyone's struggling right now, mostly with just trying to keep warm. ""Everything is miles, miles more expensive and it feels like so many places are closing down and up for sale. ""I've never known the cost of things to go up so quickly as they have in the past year, even things like a loaf of bread and a pound of butter. ""This time of year's usually not great and there's normally not a lot of people around anyway, but I don't know how it will be come summer. ""Last year seemed better than I expected, we had some cracking weather so loads of people came to the beach. ""The trouble is there wasn't many people in shops though, they didn't seem to be spending as much. But I don't know what things will be like this year, we'll have to see. ""For us you either heat or you eat right now. We have less luxuries so we can have more gas, simple as."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/inside-uk-town-poor-children-29055967
Sale and possession of laughing gas may be made illegal in 'hippy crack' clampdown,"A Home Office source told The Mirror that a crackdown on nitrous oxide, known as ""hippy crack"" is being weighed up by ministers - with drug laws expected to be updated later this yearSale and possession of laughing gas could be outlawed under new plans to tackle antisocial behaviour, the government is set to announce. A Home Office source told The Mirror that a crackdown on nitrous oxide, known as ""hippy crack"" is being weighed up by ministers - with drug laws expected to be updated later this year. This could see people found in possession of the drug face up to two years in jail or an unlimited fine, or 14 years for supplying it. The drug's popularity has soared in recent years, which more than 500,000 young people using it in 2019-20, according to government figures. It has been linked to 36 deaths between 2001 and 2016. If new laws are approved, those found with the substance face prosecution unless they have a 'legitimate reason' - for example chefs, who use it for whipped cream and chilling food. Under current laws the 'knowing or reckless supply' of nitrous oxide - which can also be used for pain relief - is banned.   Policing minister Chris Philp is reportedly pushing for an ongoing review of nitrous oxide by the independent Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs to be fast-tracked to April. It has been suggested that the formal announcement of a ban could be made as part of the Government's antisocial behaviour strategy due later this year. The Prime Minister addressed the issue in his new year's speech earlier this month, hitting out at antisocial behaviour and highlighting the blight of discarded ""nitrous oxide canisters in children's playgrounds"". A source told The Times: “There is a clear view that we have to act.  “There is a clear link between the use of nitrous oxide and antisocial behaviour and this is a top priority for the government.”  In a speech earlier this month, Rishi Sunak said: “Strong communities are also built on values, on the golden rule: treat others as you would like to be treated. “But too often, a small minority break that golden rule. “They spray graffiti on war memorials, discard needles and nitrous oxide canisters in children’s playgrounds, gang together and cause disorder and disruption. “Anti-social behaviour isn’t inevitable or a minor crime. It makes life miserable for so many and it can be a gateway to more extreme crimes. “So this Government will work tirelessly to crack down on anti-social behaviour, giving police forces, mayors and local authorities the tools they need and giving communities confidence that these crimes will be quickly and visibly punished.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/sale-possession-laughing-gas-made-29054115
Inside 'baby bank' where desperate mums who can't afford nappies or clothes turn,"A 'baby bank' in London is helping desperate parents who cannot afford basic necessities for their children including nappies, clothes and toys. Volunteers expect 2023 to be even busier than 2022Struggling families have told how they can’t afford basics like nappies, winter clothes and toys for their children amid the cost of living crisis. The Mirror visited a “baby bank” which supplies thousands of parents struggling to make ends meet with bare essentials for under fives Little Village - one of around 200 baby banks across Britain - supported 7006 children in 2022 in their busiest year yet. With demand skyrocketing thanks to soaring food and utility bills, volunteers who lovingly wash, sort and hand out pre-loved kit and baby clothes expect 2023 to be even busier. When they come to Little Village, new mums usually leave with a bundle which would cost them around £1000 brand new. “It’s just not achievable,” spokesperson Emma Gibbs told the Mirror. “It’s an awful dilemma that families find themselves in.” One mum visited their Hackney branch to collect essentials for her second child, due next month.   The mum, 44, and her husband have fallen on hard times after health complications during her pregnancy forced her to stop work. She was referred for support by her midwife who was worried about her welfare. “I didn’t want to tell anyone that I wasn’t ready,” she told the Mirror. “When I was pregnant with my daughter I was working so I didn’t need anything. “Previously I would always put food in the charity basket at the shopping centre. But now I need it. I can’t believe how much things have changed for me. “Putting on the heater is a problem - so how can I buy some baby clothes? Even food is now expensive. “I only turn my heating on for 20 minutes then I have to turn it off. When my daughter goes to sleep I put a hot water bottle on the bed to keep her warm.”  Mum-of-two Bibi Aisha, 33, from Tower Hamlets, has no recourse to public funds while her asylum application is pending. Biba, who arrived from Bangladesh in 2014, is also reliant on food banks to feed her family. “The queue is so long now and there is little food left,” she told the Mirror. She said Little Village was the only way she could get any toys for her kids, aged three and five. A mum-of-three, who also volunteers at the baby bank, told how her family of five struggle to sleep in one bed in their cramped bedsit.  Despite begging the housing authority for better accommodation for her kids aged five, three and six months, two of which are diagnosed with autism, she has been trapped in the tiny flat for seven years. Fighting back tears, she told the Mirror: “My son wakes up and doesn’t go back to sleep, so he wakes up the other kids. I go everywhere and I am tired."" Tinah Nsemerizwe, 35, from Islington, told the Mirror she has a back problem from sharing a bed with her two daughters, aged five and eight. “At Christmas I was struggling to get them presents,” she added. “Sometimes I have to go without so we can pay the bills and eat. “Kids’ stuff is expensive and sometimes you have to sacrifice. You don’t want them to feel different.”  She left the baby bank with a much-needed winter coat for her five-year-old. “She is going to be so excited,” she added. Sophie Livingstone, CEO of Little Village, said the charity supported 40% more children year on year from 2021 to 2022. In 2023, they expect to support 9,000 children. Demand is now so high they have had to introduce a weekly limit for referrals as they are at capacity.  “We have a weekly cap for referrals and when that cap is reached we close referrals for the week,” she told the Mirror. “We are reaching that cap earlier and earlier each week.” And in the face of soaring demand the charity has also seen a drop off in donations, as many families opt to resell bigger items like cots buggies rather than donate them. “We can only fulfil about half of the big kit requests because we don’t have the items,” she added.  Calling for action to tackle the poverty crisis, she said: “The country is in total catastrophe and it doesn’t feel like the government has recognised that. “The safety net has got too many holes in it. People are really falling through it now.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/inside-babybank-desperate-mums-who-29053898
Labour vows Britain's steel industry will have a 'bright future' if it gets into power,"Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds pledged to help the steel industry go green as he gathered the bosses of firms and trade union representatives for a summitBritain's steel industry will have a “bright future” if Labour gets into power, Jonathan Reynolds has vowed. The Shadow Business Secretary gathered industry leaders and trade union representatives this morning to discuss the future of steel in this country. The new group is expected to meet regularly to talk about the vital role the sector plays in the national economy, the challenges it faces and what is required to make the UK a global leader in green steel. At the first meeting today, Mr Reynolds recommitted to Labour’s pledge to partner with industry to invest in the green steel the UK needs to remain competitive. The shadow business secretary said: “It is clear industry needs a partner in government that not only understands the challenges our steel producers are facing now but has the vision to invest in the future.   “Steel is a foundational sector integral to our national security and ability to transition to net zero. “Labour will invest £3billion alongside industry to ensure the next generation of green steel is built in the UK. Steel has a bright future under Labour.” Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the steelworkers’ union Community, said: “Britain needs a strong steel industry for a prosperous and resilient economy, to deliver net zero, for our national security, and to safeguard high quality jobs in places that really need them. “We must have strong social partnerships in place to protect foundational industries like steel, and this roundtable which brought together steel companies, unions and political leaders, demonstrates the best way forward. “Steelworkers had enough of warm words – we need action. The Government and the employers must now play their part to protect our steel industry.”  Gareth Stace, director general of UK Steel, said: “The UK steel sector faces many challenges in the years ahead, not least in the complete decarbonisation of production in little more than a decade’s time. “This requires a shared long-term vision and policy certainty. We therefore hugely welcome this opportunity to meet with Labour to discuss our vision for a net-zero steel industry, and what support is necessary to deliver it. “The future of UK steel production is one of critical strategic importance to the country. It is therefore essential to work with all parties to secure this national asset for decades to come.” The Mirror has been campaigning to Save Our Steel. The industry, which is worth £2.4billion to the economy, supports 39,000 jobs in Britain.  * Follow Mirror Politics on Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter and Facebook.

Tories 'reach new level of cruelty' as minister says CHILDREN could be sent to Rwanda,"Immigration minister Robert Jenrick today said no decision had been reached on whether families with children should be deported under the controversial Rwanda project - but hinted the government favours the moveThe Tories have been accused of ""new levels of cruelty and heartlessness"" after a minister refused to rule out deporting children to Rwanda. MPs today heard that the Home Office is considering sending families to central Africa under the controversial scheme. Critics say such a move would be ""a stain on our government's conscience"". Immigration minister Robert Jenrick claimed that refusing to send children to the central African country would prompt traffickers to ""focus"" on smuggling families into the UK instead. Facing cross-party MPs at the Women and Equalities Committee this afternoon, he hinted that the government may favour deporting whole families.   Mr Jenrick said: ""The balance that we need to consider is the challenge of minors leaving the country to Rwanda against the risk of the UK becoming a magnet for traffickers focusing on families. I think that's a very real concern if the Rwanda policy was fully operationalised. ""I wouldn't want to see a situation where adult males were deterred from coming to the UK as a result of the Rwanda policy but the people smugglers continued their operations with a particular focus on families. ""I think there's a range of risks as a result of that."" He clarified, however, that unaccompanied minors would not face being deported to Rwanda. Pressed by Tory MP Caroline Nokes, he said: ""We haven't come to a firm conclusion but I think I've explained the thinking that we're going though... we wouldn't want to replace a trade in adult trace in adult males with a trade in families."" Mark Davies, head of communications and campaigns at the Refugee Council, told The Mirror: ""All the evidence shows the scheme is unworkable and that it poses serious safeguarding risks, particularly for children.   ""We have a moral and legal obligation to protect children who have fled war, persecution and oppression. It's wrong to treat vulnerable children like human cargo and we urge ministers not to do so."" Following the exchange, Lib Dem Home Affairs spokesperson Alistair Carmichael said: ""At the heart of these channel crossings are stories of intense suffering and human tragedy that no one, especially a child, should face. ""To send even one child across the world after what they've already been through would be a stain on our government's conscience.  ""By refusing to rule out deporting families to Rwanda, this Conservative Government has reached new levels of cruelty and heartlessness.""  Mr Jenrick said the government remains committed to its deportation project, saying he wants to see departures ""as soon as possible"". But critics have rubbished the programme, which has already seen the UK pay £140 million to the Rwandan government without a single plane taking off. Mr Carmichael said: ""The Conservatives’ Rwanda asylum plan is immoral, ineffective and incredibly costly for taxpayers. It will do nothing to stop dangerous Channel crossings or combat people smuggling and human trafficking; instead it will give criminal gangs more power and profits.  ""Yet again, the Conservatives are refusing to acknowledge that the best way to stop human trafficking is by providing safe and legal routes to sanctuary."" The government claims flying asylum seekers to Kigali will act as a deterrent to small boat crossings, but a report by cross-party MPs said there was no evidence to support this. Last week campaigners hoping to torpedo the plan were handed a boost after top judges ruled the matter could be heard by the Court of Appeal. Several organisations, including Care4Calais, had applied for the right to appeal. Last week Clare Moseley, the founder of the refugee charity said: ""We remain committed to ensuring that no person who has suffered the horrors of war, torture and human rights abuses will be forcibly deported to Rwanda where their safety cannot be guaranteed. “The people we work with in Calais come from countries such as Afghanistan, Iran, Syria and Sudan that have asylum acceptance rates that are as high as 82 - 98%. ""They are people who have escaped from the very worst things in this world and they urgently need our help."" Ms Moseley continued: ""The Rwanda plan won’t end small boat crossings, it won’t stop people smugglers and it won’t keep refugees safe. There is a kinder and more effective way; giving safe passage to refugees in Calais.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tories-reach-new-level-cruelty-29049320
No10 says Rishi Sunak has never paid a tax penalty after Labour says come clean,"Earlier today the Prime Minister's press secretary repeatedly refused to answer questions over whether Rishi Sunak had ever been asked to pay a penalty by HMRC like under-fire Tory Nadhim Zahawi - but later clarified that he hadn'tNo10 has confirmed that Rishi Sunak has never paid a tax penalty after facing pressure in the backlash over Nadhim Zahawi. Earlier today the Prime Minister's press secretary repeatedly refused to answer the question, saying that an individual's tax arrangements ""confidential"". No10 was also unable to say whether Mr Sunak is confident no more damaging surprises will emerge about Mr Zahawi's tax affairs. But in a brief statement this evening, Downing Street clarified: “The Prime Minister has never paid a penalty to HMRC.” Keir Starmer branded Mr Sunak ""hopelessly weak"" for failing to sack his party chairman over the row, which erupted when Mr Zahawi admitted he had resolved a multimillion pound tax dispute with HMRC while he was Chancellor last summer. The Tory chairman said a ""careless but not deliberate"" error had been made, relating to shares in YouGov, the polling company he co-founded before he became an MP.  In a statement at the weekend, Mr Zahawi also confirmed he had agreed to a settlement, which is estimated to be worth around £5million, including a penalty.   Mr Sunak initially stood by him but on Monday he ordered his ethics chief to launch a probe in a desperate bid to stamp out the growing scandal.  He is now facing questions over his failure to sack the Tory minister. This afternoon Downing Street was repeatedly asked if Mr Sunak had ever paid a penalty to HMRC like Mr Zahawi but failed to answer. The PM's press secretary said: ""You wouldn't expect me to get into the Prime Minister's tax affairs, they are confidential. ""The tax affairs of an individual, irrespective of who they are, are confidential."" Mr Sunak will publish his tax return ""in due course"" but the press secretary would not commit to the publishing of six years of the PM's tax returns, as David Cameron did. Asked by the Mirror if Mr Sunak should answer the question, a Labour spokesperson said: ""Yes."" The spokesperson said he would find out if Keir Starmer had paid a penalty and make that public. It comes as Tory MP Nigel Mills said Mr Zahawi's position ""won't be tenable"" unless he can explain the penalty. He told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: “I think the only way to resolve this is to make clear what the situation was that gave rise to a significant penalty and if that can be explained innocently we’ll move on and if it can’t then his position won’t be tenable”. Asked about whether the matter should be resolved in public, he said: “I can’t see how he can do his job of party chairman when the key thing is to go on the media and defend the government and explain the government’s position which he can’t do at the moment… It’s in his interest to come out and make a complete statement and then we can make a decision one way or another.""

"Half of children not 'developmentally' ready to start primary school, survey shows","Some children are turning having been toilet trained or having basic language skills - as teachers say parents are spending too much time on their electronic devices could be a factorParents are struggling to ensure their children are ready to start school, teachers have warned. Almost half of child pupils beginning primary school are not “developmentally” ready with some not having been toilet trained or having basic language skills. Nearly three-quarters of leaders are concerned parents are spending too much time on their phones and tablets, while 66% say the pandemic still plays a part. It compares to 89% of parents believing their child was ready for school. Teachers noted that many parents are simply unaware of teachers’ expectations. More than half of parents said more information on the definition and importance of school readiness should be provided.  The findings come from a survey of 1,000 primary school teachers and 1,000 parents of reception-age children, which was carried out by YouGov and commissioned by children’s charity Kindred. It found staff are being taken away from other priorities for around 2-3 hours per day to deal with pupils who aren’t school ready. A senior teacher from the West Midlands told the survey: “Teachers often can’t get down to the ‘meat and potatoes’ of teaching the curriculum because they're doing things like changing wet children, dealing with emotional outbreaks. “Many of our reception staff, especially this autumn term, have missed out on their lunches and thus their prep time due to supporting children who can’t feed themselves.” A teacher from London said: “It’s very hard to get children back on track and they stay ‘below’ throughout their time at school, despite our best efforts with intervention.”  Felicity Gillespie, director at Kindred, said: “Too many children are behind before they begin because as a nation we are not prioritising the raising of children at the very time in their lives when their brains are most receptive to stimulation and interaction with older children and adults. She added: “We need a national conversation about the importance of the early years of development. And as a first step, we need clear, timely and accessible information on the simple, easy steps every parent can be taking from the birth of their babies to support their development.” James Bowen, director of policy for school leaders’ union the NAHT, said: “Even before the pandemic, there was lack of specialist help for families with issues such as their children’s social development, speech and language. “The pandemic and lockdowns have undoubtedly had an impact on the development of some children and led to additional demand being placed on already overstretched services. “The government needs to invest much more in specialist and universal early years services for disadvantaged families and massively expand its new network of family hubs so all families that need them have access.”  Follow Mirror Politics on    Snapchat   ,    Tiktok   ,    Twitter   and    Facebook.

Universal Covid jabs to be wound down as under-50s given just weeks to get boosters,"JCVI bosses issued the fresh guidance as they revealed that the universal Covid vaccine programme would end this year - and urged healthy Brits who haven't had their booster to get jabbed while they have a chanceThe universal Covid jabs programme is being wound down as healthy under-50s are told they have only weeks left to get their booster. The UK's vaccine chiefs recommended new boosters for vulnerable Brits in the Autumn and extra jabs for the most at-risk, such as the elderly and immunosuppressed, in the Spring. But the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises the Government, also said boosters for people aged 16 to 49-years-old who are not at risk should come to an end. People in England who haven't had their booster are being urged to take it up before the scheme ends on February 12.  Some 17.3 million people - or two thirds of the 26 million eligible - have had their booster, according to NHS England figures. The JCVI also said that the universal offer of the primary course of the vaccine - the first and second jabs - should be replaced with ""a more targeted offer during vaccination campaigns"". Currently, Brits over the age of 5-years-old can get their first and second jabs at walk-in centres or through the NHS booking service. No date has been set for the end of the universal programme but it will happen at some point during 2023.   The NHS in England said that until the universal programme ends, it will continue to operate a ""smaller scale"" vaccine offer from mid-February onwards to ensure those eligible for first and second doses can still get their jabs. Officials have stressed that if people are newly deemed to be clinically at risk, they will still be able to get vaccinated. People who will be eligible for their first jabs in a new targeted programme will be:  care home residents and workers frontline health and social care workers adults over 50 people who are clinically at risk carers and people who live in a house where someone is immunosuppressed.  The JCVI said the move comes ""as the transition continues away from a pandemic emergency response towards pandemic recovery"". It said that there were high uptake rates for the initial booster - most people's third jab - when it was first offered in December 2021. But take-up rates have plummeted since then to as low as ""less than 0.1% per week since April 2022 in all eligible people under 50 years of age"". Similarly, uptake of the primary course vaccination - the first two jabs - has ""plateaued"" in recent months across all age groups, the JCVI said. Steve Russell, director of vaccinations and screening at NHS England, said: ""Following the decision by the Government to accept JCVI advice today, I would encourage anyone who has not yet had their Covid booster to book an appointment in the next couple of weeks and make the most of the offer available.  ""Once the NHS receives updated guidance for the next phase of the vaccination programme, our fantastic NHS staff will make sure the vaccine is as accessible and convenient to those eligible as it has been in each of the previous campaigns."" Officials have also been advised that they may need an ""emergency surge vaccine response"" if a new variant emerges. Professor Wei Shen Lim, chair of Covid-19 vaccination on the JCVI, said: ""The Covid-19 vaccination programme continues to reduce severe disease across the population, while helping to protect the NHS. ""That is why we have advised planning for further booster vaccines for persons at higher risk of serious illness through an autumn booster programme later this year. ""We will very shortly also provide final advice on a spring booster programme for those at greatest risk."" Health Minister Maria Caulfield confirmed that the Government had accepted the advice across the UK. She said: ""In England, the 2021 booster offer (third dose) for persons aged 16 to 49 years who are not in a clinical risk group will end in alignment with the close of the autumn 2022 campaign in England on 12 February 2023.  ""The JCVI’s advice to target the initial vaccination (primary course) offer to those at higher risk from Covid-19 has been accepted by HMG subject to further consideration of timings.""

Keir Starmer ridicules 'weak' Rishi Sunak for failing to sack Tory chair Nadhim Zahawi,"The Labour leader blasted the Prime Minister saying he is 'overseeing chaos' and 'overwhelmed at every turn' as the Tory Chairman fights to keep his role in the Cabinet Keir Starmer has ridiculed ""hopelessly weak"" Rishi Sunak for failing to sack the Tory Chairman Nadhim Zahawi amid a row over his tax affairs.

Mr Sunak suggested the ""politically expedient"" option would have been to sack Mr Zahawi, who failed to appear at PMQs, but added: ""I believe in proper due process.""

Just last week Mr Sunak stood by the Tory Chairman and told MPs that Mr Zahawi had ""already addressed this matter in full"". Read More
  But on Monday he was forced to order his ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus to investigate the Cabinet minister amid a row over the party chair's tax affairs. In a bruising Prime Minister's Questions today, Mr Sunak tried to pass the buck by saying the issue occurred before he was appointed Prime Minister. ""No issues were raised with me when he was appointed to his role and since I commented on this matter last week more information has come forward and that is why I have asked the independent adviser to look into the matter. ""I obviously can't pre-judge the outcome of that"". The PM also accused Labour of ""simple political opportunism"" for urging him to appoint an ethics advisor then wanting a decision before the adviser had investigated the case. No10 was later unable to say that Mr Sunak is confident no more damaging surprises will emerge about Mr Zahawi's tax affairs.  The Prime Minister's press secretary said: ""I don't think any of us can predict what may come up but I think he's confident now he's put the right process in place and the independent adviser is looking into it.""  Downing Street also indicated Mr Sunak received assurances about Mr Zahawi's tax affairs before defending him at Prime Minister's questions last Wednesday. The Tory chairman said at the weekend a ""careless but not deliberate"" error had been made and he had agreed to a settlement to fix it, estimated to be around £5million, including a penalty. But some Tories, including ex-minister Caroline Nokes, have called on Mr Zahawi to stand down as party chair while the probe is carried out. Earlier on Monday the ex-Tory Cabinet Minister David Gauke said the PM should “encourage” him to resign ahead of what will be a “very uncomfortable” PMQs. The former MP said it was “hard to see” how the row “doesn’t ultimately end” in him stepping down as Tory chairman.

"Tories on verge of breaking key pledge to recruit 20,000 police officers by March","Figures released today by the Home Office reveal the government must recruit a massive 3,427 officers by the end of March, amid fears low pay is putting off would-be coppersTories are on the verge of breaking their election promise to recruit 20,000 new police officers by 2010 - amid warnings that a real-terms pay drop is putting off would-be coppers. Latest Home Office figures reveal that a massive 3,427 officers still need to be recruited by the end of March in order to meet Boris Johnson's 2019 pledge. It comes after years of Tory austerity which sent police numbers plummeting. Last week a watchdog chief warned MPs that bringing in new officers was proving difficult, with coppers having suffered a 20% real-terms pay reduction since 2010, when the Tories came to power. Data from the Home Office shows 16,753 police have joined under the Police Uplift Programme - 16% short of the promised number. But it says it is ""well on its way"" to meeting the target by March 31.   In order to do this, the government will need to recruit 1,142 officers per month - having averaged 494 over the past six months. But this could prove tricky. Last week Andy Cooke, Chief Inspector of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue, told MPs that bringing officer numbers back to 2010 levels was ""an issue"". He told the Home Affairs Committee: ""Now trying to get back to these police officer numbers is an issue. ""I'd add on top of that that police officers in real terms have basically had a 20% pay cut in 2010 compared to what they earn now. ""So policing isn't a vastly attractive proposition, particularly in areas where there's a high cost of living."" A House of Commons Library research paper published last month states that in 2010 there were 172,000 police officers across the UK, including Scotland and Northern Ireland. This steadily dipped over the next decade, reaching 150,000 in 2017 before slowly starting to rise. By last year there were 164,000.  Today Yvette Cooper MP, Labour’s Shadow Home Secretary, said:""The Conservatives are totally failing to keep communities safe. It shows how badly they have managed policing over the last 13 years that more officers are leaving than joining and they are on course to miss their police recruitment target. ""On their watch, police numbers have been slashed, experienced officers have been lost, neighbourhoods feel less safe and communities have been put at risk. ""The next Labour government will rebuild neighbourhood policing with 13,000 new officers and PCSOs to cut crime at source and protect communities."" Lib Dem Home Affairs spokesperson Alistair Carmichael MP said: ""The Conservatives are too busy dealing with sleaze and scandal to properly tackle crime festering in our communities. They are letting down people across the country with their failure to recruit police officers and tackle crime. “Victims right across the country will be left without confidence in this Government and it's all because of these broken promises and failures."" But the Home Office maintains it is ""well on the way"" to meeting the target. Home Secretary Suella Braverman said: “Improving confidence in our police forces means we must attract the brightest and the best to one of the toughest but most rewarding jobs in our country. I am delighted we are on track to deliver our bold promise to the British people of putting 20,000 additional officers on the streets. “This next generation of brave police officers will add to efforts to drive down invasive crimes like burglary and neighbourhood offences, return to common sense policing and make our communities feel safer and stronger.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tories-verge-breaking-key-pledge-29046068
Michael Gove appears to brand North 'defence full of holes' in strange Messi analogy,"The Levelling Up Secretary admitted that wealth, influence, high-wage jobs and high quality schools are concentrated in the South East, after a damning report lifted the lid on the north-south divideMichael Gove appeared to liken the North of England to a ""defence full of holes"" as he made a football analogy to outline the UK's economic woes - after a damning report revealed a huge divide.  The Levelling Up Secretary claimed that ""not even Lionel Messi "" could plug the north-south gap as he admitted London is the ""star striker"" during a speech in Manchester.  He conceded that for decades the North has lagged behind the capital, with wealth, influence, high-wage jobs and high quality schools disproportionately concentrated in the south east. Addressing politicians and business leaders at the Convention of the North today, he said: ""We all know that we cannot prosper fully as a state if we rely so much on one region and within that region on one city. ""The UK economy has been like a football team with a star striker but a midfield that consistently struggles to get the ball upfield and a defence full of holes.   ""No forward, not even Lionel Messi, can do it on his own. ""Success depends on strength and depth, that's what the UK has lacked for too long."" It comes after a report by IPPR North found that the North of England receives one of the lowest levels of investment among developed economies. Researchers ruled that if the region was a country, only Greece would see less public and private investment of 38 members in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OEDC). It found that productivity is around £7 lower per hour worked in North than the rest of England, while hourly pay is £1.60 lower. Report author and IPPR North research fellow Marcus Johns said: ""Of all the advanced economies around the world, ours is the most regionally divided and getting worse - the North is at the sharp end of these divides and that's a barrier to prosperity.  ""But what's even more unacceptable is that our country is divided by design. It is the result of decisions. ""The North's strengths are national strengths. Northern prosperity can be national prosperity. It's up to the Government to unlock this potential, by acknowledging that it has to change, and by enabling empowered, well-resourced local government to coordinate and deliver long term local visions for change.""  Mr Gove said that the government is ""committed"" to tackling inequality, which he said had been in place for decades. He defended the much-maligned levelling up system, which last week saw £2.1 billion split between more than 100 projects around the UK - confirming that a third round would be held following the March budget. The government came under fire after analysis revealed many of the country's most deprived areas missed out on funding. Councils complained they spent thousands of pounds putting bids together, only for them to be turned down.  The cabinet member vowed to give more power to local leaders on issues such as improving social housing - with a £30 million pot awarded to Greater Manchester and the West Midlands. ""I know the allocation of levelling up funding attracted plentiful comment across the country,"" he said. ""The more people are talking about levelling up, the happier I am."" He defended the ""competitive process"", but admitted that officials will be looking at ways to improve the bidding process next time around."" He said that the north had benefitted most of all from efforts to redistribute power across the UK - with the Treasury boasting a new campus in Darlington, with his department having a second HQ in Wolverhampton. ""So far 20,000 posts have been relocated out of London to the north,"" he said. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/michael-gove-appears-brand-north-29047972
Rishi Sunak told probation service 'on its knees' in wake of Zara Aleena murder,"The Labour leader slammed 'systemic failures' after a report found probation staff missed a 'catalogue of chances' to stop a man with a history of violence murdering the 35-year-old law graduateKeir Starmer has told Rishi Sunak the probation service is ""on its knees"" in the wake of Zara Aleena’s murder. The Labour leader slammed ""systemic failures"" after a report found probation staff missed a “catalogue of chances” to stop a man with a history of violence murdering the 35-year-old law graduate.  Mr Starmer was expected to lead his address in Prime Minister’s Questions with questions about Tory Chairman Nadhim Zahawi who is embroiled in a row over his tax affairs.  But he instead focused his opening remarks on a tribute to Ms Aleena. Mr Starmer described failings in the probation service as a result of ""a botched-then-reversed privatisation, after a decade of underinvestment"" by the Government. He added: ""It's yet another vital public service on its knees after 13 years of Tory government.""   Mr Starmer told the Prime Minister: ""I spoke to Zara's family this morning. It is hard to convey to this House the agony that they have been through. They say that the Government has blood on their hands over these failings. ""He's accepted the findings of the report, does he also accept what Zara's family say?"" Mr Sunak replied that his ""heart of course goes out to Zara's family"", adding that the Government had made moves to address staff shortages and other issues in the probation service. The Prime Minister said £155million was being invested into the probation service each year “so that we can deliver better supervision of offenders”. He added: ""If we do want to increase the safety of women and girls out on our streets then we need tough sentencing, and that is why this Government passed the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act, which he opposite and his party opposed."" But Mr Starmer blasted the Prime Minister for “boasting” about the “protection that he’s been putting in place for women”. He added: “I’m not going to take lectures from him about that.”  Jordan McSweeney, 29, was wrongly considered medium risk by the private firm monitoring him despite the killer warning staff his anger scared him. He attacked Ms Aleena in June 2022, nine days after his release on licence from prison. The Labour Leader later went on to blast Mr Sunak over Mr Zahawi, who is to be investigated over a £5million tax penalty he paid to HMRC.  Mr Starmer ridiculed the ""hopelessly weak"" Prime Minister  for failing to sack  the Cabinet Minister.   Mocking the 5ft 7in Prime Minister, the  Labour  leader asked him whether is starting to wonder whether the role in No10 ""is too big for him"".

Tory scandals plaguing Rishi Sunak - from Nadhim Zahawi's taxes to Dominic Raab bullying row,"Rishi Sunak promise to restore 'integrity' to Government after Boris Johnson's time in Downing Street was dominated by allegations of sleaze and scandal. Let's see how that's going...On his first day as Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak vowed to restore ""integrity and accountability"" to Government after Boris Johnson's scandal-hit stint in Downing Street. The Prime Minister sought to reassure a fed-up nation that he would stamp out Tory sleaze and steady the ship after months of chaos. Standing outside No10, he said: ""Trust is earned. And I will earn yours."" But this promise has been left in tatters.  Just three months on, two Tory ministers are under investigation for their conduct and his predecessor Boris Johnson is still dogged by his Partygate hangover. Worse still, Mr Sunak himself has now received his second police fine while in Government - for not wearing a seatbelt in a moving car.   Here's what you need to know. Nadhim Zahawi's tax affairs  The Tory chairman's future is hanging in the balance after Mr Sunak tasked his ethics advisor to look into his tax affairs. Mr Zahawi is facing questions over a dispute about unpaid tax which he resolved by paying a penalty to HMRC. It centres on shares in YouGov, the polling firm he co-founded before he became an MP. The Tory million is believed to have paid an estimated £5million, including a penalty, to HMRC when he was Chancellor - and in charge of UK tax policy - between July and September.  The PM ordered his independent ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus to launch an investigation after saying there were ""questions that need answering"".  In a statement on Monday, Mr Zahawi said: ""I welcome the Prime Minister's referral of this matter to the independent adviser on ministerial standards. ""I look forward to explaining the facts of this issue to Sir Laurie Magnus and his team. ""I am confident I acted properly throughout and look forward to answering any and all specific questions in a formal setting to Sir Laurie."" But he facing calls to quit, including from Tory ex-minister Caroline Nokes who said he should step aside during the inquiry. Dominic Raab bullying complaints An independent probe was launched into the conduct of Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab after he was subject to multiple complaints of bullying. Lawyer Adam Tolley KC was tasked by Rishi Sunak to examine eight allegations during Mr Raab’s stints as Justice Secretary, Foreign Secretary and Brexit Secretary. Mr Sunak initially stood by the under-fire Justice Secretary but eventually bowed to pressure to allow a formal probe.  Mr Raab has previously defended himself against allegations of bullying, saying: ""I've behaved professionally at all times… I look forward to dealing with it fully and transparently rather than dealing with anonymous comments in the media."" The Prime Minister reappointed Mr Raab as Justice Secretary in October. He held the role under Boris Johnson but was sacked by Liz Truss in September. Boris Johnson's Partygate 'lies' Boris Johnson may be out of office but the shamed ex-PM is still being dogged by the Partygate saga that derailed his premiership. He is due to be hauled before MPs within weeks over whether he lied to Parliament over lockdown boozing in Downing Street. When the Mirror broke the story about gatherings in Downing Street at the height of the pandemic, Mr Johnson repeatedly insisted no parties had taken place and no rules had been broken.  The Privileges Committee, which is investigating his denials over gatherings in No10, is due to begin its explosive hearings in March. The Mirror understands it will grill witnesses on Tuesdays and Wednesdays for several weeks in the run up to Easter. Gavin Williamson bullying claims Bungling Tory Sir Gavin Williamson was forced to quit his Government job in November - only two weeks into Rishi Sunak's premiership - after it emerged he'd sent expletive-filled texts to a colleague. Ex-Chief Whip Wendy Morton complained to Tory bosses about a sweary exchange, where he moaned about not getting a seat at the Queen's funeral in September. He was also reported to the MPs' bullying watchdog - the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) over the messages. Mr Williamson was accused of telling a senior civil servant to ""slit your throat"" in front of colleagues during a meeting when he was Defence Secretary.  On another occasion he allegedly told the official to ""jump out of the window"", according to The Guardian. Former Tory whip Anne Milton also accused Mr Williamson of using MPs’ mental and physical health problems as “leverage” as he attempted to control them. She claimed to Channel 4 that he boasted he “owned” a Tory MP in financial difficulty. In his resignation letter, Sir Gavin said while he refuted the ""characterisation"" of claims against him, he recognised ""these are becoming a distraction"". The South Staffordshire MP vowed to ""clear my name of any wrongdoing"". ...and Rishi Sunak himself The PM landed himself in hot water when he was trying to make a slick Instagram video to promote his levelling up agenda. Sharp-eyed social media users realised he wasn't wearing a seatbelt in the clip, filmed inside his chauffeur-driven car which was clearly moving, flanked by police outriders on motorbikes.  Wearing a seatbelt in a moving car is required by law, and can carry a fine of up to £500. Lancashire Police swiftly ordered him to pay a fixed penalty notice, making him the second PM to be fined by cops in office - after Boris Johnson. Downing Street said the Prime Minister will pay the fine and “fully accepts this was a mistake and has apologised”. Mr Sunak was previously slapped with a Partygate fine for attending Boris Johnson's surprise birthday gathering in the Cabinet room in June 2020.

Russia unveils 'Mad Max' style armoured killing machine dubbed The Wagner Wagon,"Russia's new “Mad Max” style fighting vehicle, dubbed The Wagner Wagon, is mine-resistant and bristling with weaponry such as a 14.5 mm heavy machine gun capable of hitting targets two miles awayRussia's frontline mercenaries have hit back at Western tank threats by shipping in a new armoured killing machine dubbed The Wagner Wagon. The “Mad Max” style fighting vehicle is mine-resistant and bristling with weaponry such as a 14.5mm heavy machine gun capable of hitting targets two miles away. It also boasts two PKT 7.62mm belt-fed machine guns to be used during attacks on frontline infantry troops in relatively high- speed assaults. But while it has been tested in Syria and Libya it is not as deadly as a tank and will be massively outmatched by UK Challenger II tanks being sent to the Ukraine frontline. It comes as German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced Wednesday that the country would provide Ukraine with Leopard 2 battle tanks and approve requests by other countries to do the same.   ""This decision follows our well-known line of supporting Ukraine to the best of our ability,"" Scholz said after a Cabinet meeting in Berlin. Germany was ""acting in close coordination"" with its international allies, he added. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg welcomed the announcement tweeting this morning: ""At a critical moment in Russia’s war, these can help Ukraine to defend itself, win and prevail as an independent nation."" The long-awaited decision came after US officials said Tuesday that a preliminary agreement had been struck for the United States to send M1 Abrams tanks to help Ukraine's troops push back Russian forces that remain entrenched in the country's east almost a year after Russia invaded its neighbour. Germany had faced criticism after weeks of hesitation that delayed supply to Ukraine’s forces of the crucial tanks by countries such as Poland as Berlin owns the export licence. Once Ukraine is armed with Leopard 2 tanks it is believed they could support the 14 Challengers in launching a full-on assault on Russian troops. It is widely feared Moscow is preparing a large-scale operation in the Spring to try and drive Ukrainian forces back, using armoured attack vehicles.  One UK security expert told the Daily Mirror: “Giving Ukraine the superior Leopard 2 tanks will be a game changer in the war as it will outmatch Moscow’s forces. “High-mobility vehicles such as the so-called Wagner Wagons are one thing against jihadists in the deserts of Syria and Libya but will be hopeless against Leopards and Challenger tanks. “They are only effective against infantry.” It is believed Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing to mobilise hundreds of thousands of new recruits into the Ukrainian frontline within months.  Poland has officially requested permission from Germany to transfer its Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine to help fight Russia's invasion, the Polish defence minister has said. German officials confirmed to the DPA news agency that they had received the application and said it would be assessed ""with due urgency.” Foreign minister Annalena Baerbock claims Berlin, which builds the tanks, would not seek to stop Poland from providing the high-tech armour to Kyiv.   Polish defence minister Mariusz Blaszczak also appealed to Germany ""to join the coalition of countries supporting Ukraine with Leopard 2 tanks"" before the nation confirmed it was today. Mr Blaszcraz tweeted: “This is our common cause, because it is about the security of the whole of Europe!"" Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg also called for the speedy delivery of new weapons to Ukraine which is braced for a Russian Spring Offensive. He said: ""At this crucial moment in the war, we need to provide Ukraine with heavier and more advanced systems, and we need to do it faster.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-unveils-mad-max-style-29047160
"Under-fire Nadhim Zahawi telling MPs he 'hasn't done anything wrong', says Tory","Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has ordered his ethics chief Sir Laurie Magnus to launch an investigation into Nadhim Zahawi's tax affairs as he scrambles to quell a fresh Tory sleaze row Tax row Tory Nadhim Zahawi has been telling MPs that he ""hasn't done anything wrong"" as he faces a probe into his financial affairs. Backbencher Bim Afolami revealed that the shameless Tory had been telling MPs that he was in the clear as he sought to defend the under-fire party chairman.

Mr Afolami told TalkTV: ""I spent quite a long time talking to him today and he was making the point, to not just me but to many other colleagues as well, that actually he hasn't done anything wrong. ""It's typical when people sell businesses that themselves and their accountant make a judgement as to what happens, how much tax they owe.

Nadhim Zahawi's tax bill would have covered rises for everyone in Stratford-upon-Avon,"Labour’s number-crunching found amount of Mr Zahawi’s tax that went unpaid until recently would be enough to cover this year’s increase for 86,044 people. Nadhim Zahawi's mammoth tax settlement would have covered the tax rises hitting people in the town where he is MP this year, Labour has claimed.  The Tory chairman is said to have settled a bill worth around £3.7 million with HMRC, after admitting to a “careless” error in his tax arrangements.  Households are paying an average of £103 more in tax this year due to Rishi Sunak ’s decision to freeze income tax and NICs thresholds.  Labour’s number-crunching found amount of Mr Zahawi’s tax that went unpaid until recently would be enough to cover this year’s increase for 86,044 people. That’s more than enough to pay the increase for all 30,000 people living in Stratford-upon-Avon, the town he represents as an MP. And it would cover around 90% of the tax rise of the 97,000 people living across his entire constituency.    A Labour source said: “His constituents don’t get to dispute multi-million pound bills with the tax office – the hypocrisy stinks.” Mr Zahawi is subject to an inquiry by the new independent adviser on ministers' interests, Sir Laurie Magnus, into declarations about his tax affairs.  He resolved a multimillion-pound tax dispute with HMRC by paying a penalty while serving as chancellor under former prime minister Boris Johnson.   Labour said Mr Zahawi's admitted carelessness should see him removed from Government.

North of England receiving among lowest levels of investment of advanced economies,"It comes after Rishi Sunak faced a barrage of criticism over a £2.1billion round of levelling up funding, which saw cash go to a string of wealthy areas while a number of deprived communities missed outThe North of England receives among the lowest levels of investment of the world's advanced economies, a think tank has warned. A damning report by IPPR North found Greece would be the only OECD nation to get less public and private investment than the North if the region was a country. Researchers found that the UK as a whole ranks 35 among the 38 OECD countries in terms of receiving the least investment. States including Slovakia, Poland and Hungary all enjoy more investment than the UK. If the OECD average was applied to the UK for 2017-2020, a whopping £397billion more would have been invested, the report found. It comes after Rishi Sunak faced a barrage of criticism over a £2.1billion round of levelling up funding, which saw cash go to a string of wealthy areas while a number of deprived communities missed out. The UK and the North are being held back by ""vast inequalities"" and ""systematic underinvestment"" in research and development, social infrastructure and transport, IPPR North said.   Productivity is around £7 lower per hour worked in the North than the England average, and hourly pay is £1.60 lower than in the rest of England. IPPR North research fellow Marcus Johns said: ""Of all the advanced economies around the world, ours is the most regionally divided and getting worse - the North is at the sharp end of these divides and that's a barrier to prosperity. ""But what's even more unacceptable is that our country is divided by design. It is the result of decisions. ""The North's strengths are national strengths. Northern prosperity can be national prosperity.  ""It's up to the Government to unlock this potential, by acknowledging that it has to change, and by enabling empowered, well-resourced local government to coordinate and deliver long term local visions for change."" The report points to other floundering places in the world that have turned their economies around, such as Leipzig in Germany, which has become the fastest-growing city in Europe through industry and investment. IPPR North director Zoe Billingham said: ""The international evidence is clear: governments that let go of power and collaborate positively with local places can succeed in levelling up. ""Political leaders need to 'zoom out' and learn lessons from our international neighbours to achieve regional growth and narrow our aching divides. We know that private investment follows public investment.""  Analysis of the levelling up funding shows that seats in the South and London fared better than Yorkshire and the North East, with London receiving £151million compared with just £120million for Yorkshire and £108million for the North East. Projects in the West Midlands received £155million, while the South West was handed £186million. The South East is the second biggest winner with £210million, while the North West was top with £354million. The Centre for Inequality and Levelling Up found that in the two funding rounds so far, a quarter of England's 100 most deprived areas have received no cash at all. A Government spokesperson said: ""This report fundamentally misrepresents the clear steps we are taking to level up the region and we are committed to spreading opportunity across the whole of the UK, including the North of England. ""This includes investing £3.19 billon through our levelling up funds for regeneration, transport and cultural projects and £3 billion to transform local transport networks. The government has also helped secured inward investment, such as Credera in Manchester, Nissan in Sunderland and Equinor in the Port of Tyne, creating thousands of highly skilled jobs. ""We have also launched Freeports in Teeside, Liverpool City and the Humber to drive investment and signed new devolution deals in York and North Yorkshire and the North East, giving more powers to local leaders.""

Is the state pension age rising this year? Everything we know so far ahead of review,"The next review into the state pension age will be published by May 7, 2023 - but what is the current state pension age, and how high could it go? We explain everything you need to knowThe state pension age is gradually increasing and is kept under constant review. The next review will be published by May 7, 2023 - although an exact date hasn’t been announced. This could mean that the state pension age could change again in the future. Your state pension age is the earliest age you can start claiming your state pension. The current state pension age for women and men retiring now is 66, but it will rise to 67 between 2026 and 2028. A further increase to 68 was not due to happen until between 2044 and 2046. However, a review released in 2017 called for this to be brought forward to between 2037 and 2039.   This is seven years earlier than previously planned due to people living longer. An exact timetable for the state pension age rising to 68 by 2039 hasn’t been published yet.  Will the state pension age rise again?  At the moment, we don’t know exactly what the review into the state pension age will reveal. But there is speculation that the increase to 68 may be brought forward beyond what the last review suggested. The Sun this week reported that Chancellor Jeremy Hunt could fast forward the rise to 68 to 2035. Before any future changes could become law, Parliament would need to approve the plans.   How do I check my state pension age?   You can check your state pension age online.   You can also look at your state pension forecast to find out how much money you’ll get.  The state pension is separate to any private or workplace pensions you may have.  How much is the state pension?  There are two different types of state pension - which one you claim depends on when you were born. You claim the new state pension if you’re:  a man born on or after 6 April 1951 a woman born on or after 6 April 1953  The amount you get depends on your National Insurance record. You need 35 qualifying years on your National Insurance record to get the full new State Pension, and ten years to get anything at all. The full new State Pension is worth £185.15 per week. This is rising to £203.85 from April 2023. You can claim the basic state pension if you’re:  a man born before 6 April 1951 a woman born before 6 April 1953  How much you get through the basic state pension also depends on your National Insurance record. You need 30 qualifying years on your National Insurance record to get the full amount. The minimum number of years is usually 11 for men born before 1945, and 10 years for women born before 1950. The full basic state pension is worth £141.85 per week. This is rising to £156.20 from April 2023.   How do I boost my state pension?  There are ways to boost your state pension if you're short on National Insurance contributions - but always seek free advice first. You can put off retiring, which would mean you can build up more years on your National Insurance record. However, keep in mind you will be giving up state pension cash in the short term - so speak to a specialist to work out if this is a good option for you. You could also look into buying voluntary class 3 National Insurance contributions to boost your record. The rate is £15.85 per missing week of National Insurance contributions – £824 for a full year.

Hiking state pension age will bring 'misery' to Brits approaching retirement,"Age UK warned people in their 50s face 'devastating consequences' over reports the Government is considering raising the retirement age to 68 as early as 2035 - but the DWP insists 'no decision' has been made Ministers have been warned hiking the state pension age earlier than planned could have ""devastating consequences"" for people in their 50s. Age UK has claimed the move would set up hundreds of thousands already struggling for a ""miserable and impoverished few years in their run up to retirement"".  It comes amid reports the Government is considering raising the retirement age to 68 as early as 2035.  The change, which could be announced when Chancellor Jeremy Hunt delivers the Budget in March, would affect those born in the 1970s and later.  The current retirement age is 66 and will increase to 67 in 2028, but as it stands, a scheduled rise to 68 is not due until 2046. The Department for Work and Pensions insisted that ""no decision"" had been made by ministers on changes to the state pension age. In a new analysis, Age UK says that 3.5million aged 50-64 are currently classified as 'economically inactive' with 31% having savings of less than £5,000.   The organisation adds there is ""no justification"" for increasing the state pension age, with 1.3 million sick and a half a million with caring responsibilities. Charity Director Caroline Abrahams said: ""Nothing could better demonstrate the level of inequality in our society and the importance of doing more to give those on the lowest incomes in this age group some hope. ""If Ministers decide to tinker with the SPA [state pension age] again as part of their review, and do so in favour of the state, this will definitely be a move in the wrong direction and a denial of social justice."" She added: ""Certainly, as things stand, and against the context of endemic ageism in the labour market, any decision by the Government to make today's fifty-somethings wait longer for their state pension would be setting up hundreds of thousands of men and women for a miserable and impoverished few years in their run up to retirement – a kick in the teeth they could well do without.” The Liberal Democrat's DWP spokesperson Wendy Chamberlain said the Government ""seems to have completely lost the plot"". She added: ""They’ve messed up people’s lives by hiking taxes and causing mortgages to spiral and now they want to force millions to change up their retirement plans.  ""With like expectancy falling there is a real risk that people will die before they reach retirement. It just shows this government is completely out of touch.”  Tom Selby, the head of retirement policy at the investment service AJ Bell, said: "" Rishi Sunak will be playing with political fire if he decides to accelerate the planned increase in the state pension to 68.  ""The latest official data suggests average life expectancy improvements – the main justification for state pension age increases - have gone into reverse since the pandemic."" A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions added: The Government is required by law to regularly review the state pension age and the second state pension age review is currently considering, based on a wide range of evidence including latest life expectancy data and two independent reports, whether the rules around state pension age remain appropriate. “The review will be published early this year.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/hiking-state-pension-age-bring-29039945
Top Tory breaks ranks to tell Nadhim Zahawi to ‘stand aside’ during tax probe,"Tory Caroline Nokes said the row over Nadhim Zahawi's taxes was a 'hangover from Prime Ministers past', in a swipe at Boris Johnson whose time in No10 was dogged by allegations of sleazeTax row Tory Nadhim Zahawi should stand aside while a probe into his affairs is ongoing, a senior Conservative has said. Ex-Minister Caroline Nokes broke ranks to call on her party colleague to recuse himself from his role as Tory chairman while Rishi Sunak's sleaze watchdog looks into a multimillion pound tax dispute he resolved by paying a penalty to HMRC Mr Zahawi is alleged to have paid an estimated £5million penalty when he was Chancellor - and in charge of UK tax policy - between July and September. The Prime Minister ordered his new ethics chief, Sir Laurie Magnus, to look into the row in a bid to defuse the latest Tory sleaze scandal. It comes only days after Mr Sunak told MPs that Mr Zahawi had ""already addressed this matter in full"". No10 insisted the PM had not been aware at the time of PMQs that Mr Zahawi had paid a penalty to HMRC. Ms Nokes said the row was a ""hangover from Prime Ministers past"", in a swipe at Boris Johnson whose time in No10 was dogged by allegations of sleaze. Read More
   The Women and Equalities Committee chair told BBC Breakfast: ""Sadly this looks like a hangover from Prime Ministers past and I think Nadhim needs to come clean on all of the questions that are being posed by journalists and others, and that we need clarity. ""I think it's a really difficult situation for any Government minister when you are pretty much leading the news on every front page this morning."" Asked if he should stand down, she said: ""Nadhim should stand aside whilst this investigation is carrying on.  ""There are great precedents of ministers who have been competent, hardworking - and Nadhim is a certainly a very talented politician but maybe he should temporarily recuse himself until this investigation is over.""  Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy said Nadhim Zahawi ""ought to resign or be sacked"" over the tax dispute.  He warned that it was not acceptable to be ""careless"" with money that pays for teachers and nurses. ""When you've been Chancellor of the Exchequer and you said you've been careless despite the fact that offshore trusts have been set up in Gibraltar, I'm sorry you really ought to resign or be sacked,"" he told Sky News. Policing Minister Chris Philp floundered on the airwaves after facing a barrage of questions over Mr Zahawi's tax affairs. He said it was for the Prime Minister's ethics adviser to find out ""the facts"" behind Mr Zahawi's ""carelessness"" in reporting his financial affairs to HMRC.  Gov.UK states that ""carelessness"" with tax affairs can be likened to the ""longstanding concept in the general law of negligence"", he was told by Today presenter Mishal Husain. Asked whether the PM found it acceptable for minister to be ""negligent in their tax affairs"", Mr Philp said: ""We've got this word 'careless' that has been put into the public domain. ""We don't know exactly what it was that that carelessness represents."" Pressed again, he said: ""You're effectively inviting me to speculate on exactly what happened. ""I don't know exactly what happened, I don't know what form that carelessness took and nor probably does anybody else apart from HMRC and Mr Zahawi. So let's find out the facts."" In a statement on Monday, Mr Zahawi said: ""I welcome the Prime Minister's referral of this matter to the independent adviser on ministerial standards.  ""I look forward to explaining the facts of this issue to Sir Laurie Magnus and his team. ""I am confident I acted properly throughout and look forward to answering any and all specific questions in a formal setting to Sir Laurie."" He said it would be ""inappropriate to discuss this issue any further"" while he was Conservative chairman. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/top-tory-breaks-ranks-tell-29033815
"Experienced nurses leaving NHS in 'droves' as staff 'run ragged', health leader warns","The President of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine Dr Adrian Boyle told MPs he is worried 'burn out will lead to burn away' with existing health service staff overwhelmed A health leader has warned experienced nurses are leaving the NHS in ""droves"" with staff being ""run ragged"".  The President of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine Adrian Boyle told MPs on Tuesday he was worried ""burn out will lead to burn away"" with existing staff overwhelmed. Pressed at the Health and Social Care Committee on whether he is concerned about staff retention, he warned: ""I'm worried burn out will lead to burn away"". He warned MPs: ""What I'm also seeing is a lot of nurses, particularly the experienced nurses... who know how to get things done are leaving in droves. ""Everytime I go into work I'm seeing nurses [say] 'could you sign this leaving card'. ""We are haemorrhaging experienced emergency nurses because they find it very frustrating"". Dr Boyle said some nurses feel ""overwhelmed"" and that ""their registration is at risk because it feels so dangerous, they are finding it extremely difficult"". Read More
  ""I think staff morale is a huge concern for us at the moment"".  In September 2022 data examined by the Nuffield Trust showed a record number of nurses quitting the NHS in England with more than 40,000 leaving in one year - one in nine of the workforce.  It comes after Dr Boyle warned earlier this month that between 300-500 people were dying each week because of delays and problems in emergency care.  He told MPs that staff are being ""run ragged"", adding: ""What we are seeing now is that in most emergency departments the staff - which are probably the same number staff as last year - are also running a medical ward in addition to be responsible for all the new arrivals. ""The dilution and delay of care in the emergency department is such a risk we feel this is justified."" Asked about a visit to No10 to discuss pressures facing the NHS, he went on: ""We welcome this problem is being taken seriously because our situation is so dangerous and so serious at the moment we are very glad people are taking this seriously"".  He said surge capacity funds given to hospitals were welcome but warned there were ""serious structural problems that impair our ability to do urgent and emergency care"".  ""We have the second lowest number of beds in the OECD comparators, we run our hospitals far too full with very, very high occupancy levels ""It's a step in the right direction but this is going to take a long time to recover.

Should NHS patients be charged for GP appointments and A&E visits?,"The former health chief said the NHS could not survive much longer without radical change and the UK should extend ""the contributory principle"" to tackle waiting times - what do you think?Sajid Javid has said patients should be charged for GP appointments and A&E visits to reduce demand - and we want to know what you think.  The former Health Secretary claims the NHS could not “survive much longer” without radical change, adding the health body had become unsustainable.  Under his proposed plans, Brits would be charged £20 fees for GP appointments, and £66 for emergency visits without a referral. Writing in an op-ed for The Times, Mr Javid suggested that the UK should extend “the contributory principle” to tackle waiting times. He said that means-tested fees should be introduced, while “protecting those on low incomes”. “We should look, on a cross-party basis, at extending the contributory principle,” he wrote. “This conversation will not be easy, but it can help the NHS ration its finite supply more effectively.” Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the Guardian that payment for services could end up with people missing early diagnosis and undermine the entire basis of the NHS.

'North East has most disabled people but is ignored into extinction by Tories',"South Shields lost out in its bid for the second round of the Tory government's Levelling Up funding, but the North East was also revealed to have the highest proportion of disabled people in the countryLast week my town made the news for frustrating reasons. As Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced the second round of Levelling Up funding, here in South Shields we found out our bid had been rejected, again. MP for South Tyneside Emma Lewell-Buck summed it up best on Twitter: “Freeports bid – rejected; towns fund bid – rejected; two levelling up bids – rejected. Levelling up is just an empty slogan."" The allocation of funds has prompted accusations that wealthier parts were awarded over the most deprived areas and that conservative voting constituencies benefitted the most. This certainly seems to be the case for us, South Tyneside has the third worst employment rate, 13th lowest income and the sixth worst rate of absolute child poverty in England. It’s also the 26th most deprived area in England. So why is it that the PMs own constituency of Richmond in North Yorkshire - the 251st most deprived area out of 317 in the country- was awarded £19 million while South Shields’ bid of £20 million, which would’ve massively transformed our dilapidated town centre rejected? Overall the North East received the lowest amount of Levelling Up Funding, facing severe criticism from Labour as Shadow Levelling Up Secretary Lisa Nandy said: “It takes an extraordinary arrogance to expect us to be grateful for a partial refund on the money they have stripped out of our communities, which has decimated vital local services like childcare, buses and social care. “It is time to end this Hunger Games-style contest where communities are pitted against one another and Whitehall ministers pick winners and losers.""  The North East was awarded just £108.5m, while the south-east will get nearly double that at £210.5m and London alone will receive £151.3m. Retired psychiatric nurse Ian Taylor, 66, told The Mirror that South Shields was “the forgotten town in one of the forgotten regions of the country” and I have to agree. I know what you’re thinking, this is a disability rights column, what does this have to do with disability rights? Well the news came on the day that ONS 2021 census data on disability was released and guess which region has the most disabled people? Bingo - the North East. In England as a whole 17.7 per cent of people, or 9.8 million, said they had a disability. In the North East 567,000 people were disabled. That may not seem like a lot and certainly more regions have higher number of disabled people, but that’s 21.2% per cent of the population of the whole of the North East.  When asked if their household had two or more disabled people in, 7.8 per cent of households (92,000) in the North East said yes, compared with 5.1 per cent in the London. If you zoom into South Tyneside, which the tories very much aren’t, 42023 people are disabled (22.1 per cent) and 7.9 per cent of households had two or more disabled people living there. This is whilst our hospital is constantly under threat and government funding for care and improvements is at an all time low. I moved here just over five years ago from Sunderland and honestly, I love it here. There’s a huge community spirit, and an absolutely stunning coastline - which is just a short walk from my house- and our a gorgeous seafront which has benefitted from government funding. However, walking five minutes into the town centre tells an entirely different story.  There are more empty shops than open ones. Of those that are open, the majority are charity shops and bookies, with local businesses struggling to keep up with rents. If the pull of the seaside wasn’t enough the people here are some of my favourites ever. Shields folk are resilient, tough and more than anything kind. The community I’ve built here is always willing to help their neighbours and remind each other that we’ve just got to get on with it. Though I guess that’s the spirit you have to have when conservative governments ensured your town’s livelihoods - coal mining and shipyards - were obliterated and you weren’t given any support to recover from that.  Perhaps it’s no coincidence that a place with one of the highest disability figures, child poverty and lowest employment and income is also a solid labour constituency. We’ve never recovered from what the Tories did to us in the 80s and now they’re hoping to ignore us into submission, or extinction. The North East has been ignored for too long, we shouldn’t have to be resilient we should be supported by a government that wants all its people to not just survive but thrive - instead of just those who vote tory.",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/my-north-east-town-being-29041917
Deadly failings with one person killed every SIX days by criminal on probation,"Every six days someone is killed by an offender on probation and criminals on licence killed a total of 599 people in the last decade- our criminal justice system is in crisis, so when will the Government address these deadly failings?The Chief Inspector of Probation says he cannot guarantee the public is being properly protected. Justin Russell was speaking after his report slammed failings that left a sex predator free to kill Zara Aleena. He said the “clear lesson” is that staff are overworked. A murder is committed once every six days by a convicted criminal under probation supervision, figures reveal. Criminals on licence killed a total of 599 people in the last decade, and an average of 60 every year, Ministry of Justice statistics show. The grim toll can be revealed after ministers and probation leaders were said to have “blood on their hands” for failings that left sexual predator Jordan McSweeney free to kill Zara Aleena.   Not all the murders recorded can be blamed on probation failings but Chief Inspector of Probation, Justin Russell, has now warned that without urgent Government action to reverse cuts, he cannot guarantee that the public is being properly protected. A damning report published yesterday found McSweeney, 29, was wrongly considered medium risk by the private firm monitoring him, despite him warning his own anger scared him.  McSweeney got a life sentence and will serve at least 38 years after admitting sexually assaulting and murdering Zara in Ilford, East London. He had been free for only nine days last year when he stalked the aspiring lawyer, 35, grabbed her and repeatedly kicked and stamped on her head and body resulting in 46 injuries. During that time, he had failed to turn up for three probation appointments and disappeared from his mum’s house after drinking heavily.  Prison staff submitted 15 concerns about McSweeney, mainly for making weapons and using drugs, but details were not shared with probation. Justice Minister Damian Hinds has said he was “profoundly sorry” for the “serious failings”. None of those involved in the management of McSweeney will face any disciplinary action. Zara’s aunt Farah Naz said “heads should roll”. She said: “Zara’s life was taken and probation have blood on their hands.”  Mr Russell said yesterday there are over 500 serious further offences, including murder and rape, committed on probation each year. He said: “Until the Probation Service puts those things right, it’s impossible to say that the public is being properly protected from the risks that people on probation pose.” The “clear lesson” from Aleena’s case is that “overworked staff” do not have time to go over case files, he said.  He revealed he offered to speak to Justice Secretary Dominic Raab to discuss his concerns, adding: “I’m hoping he’ll take me up on that opportunity.” McSweeney was only classed as medium risk by a Community Rehabilitation Company. CRCs were introduced by ex-Justice Secretary Chris Grayling in 2014 but axed in 2021. They cost almost £500million and led to a rise in killings by people on probation.  Centre for Women’s Justice director Harriet Wistrich said of Zara’s case: “This is only one of a series of murders that might have been avoided over the last few years.” Labour’s Jess Phillips said: “The truth is we do not monitor these people and we should stop pretending otherwise. There is no monitoring of the most violent, well-known, prolific offenders against women and girls.” A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""Serious further offences are incredibly rare and the Deputy Prime Minister has set out plans to overhaul the parole process and invest £155m more into probation to keep the public safe.""

Inside seaside town where life expectancy is LOWER than planned new State pension age,"In Blackpool’s Bloomfield ward, in the shadow of the town’s football ground, the average life expectancy of men is just 67 years and three months - lower than the new proposed state pension age of 68Government plans to increase the state pension age to 68 have been blasted as “bonkers” in a town where average life expectancy is a low as 67. For decades the seaside resort of Blackpool has been a much-loved destination for millions of holidaymakers. But away from the bright lights of the illuminations and the thrills and spills of the Pleasure Beach rides, there are large pockets of poverty. In 2019 the resort had eight of the 10 most deprived neighbourhoods in England, according to government figures. And in Blackpool’s Bloomfield ward, in the shadow of the town’s Bloomfield Road football ground, the average life expectancy of men is just 67 years and three months.   Builder Alex Johnston, 24, said the government’s pension plan was “bonkers”. Alex from nearby Lytham St Annes, who was refurbishing a shop close to the stadium, said: “If the life expectancy is younger than the age of retirement, something is going wrong. “Even when people do get their pensions they still have to live modestly most of the time.”  He added: “It is not really possible for us in the construction industry to work to that age.  ""I have been doing this for five or six years and can already feel the toll it is taking on my body because of the amount of heavy lifting we have to do. “With a lot of the hazardous materials we have to deal with, the dust, even with the PPE we wear, it is still a higher risk for respiratory problems, which will probably end up lowering our life expectancy.”  Leanne Hewitt, 38, who runs a nearby electrical goods store, fears the state pension age is heading towards “the mid 70’s”. “I don’t think I’ll ever get my state pension, the way things are going” she said. “We will be literally working into our graves.  “People are trying to get as much work as we can, just to be able to eat, just to be able to live. “And life expectancy is going to go down, if people can’t afford to eat or keep themselves warm.” Her assistant Cat Barry, 39, said: “We are looking at getting our pensions in another 30 years, but by then the state pension age will have gone up again.   ""And people will not be able to physically do it.” She added: “People have worked all their lives, and for what, to be told you have to work longer? “Even when they do retire, the money is not enough to live on because the cost of living has gone up so much. “I had a private pension but I had to stop it because I could not afford to keep paying into it.”  John O’Connor, 34, runs a hotel in the Bloomfield ward with his partner Louise Brown, 35. He said: “My dad is 62 and he has another five years to go before he gets his pension and he has worked all his life, and now they want to increase it again? It is wrong. “It is a joke, especially when you look at the life expectancy around here.  “The retirement age should be getting lower, not higher.” Louise said: “We are going to end up working until we die.  ""People are not going to be able to enjoy their retirement.   “People who work hard and would be looking forward to retirement now face working longer.” She added: “Saving is the best thing you can do if you want to take early retirement but not everybody is in a position to do that, especially now.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/inside-seaside-town-life-expectancy-29042367
"Tory lawbreaking makes Britain look 'unreliable' to global allies, warns David Lammy","The Shadow Foreign Secretary said that police fines for both Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunk while in No10 - and Tory legislation that aimed to flout international law 'damages our moral authority and political credibility'Tory lawbreaking is harming Britain's reputation on the world stage, David Lammy has said. The Shadow Foreign Secretary said that police fines for both Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak while in No10 - and Tory legislation that aimed to flout international law “damages our moral authority and political credibility”. This dire record has shown the UK to be “unreliable” and hindered efforts to make international pacts, he told Chatham House.  He vowed to shore up Britain’s “tarnished reputation” with international allies and build closer ties with Europe after the Brexit battles. In a speech to the foreign policy thinktank, Mr Lammy said: “Britain’s record of respect for the rule of law has become tarnished through the Overseas Operations Bill, the Internal Markets Bill, the Protocol Bill and two prime ministers fined for breaking the law.   “This record damages our moral authority and political credibility. It shows us as unreliable, making future agreements harder to reach. “It serves the interests of those who want to weaken the rule of law. It is unbefitting of this great country.” Mr Lammy echoed the famous Vote Leave slogan, saying Britain needs to “take back control” of its foreign policy, in a sign of Labour’s growing confidence on Brexit after years of division. He also channelled Jeremy Corbyn by saying foreign policy needs to be “for the many not the few”. Labour would make closer cooperation with Europe a key priority in Government, he said. Mr Lammy said: “It is time to put an end to what the Economist has called the ‘magical thinking’ of the Conservative Party. “And that means, yes, recognising the damage the government’s bad Brexit deal has done to our economy.” He said Labour won’t reopen fractious debates about rejoining the EU’s customs union and single market - which the UK left after Brexit.   “But within our red lines, there is real progress we can make to increase trade with our neighbours and deliver prosperity at home,” he said. “We will aim to fix the Tories bad Brexit deal to increase trade with Europe.” Challenged over Labour's Brexit stance during a Q&A session, Mr Lammy said the UK cannot continue to do the ""hokey cokey"" on this and the bitter Brexit arguments shouldn't be revisited. He wouldn't be pinned down on whether Labour would restore the commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income on aid for the world's poorest.   The Tories broke their 2019 manifesto commitment to keep foreign aid spending locked in at this level - and merged the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development to the fury of diplomats. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the UK's spend would stay at 0.5% until 2028 in the Autumn Statement. Mr Lammy said it would be irresponsible to set out Labour's spending plans ahead of the next election as the economic climate is ""too turbulent"".

Interest rates hiked to 4% in 15-year high - what it means for your money,"The base rate has today been increased from 3.5% to 4% and remains at its highest level since 2008 - but what exactly does it mean for your money? We explain what you need to know The Bank of England has hiked UK interest rates to 4% - its tenth rise in a row as it battles against inflation and soaring prices.   The base rate was increased from 3.5% and remains at its highest level since 2008. But the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policymakers, who decide the bank rate, appeared to hint that borrowing costs may now be near their peak. In its update today, the MPC said it would only raise rates further ""if there were to be evidence of more persistent [inflationary] pressures"" than already forecast. But it didn't say it would respond ""forcefully"" to these pressures, as the committee had said in previous meetings. Markets expect interest rates to peak at 4.5% towards the end of this year - down from the 5.25% that had been forecast following the Mini-Budget. Banks and lenders change the interest rates on their savings and borrowing products in line with the base rate. This means when the base rate goes up, borrowing money becomes more expensive. This is particularly bad for homeowners with a variable rate mortgage - but in some good news, savings rates have gone up.  The base rate stood at just 0.1% in December 2021. MPC members voted by a majority of 7-2 to increase it by 0.5 percentage points. Two policymakers voted to keep the interest rate at 3.5%. Alongside its latest rate rise, the MPC today said the recession the UK is expected to fall into this year will be shorter than previously thought. It is predicting a recession of five consecutive quarters - starting in the first three months of 2023 - with gross domestic product (GDP) falling by 0.5% this year. This is compared with its November forecast of a 1.5% decline. The softened forecast is down to wholesale energy prices having fallen significantly and inflation beginning to fall from its peak. Inflation was last month confirmed to have dipped again to 10.5% - down from a 41-year high of 11.1% - but is still five times above the 2% target. The Bank of England is raising interest rates to try and lower inflation, which is being pushed up by higher energy, food and fuel prices. By raising interest rates, the theory is that households will spend less and this should mean inflation will drop. What it means for your mortgage  If you have a tracker mortgage, then your monthly repayments will become more expensive as these types of deals move in line with the base rate. If you're on a standard variable rate (SVR) mortgage, then you'll likely see your rates go up too - but it is down to your lender to pass on any rises. You'll usually be on an SVR type mortgage deal after your fix or tracker rate ends.  Around two million homeowners are on a variable deal right now. If you have a fixed-rate mortgage, your rates won't change while you're still in your current deal. However, you will likely see your monthly repayments soar when you come to remortgage due to how much rates have risen. The typical two-year fixed rate mortgage has fallen to 5.45% from a peak of 6.65% in October, according to Moneyfacts.  Five-year fixes have dropped from a high of 6.51% in October to 5.2% now. Paul Broadhead, Head of Mortgage & Housing Policy at the Building Societies Association, said: “Another bank rate rise, the tenth since December 2021, will be unwelcome news for many homeowners. “Although the majority of borrowers are on fixed rates, so will not feel the impact of the rate increases until their fixed rate ends, when they do their new rate is likely to be significantly higher than their current fixed rate.  “For example, it’s likely to cost those at the end of a two-year fixed rate who re-mortgage to a new similar deal around £200 more a month.  “For those on five-year fixed rates, their re-mortgage is likely to increase their payments by around £160 a month.“ If you're a renter, you may find your landlord decides to increase your rent if their mortgage has risen as a result of the rate hike. For a rolling tenancy, your landlord can't normally increase your rent more than once a year without your agreement. For a fixed-term tenancy your landlord can only increase the rent if you agree - if you say no, they can put it up after your fixed term ends.  What it means for your debts   The interest rate on most credit cards is variable and will change from time to time anyway. Credit cards are not historically linked to the base rate - but in recent years, some lenders have started to do this. You should get 30 days’ notice if your interest rate is going up. Check the terms and conditions of your credit card to see what could happen to your rate. Over the last year, interest rates on credit cards have been getting more expensive due to the cost of borrowing going up. This means if you need to take out a new credit card, the deals on offer today will be worse compared to a year ago. The average annual percentage credit card rate is now 30.4%, according to Moneyfacts. Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest, said: ""If a credit card interest rate rises, those with hefty debts could explore signing up for a 0% balance transfer credit card that clears the debt with no interest applied for a set period.  ""Lenders can be cautious about issuing these cards, with the more generous 0% periods on the wane and balance transfer fees also edging up, but they can offer respite for consumers."" Interest rates on most personal loans and car financing are normally fixed - but again, most lenders are now advertising higher rates than before. Ms Haine continued: ""Personal loan rates are also edging up, so locking in a good deal now would be wise.  ""Remember, the best strategy when it comes to debt is to borrow as little as possible over the shortest time possible at the lowest rate possible."" What it means for your savings  The one positive of interest rates going up is that savings rates have slowly been rising. But savings rates are still painfully below the level of inflation - so your money is still being eroded elsewhere. The best easy-access rate right now is 3.03% on up to £85,000 of savings from Kroo, or Yorkshire Building Society pays 3.35% but only on up to £5,000. You might be able to beat these rates depending on who you bank with.  For example, the Barclays Rainy Day Saver offers 5.12%, the Nationwide FlexDirect current account pays 5% and the Santander Edge Saver is 4%. Fixed accounts pay more but the rate you get in interest won't go up if there are future Bank of England base rate rises. The best-paying fixed rate deal is 4.5% from Isbank via Raisin for a five-year fix. Fixed rate deals are also slowly starting to fall - the top-paying account paid over 5% back in October 2022. Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at Interactive Investor, urged savers to act now as some banks have been slow to pass on rate rises. He warned: “It could take months for the increase in interest rates to trickle through to savers – if at all.  “The acceleration in the frequency of rate rises has meant that some savings providers may still be catching up to past base rate rises.“ ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/breaking-interest-rates-hiked-4-29106261
Shell profits soar to £32billion as millions struggling to pay their energy bills,"The latest figures follow MPs hearing that around 12 million households are now spending more than 10% of their income on energy bills - the previous definition of fuel povertyShell profits soared to £32.2billion ($39.9billion) last year - the highest in its 115-year history as millions of Brits struggle to pay their energy bills. The oil and gas behemoth also posted record earnings of £7.9billion ($9.8billion) for the final three months of 2022. It comes as energy bills look are set to rocket again in April, when the Energy Price Guarantee will rise from £2,500 a year for the typical household to £3,000. Energy prices have soared in recent months following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, resulting in astronomical profits for energy companies. The latest figures from Shell far exceed its previous record profits of £25billion ($31billion) in 2008 Shell chief executive Wael Sawan said: ""Our results in Q4 and across the full year demonstrate the strength of Shell's differentiated portfolio, as well as our capacity to deliver vital energy to our customers in a volatile world. ""We believe that Shell is well positioned to be the trusted partner through the energy transition.""   Last month, the Mirror reported that five of the world's biggest oil companies are expected to an ""obscene"" £160billion profit bonanza when they all reveal their latest financial results. The forecast combined profits for BP, Shell, along with US heavyweights Chevron and ExxonMobil, and France’s TotalEnergies would equate to more than £5,000 a second. US heavyweight Chevron has already announced record annual profits of £28.6billion while ExxonMobil reported full-year earnings of £45.2billion. The following weeks is expected to see BP reveal it made around £22.4billon, and French giant TotalEnergies £29billion. Last year saw the Government announce an increased windfall tax on North Sea producers - called the Energy Profits Levy - as millions of UK households struggle to make ends meet. Shell has already said it expects to pay around £1.7billion in such taxes for the final three months of last year. Yet it came after bosses at the London-listed multinational said in October it had not paid any UK windfall taxes due to heavy investment in the North Sea.  The latest figures follow MPs hearing that around 12 million households are now spending more than 10% of their income on energy bills - the previous definition of fuel poverty. Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of Energy UK, which represents suppliers, told the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee that customer calls to suppliers were up about 300% on previous years and requests for additional support were also up 300%.  Ms Pinchbeck said: ""That indicates we've got many more houses moving into what has been considered vulnerability previously at pace, and or households who are not indicating to us that they're vulnerable.  ""I think from the suppliers there's an acceptance that more needs to be done in the vulnerability space, and we're working actively with the consumer groups and government to do that, but I would say that this is a much bigger problem than just prepayment meters or vulnerable customers.""   She added: ""Bills are still double what they were 18 months ago and we've got about 12 million households, which is about 40% of customers, spending more than 10% on energy. That's the previous definition of fuel poverty.  ""We need to look at targeted support but we also need to look at this as an affordability crisis across the piece and how that intersects with the wider cost of living.  ""We're up for having those conversations but I don't think that it is as simple as just looking at the Priority Services Register. I think this is still a really big problem.""  Meanwhile, Citizens Advice has warned that an estimated 3.2 million people across Britain ran out of credit on their prepayment meter last year, the equivalent of one every 10 seconds, because they could not afford to top it up.  The advisory service said it saw more people who were unable to top up their prepayment meter in 2022 than in the whole of the last 10 years combined, breaking the charity's predictions for the number of householders it would help as the cost-of-living crisis took hold.  Last week Ofgem announced it is to review the checks and balances energy firms have around placing customers on pre-payment meters, warning it will take further legal action if it finds they are not taking due care.   In a blog, the watchdog's chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said he was concerned about the ""sharp growth in households struggling to pay their bills being switched over to prepayment meters, sometimes without their even knowing about it, leaving them without heating"".  It followed Business Secretary Grant Shapps' demand that energy suppliers stop forcing financially-stretched households to switch to prepayment meters.  Ms Pinchbeck told the committee that among a range of measures to strengthen protection for vulnerable and prepayment customers, Energy UK also wanted to see the Energy Price Guarantee fixed to £2,500 for the rest of the year.  ""There's an underspend on that programme against what was budgeted because gas prices have fallen,"" she said.  ""Were also calling, like the consumer groups, for some kind of targeted support in addition to that, so we're very up for conversations about things like social tariffs.  ""And we've written to the Chancellor to call for the long-term picture on bills to be sorted by investing in green infrastructure but also in energy efficiency and doing some things on VAT to make things easier.  ""We're doing lots behind the scenes and as much as we think that we can given the debt burden on the sector to try and help our customers without saying at all that if rules are being broken then that's excusable.""

Water bills to rise by up to £47 a year from April - how to cut your costs,"Water UK says although companies have ""absorbed as much cost as possible"" this year’s change particularly reflects the inflationary impact of higher energy costsThe average water bill in England and Wales is set to rise by 7.5% or around £31 a year - but some households will see their costs go up by more than this. Water bills, which include the cost of sewage, will go up from £417 a year to £448 on average, Water UK announced today. But some parts of England and Wales will see above inflation rises, while others will see a much smaller increase. This is because prices depend on where you live. The biggest rise in cash terms will hit customers of Anglian Water whose water and sewage bill will rise by £47 from £445 to £492 a year - up 10.5%. Hafren Dyfrdwy customers will see the biggest percentage increase for a combined bill, rising by more than 12% from £331 to £372 - a difference of £41   Water UK says although companies have ""absorbed as much cost as possible"" this year’s change particularly reflects the inflationary impact of higher energy costs. This is because water companies use around 2% of the UK's electricity. These figures are just an average as there are regional variations and other individual factors such as whether a customer is metered and how much water they use which can affect their bill.  Stuart Colville, director of policy at Water UK said: “With an average increase of around 60p a week, most customers will again see a below-inflation increase in their water bill. “However, we know that any increase is unwelcome, particularly at the moment.That is why companies are also releasing an extra £200 million to help those that may be struggling. “Anyone with worries should contact their water company or go to supportontap.org for advice, and it’s worth remembering that water companies will never cut anyone off, or make them use a prepayment meter.” In Scotland, water and sewerage prices depend on your council tax band and are covered by a ""combined service charge"".

The Consumer Council for Water (CCW) says although water companies are helping more than a million households through their own social tariff schemes, it is a ""postcode lottery"". This means many customers who cannot afford their bills slip through the net and more needs to be done.  There are some ways struggling households can reduce their bills or access support.  The CCW’s top three ways to save or seek support with water bills:  See if you'd benefit from a water meter If you have more or the same number of bedrooms in your house than people, then it is worth seeing if you would benefit from a water meter. Not everyone will save with a meter but water companies will give you two years to trial one and switch back if you’re unhappy.   The CCW has a water meter calculator on its website that can help you work out if you might save. Reduce hot water usage  Much of the water we use in the home comes from the hot tap, which means if you have a water meter you can double up on water and energy savings too. If every person in a family of four halved their daily shower time from 10 minutes to 5 minutes they could save more than £700 a year, which is the water and energy bill savings combined.  Sign up for a water social tariff  You cannot change your water company, like with gas and electricity, but you may be able to switch your tariff. All water companies offer reduced tariffs to low-income customers and the eligibility and the level of support varies from company to company. To access this help, you will need to contact your water company directly.  Use water saving devices Many water companies offer free water-saving devices that shave pounds off your bills and these freebies usually consist of shower timers, buffalo bags, and Leaky Loo detection strips.   If you are able to, you can also install a water-efficient showerhead, the cheapest can cost between £10 to £15.  The average shower uses between 10 and 15 litres of water per minute, but a water-efficient showerhead only uses eight litres which is a lot less and could in turn reduce your water bill.

Big Four banks made £20billion in nine months as households battled interest rates,"Unite said in the first nine months of last year, Barclays made profits of £4.6bn, HSBC Holdings more than £8.9bn, Lloyds Banking Group over £3.9bn, and NatWest Group £2.2bnThe Big Four banks raked in nearly £20billion profit in the first nine months of last year as households were left reeling from a surge in interest rates. Union Unite has called for a windfall tax after accusing Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and NatWest of “profiteering”. Lenders have made a packet on the back of a series of Bank of England rate hikes to try to curb inflation. The Bank is expected to up rates again today, to 4%, the highest since the 2008 financial crisis.  In December 2021, its base rate stood at just 0.1%. The rise has boosted the amount banks make from loans. Unite said, in the first nine months of last year, Barclays made profits of £4.6bn, HSBC Holdings more than £8.9bn, Lloyds Banking Group over £3.9bn, and NatWest Group £2.2bn.   Its general secretary Sharon Graham said: “Interest rate rises are putting the fear of death into households across Britain, but we know now that at the same time they are delivering billions in excess profits to the big City banks. “Our economy is broken. Nothing symbolises that better than politicians demanding pay cuts from nurses whilst doing nothing to get City noses out of the trough.” “That’s why I am calling for a windfall tax on the excess profits of the big banks. Workers did not create this crisis and they should not be the ones to pay for it.  “It’s time the profiteers and their friends in the City were told profiteering won’t pay.” Last November, former Bank of England Deputy Governor Charlie Bean backed the idea of a raid on banks’ windfall profits to fill a hole in the public finances.

Shop prices 'are yet to peak and will remain high' as inflation hits new heights,"Brits have been warned that they should be prepared that peak inflation for food prices is yet to arrive and they will ""will likely remain high"" as a result of rising energy bills and labour shortagesShop prices have hit new heights as the cost of living crisis continues - but experts have warned that the peak hasn't yet been reached. Prices are now 8% higher than they were last January, up from 7.3% in December and above the three-month average of 7.5%, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC)-NielsenIQ Shop Price Index. Overall food inflation has risen from 13.8% from 13.3% in December, which is the highest inflation rate in the category on record. Fresh food inflation has also reached a record high. This is due to the increased food production costs, as well as elevated fruit and vegetable prices, which have accelerated to 15.7% from 15% in December. Shelf-stable foods, also known as ambient foods, saw the fastest inflation increase on record as wholesale and bulk prices rose.   This is particularly true for sugar and alcohol, with prices accelerating to 11.3% from 11% in December. On the contrary, clothing and footwear prices eased, which allowed consumers to take advantage of the January sales. Brits have been warned that high prices ""will likely remain high in the near term as a result"" of rising energy bills and labour shortages. Speaking about the rising prices of food, BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: ""Retail prices rose in January as discounting slowed and retailers continued to face high input costs. ""With global food costs coming down from their 2022 high and the cost of oil falling, we expect to see some inflationary pressures easing. ""However, as retailers still face ongoing headwinds from rising energy bills and labour shortages, prices are yet to peak and will likely remain high in the near term as a result.""   And Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at NielsenIQ, said that the increase in food inflation may put further pressures on households. He explained: ""Consumer demand is likely to be weak in the first quarter due to the impact of energy price increases and, for many, Christmas spending bills starting to arrive. ""So the increase in food inflation is going to put further pressure on household budgets and it's unlikely that there will be any improvement in the consumer mind-set around personal finances in the near term. ""With shoppers having less money to spend on discretionary retail having paid for their essential groceries, there will be little to stimulate demand across the non-food channels.""

Your rights if you need to take time off work for childcare due to teacher strikes,"Many parents only found out this morning if their children would have to stay at home, leaving some people having to arrange last-minute childcare - so what are your rights if you can't work?Thousands of schools have closed for the day as teachers in England and Wales walk out over pay. The industrial action by the National Education Union (NEU) is taking place today with more strike dates planned throughout February and March. The NEU says more than 150,000 members will strike and it expects 85% of schools will be either fully or partially closed today. Many parents only found out this morning if their children would have to stay at home, leaving some people having to arrange last-minute childcare. But what happens if you can’t go to work because you need to look after your child? We explain your rights.    Can I take the day off to look after my child?  If your child's school is shut and you're unable to make alternative childcare arrangements, you should speak to your boss as soon as possible. You are entitled to take time off to look after your child in an emergency - this is known as ""dependent leave"" - but your employer does not have to pay you. Check the terms and conditions of your contract to see what your rights to pay are. You should keep in mind that some businesses might question whether the strikes are an emergency as the dates for the industrial action were known in advance. If you had childcare plans in place and they've fallen through at the last minute, make sure you tell your employer - this will likely push your situation into an ""emergency"" category. You should also make it clear if you only found out this morning that your child's school would be shut.   Chris Garner, managing director of HR and employment law firm Avensure, told Mirror Money that another option if you don't want to take the day off unpaid is to use annual leave. He said: “It’s important that people engage with their employer and follow the correct procedures if they’re struggling to secure childcare - failing to do that could result in disciplinary action as well as loss of pay. “School closures will increase the likelihood of absence from work - but we do need to bear in mind that the current situation is not the fault of working parents, nor is it the fault of employers. “Whilst there is no automatic right to time off under these circumstances, a staffing disaster can be avoided with effective communication.“ Mr Garner said employers should try to be ""as reasonable as possible"" while staff should try to give as much notice as they can. If someone has no annual leave left to take, authorised unpaid leave is also an option - or you could ask to work from home if you're able to do your job remotely. Chris added: “If an employee exercises their right to time off work due to dependents and was then subject to disciplinary action, put at risk of redundancy, barred from promotion or similar detriment, the company could find itself facing legal action.“   Teacher strike dates    February 1 (England, Wales and Clackmannanshire, Aberdeen)   February 2 (Dundee, Argyll and Bute) February 3 (South Lanarkshire, Western Isles) February 6 (Inverclyde, Shetland)  February 14 ( Wales)   February 21 (Northern Ireland) February 28 (Scotland and North and North West of England, Yorkshire and The Humber) March 1 (Scotland and East of England, the East and West Midlands) March 2 (Greater London, the South East and West of England) March 15 and March 16 (England and Wales)  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/your-rights-you-take-time-29104062
"Pub giant behind Slug and Lettuce 'to sell 1,000 pubs' in fresh blow for Brit boozers","Stonegate - which is behind brands such as Slug and Lettuce and Be At One - is planning to put 1,000 pubs on the market due to a £2.6 billion debt pile while admitting their 'biggest concern' right now is the cost of energyA major chain has revealed that it ‘plans to sell off a 1,000 of its pubs’ following news that some Wetherspoons boozers have shut for good. In a huge blow to punters, Stonegate - which is behind brands such as Slug and Lettuce and Be At One - is now looking to put some of its pubs on the market. According to Bloomberg, the pub giant is now looking to scale back, after acquiring a whopping £2.6 billion debt pile. They have admitted that their ""biggest concern"" right now is the cost of energy as they have been left unsure how they will pay the bill from April and onwards. Just before the pandemic, Stonegate became Britain’s biggest pub group after spending nearly £1.3 billion buying rival Ei Group, formerly known as Enterprise Inns plc, which was the largest pub company in the UK and had around 5,000 properties.  Now, in a major turn around the giant, which is owned by private equity firm TDR Capital, it plans to sell 1,000 of its pubs - which is more than a fifth of the total they own - for an estimated £800 million.   This, in turn, will also put thousands of jobs at risk. News of this comes following reports that chains across the UK have struggled to make up ground lost during the pandemic after it was revealed that many Brits are opting to drink at home. Many boozers are also factoring in the cost of living crisis, soaring energy bills, persistent labor shortages and high inflation. Speaking about the plan, Ian Payne, Stonegate’s chairman, said in an interview that: “The biggest concern is energy. “We know what we’re going to pay in February and March, but we still don’t know what we’re going to pay beyond that.”  His concerns follow that of Wetherspoons bosses Tim Martin, who recently announced that it currently has 35 pubs up for sale across England and Scotland - having already sold ten of its sites. Chairman Tim Martin said that a decision was made to sell off the pubs due to rising food and energy costs and lack of staff. Meanwile, pubs across Britain are facing higher beer and food costs from their suppliers, while their customers are being squeezed on all fronts by inflation and the cost of living crisis.   Most recently, pub chain Fuller, Smith & Turner Plc warned that their profits were not as high as before, blaming rail strikes for lower sales before Christmas. And the average price of a pint has risen from £2.30 in 2008 to £3.95 last year, while in London some pubs charge more than £8. Stonegate was contacted by The Mirror but was told that they are ""not making any comment on the story"".  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/pub-giant-behind-slug-lettuce-29106729
"UK house prices fall again - down 3.2% from last year peak, according to Nationwide","Even though this may sound like positive news for buyers, Nationwide says that it is ""too early"" to tell whether the housing market had started to recover after the infamous ""mini budget"" last yearHouse prices in the UK continued to fall in January, sliding for the fifth month in a row, according to Nationwide Building Society.  The building society's latest house price index shows the average cost of a home is 3.2% lower than the peak seen last August.  The average UK house price in January 2023 was around £258,297 which is down 0.6%. This is around £4,000 less compared to the month before when the average property price was around £262,068. Annual house price growth also slowed down at the start of the year to 1.1%, down from 2.8% in December.    Nationwide said this was the lowest growth seen since June 2020, when the housing market reopened after being frozen during the early months of the Covid pandemic. Even though this may sound like positive news for buyers, Nationwide says that it is ""too early"" to tell whether the housing market had started to recover after the infamous ""mini budget"" in September last year.  After this budget, mortgage rates by lenders jumped which priced many people out of buying a home, and caused the demand for mortgages to tumble and the number of home loan approvals continued to drop in December. However, Nationwide noted that there were ""encouraging signs"" that mortgage rates were starting to normalise again.  Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said: ""It will be hard for the market to regain much momentum in the near term as economic headwinds are set to remain strong, with real earnings likely to fall further and the labour market widely projected to weaken as the economy shrinks.""  ""Should recent reductions in mortgage rates continue, this should help improve the affordability position for potential buyers, albeit modestly."" Even with these green shoots, Robert says the ""overall affordability"" of houses in the UK looks set to remain challenging for the foreseeable.  On Thursday the Bank of England (BoE) is expected to raise their base interest rate once which will again with many expecting it to rise by 0.5 percentage points taking it to 4%.  This would be the highest level the UK has seen since the 2008 financial crash and will be the tenth consecutive time it has risen since December 2021.  It would also add even more pressure onto homeowners as mortgages will be affected and borrowers as the cost to borrow money will go up too.

M&S wins high court battle with Aldi over design of Christmas light-up gin,"The ruling could result in Aldi having to hand M&S damages and an account of its profits from selling its own light-up Christmas gin - but the budget supermarket is appealing the resultAldi has lost a court battle against Marks and Spencer after it was accused of copying its light-up Christmas gin. The High Court this week ruled that Aldi had infringed M&S’ design, in a blow for the budget supermarket which had denied all accusations. The ruling could result in Aldi having to hand M&S damages and an account of its profits from selling its version of the festive drink. M&S took Aldi to court in December 2021, just a few weeks after Aldi launched the product.  The posh retailer argued Aldi had copied the design of its flagship Light-Up Festive Gin bottles, which contain gold flakes, which it started selling a year earlier in Autumn 2020. The M&S gin costs £6 more than the Aldi version.  Read More
  M&S said the bottle design of the The Infusionist gin liqueur was ""strikingly similar"" to its light-up drink which it held a registered design for. Both products consist of a bell-shaped bottle that is illuminated from below, with gold flakes in the liquid. According to M&S, its product developer came up with the idea of incorporating lights into the base of the bottle after seeing lights in shops on London’s Kensington High Street. The budget supermarket denied the accusation and argued that design features used by M&S were ""commonplace"" and ""widely known across the sector.""  The case then went to the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court and was heard on December 16 2022. The judge for the case, His Honour Judge Hacon, said: “Going back to the statutory test, it is whether the [registered designs] in suit and the Aldi bottles produce a different overall impression.  ""In my judgement, they do not because of the features they have in common.”  Aldi argued in the case that its Infusionist gin liqueur had the words ""The Infusionist Small Batch"" which showed there was a difference from M&S' registered design where no words appear.  However, the judge said the differences were of “relatively minor detail” and the other design factors, like the snow effect of the gold flakes and the bottle shape, were similar. Aldi said it was ""disappointed"" with the decision that was made and that it would appeal the decision. An Aldi spokesperson said: “Aldi is committed to offering customers the highest quality products, at the lowest possible prices.” An M&S spokesperson said: ""We are pleased with the judgement, which demonstrates the importance of protecting our innovation. ""Like many other UK businesses, large and small, we know the true value and cost of innovation and the enormous time, passion, creativity, energy and attention to detail, that goes into designing, developing and bringing a product to market.  ""Our customers have confidence in our products because they trust our quality and sourcing standards so we will always seek to protect our reputation for quality, innovation and value.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/ms-wins-high-court-battle-29103841
Martin Lewis issues eight-week warning to mobile phone users ahead huge price hikes,"Martin Lewis has said that nine million Brits might be out of a phone contract and overpaying on their current deal if they do not shop around before the price hikes in AprilMartin Lewis has issued an eight-week warning to mobile phone users ahead of huge bill hikes. Many of the major telecoms giants are about to put up prices by 14% from the end of March or beginning of April. Martin explained that up to nine million people might be out of contract and overpaying on their current deal if they do not check to see whether they can get a better price elsewhere. He stressed the importance of shopping around and using comparison websites for the best deals. The financial guru issued his warning during his ITV Martin Lewis Money Show broadcast on Tuesday.   He said: ""Last week I told you broadband and mobile bills are going up 14% in April for most of the big firms. ""What I want you to do first is I want you to check if you're out of contract. Over nine million of you are overpaying."" He added: ""If you're out of contract there are actually some of you - outrageously, and this should not be allowed - who got a contract with a handset and once you paid the handset off, they keep the price at the same level so you're still paying the with-handset price even if you're no longer using it."" The money expert continued to explain what you should do if you change networks but wish to keep the same number. On the show last night, he explained that all the providers are just ""piggybacking"" on their signals, so it is important to do a comparison search before settling with a single network.  He said: ""There are only four networks in the UK - EE, O2, Three and Vodafone. Every other mobile provider is piggybacking on their signal. ""Some comparison sites will let you do a comparison limiting to the signal that you get, so you may be able to save money and stick on your signal.  ""I'm not saying it will be exactly the same service - these are different firms, you might not get WiFi calling, you might have to pay for voicemail, you might not get 5G, you might not be able to tether. ""But the point is, if you're staying where you are solely because you like your signal, why not give one of the piggyback providers, if they're cheaper, a go as well?"" How to cut the price of your mobile phone bill If you’re out of contract, chances are you’re paying too much for your mobile phone. Compare prices elsewhere using a comparison website to see if you can get a better deal. When comparing prices, go back and see how many minutes and data you're using in your current deal so you know what type of package you need. The cheapest phone tariffs are typically SIM-only deals. This is because you're only paying for your minutes, data, texts and any other allowances - not the handset. Don’t want to switch elsewhere? Talk to your current provider, explain the prices you’ve seen elsewhere and try to haggle them down. Do keep in mind that if you’re in contract, you may be charged an exit fee for switching.

If the trial goes well, then Greggs customers across the country may be given the chance to try the new offerings later this year.   The new menu additions, include three different Crispy Chicken Ciabatta Rolls, coming in BBQ, Hot & Spicy and Mayo varieties. Greggs is also trialling three new wraps which include BBQ Chicken and Bacon Wrap, Sweet Chilli Chicken Wrap and a Hot & Spicy Chicken Wrap. All these items are priced at £4 or under.   As well as this, Greggs is upping its game with its wedges as the trial will allow customers to top their potatoes with either BBQ Chicken, Chicken Katsu or Vegan Chilli. But if you don't live up North, not all hope is lost. Two new menu offerings have now been introduced to all Greggs sites in the UK after a successful trial period over the last few months.   These items are for those with a sweet tooth and are the hot Yum Yums and Hot Milk Chocolate Cookies which both cost £2.50. Both of the treats are served with either a salted caramel dip or a delicious milk chocolate dip pot. On the launch, a Greggs spokesperson said: “We are always exploring new opportunities to expand our menu and hot to-go offering, providing even more choice and variety throughout the day and as we extend our later opening hours across shops.""

How much your favourite items could rise by - as cost of roast dinner could go up by £10,"Inflation is increasing at a rate that many in the UK have never seen before, and shoppers can’t help but notice the rising prices of items they hold dearThe cost of a pub dinner could increase by nearly £10 over the next 20 years if inflation rises as predicted, according to new research. The average price for one of the UK's favourite Sunday comfort meals costs around £15.42. However, over the next 20 years, the pub grub staple could be priced at around £22.46 in 2042.  This would be a rise of around £8 for the cherished pub roast dinner, according to research by credit card brand Aqua. Aqua used a combination of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) inflation forecast and the Bank of England target ongoing inflation rate to make its prediction.   Its research also estimated the potential costs of some other beloved UK items over the next two decades. Of course, no one knows for sure how inflation will fluctuate over the next few months and years - these are just guesses. Greggs sausage roll Over the last few years, the Gregg's sausage roll has been a key item in representing the true impact of inflation.  Currently, the cost of one nation's favourite baked goods is £1.20, after the price was increased by the bakery chain last month.  Aqua research found that based on the predicted yearly inflation rates, Brits could expect to pay £1.94 for the pastry by 2042. Supermarket meal deal The supermarket meal deal was another item Aqua looked into as millions chose this option for the lunch every day.  The average cost of a meal deal now is around £3.90. However by 2041, Aqua estimates the price to rise by around £2.15 taking the cost of lunch to a potential, and astonishing, £6.05.   Yorkshire Tea Tea bags are another item that has seen a rise in price over the last year with tea-drinkers paying an average of £5.03 for a box of 160 Yorkshire Tea Bags.  With the predicted rate of inflation, Aqua expect the same product will rise to £5.12 by the end of the year.  In 20 years, however, Yorkshire Tea teabags could increase in price to £7.80, increasing the cost of a cuppa by 2p. Cadbury's Freddo frog Alongside the Greggs sausage roll, Cadbury's Freddo Frog chocolate bar has been another item used to represent the high inflationary pressures of the UK.  At one point, the chocolate bar cost just 10p from its launch in the 1900's up until 2005, however today a Freddo Frog costs 30p, which some already feel is an extortionate price.  From its research, Aqua believes this nostalgic childhood icon is to cost an extra 17p by 2042, taking the price up to 47p.  Bottle of Pimms Pimms, a favourite for British BBQ season and a staple summertime beverage, is another popular product that Aqua's research shows will become a little pricier in the years to come. Currently, a 1-litre bottle of Pimms costs an average of £21.75 and by the end of this year, this price is expected to increase to £22.15.  Looking ahead to 20 years from now, we can expect to be paying almost £12.00 extra by 2042, assuming there are no changes to alcohol duty.

Supermarket shoppers face £788 increase in food bills as grocery inflation hits 16.7%,"New analysis by Kantar shows grocery inflation has hit 16.7% - the highest since their records began in 2008 - as shoppers continue to feel the squeeze of the cost of living crisisFood prices are rising at record rates with supermarket shoppers facing a potential £788 annual increase in the supermarkets. New analysis by Kantar shows grocery inflation has hit 16.7% - the highest since their records began in 2008. The latest data covers the four weeks to January 22 and is a sharp increase on the 14.4% inflation seen in December. In comparison, overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation is now at 10.5%. Take-home grocery sales rose by 5.7% during the four week period and by 7.6% over the quarter, Kantar said. Shoppers snapped up more cheaper supermarket own-brand ranges as they looked to cut costs, with sales of these goods up 9.3%. This is compared to pricier branded alternatives, which were up just 1%.   Sales of no and low alcohol beer were up 3% on last year as Brits committed to Dry January. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: ""Late last year, we saw the rate of grocery price inflation dip slightly, but that small sign of relief for consumers has been short-lived. ""Households will now face an extra £788 on their annual shopping bills if they don't change their behaviour to cut costs.  ""Across the market the move is towards everyday low pricing, with many supermarkets offering price matching and using their loyalty schemes to help shoppers save.  ""As a result of this push, the proportion of spending on promotions has dropped to its lowest level since at least 2008 this month, exaggerating the usual post-Christmas drop off in deals."" Aldi was the fastest-growing grocer for the fourth month in a row, with sales up 26.9% year on year and now holding 9.2% of the market.  Lidl's sales jumped by 24.1% to give it a 7.1% market share. Sainsbury's sales increased by 6.1%, just 0.1 percentage points higher than Asda and Tesco, to give it 15.4% of the market.  Tesco remains the largest British retailer with a 27.5% market share while Asda holds 14.2%. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/supermarket-shoppers-face-788-increase-29092051

To maintain the benefits of the Edge or 123 accounts such as cashback on bills, customers will also need to pay in £500 a month. Santander will pay the £200 incentive directly into your qualifying account within 30 days. First Direct - £175 HSBC sister bank First Direct launched this offer last year and gives all new customers £175 when they switch to its current account.  You must also pay at least £1,000 within three months of opening the account to get the cash and it is only available to those who haven't held an account previously with First Direct.  Customers may however hold an HSBC current account and still qualify for the offer, as long as the current account was opened before January 1, 2019. If you switch, you should receive the funds within 28 days.   TSB - £200 TSB has announced is introducing a £200 switch offer for new customers from this Wednesday, February 1. The money will be given to those who switch to a TSB Spend & Save or Spend & Save Plus current account.

To get the first instalment, customers will need to set up at least two direct debits, use their debit card at least once and log into Internet Banking or the TSB Mobile Banking app by April 21.

Couple living on cruise ship as it makes 'more financial sense' than paying mortgage,"Angelyn and Richard Burk say that living on a cruise ship makes ""financial sense"" to them as it is ""cheaper"" than paying for a mortgage, after they left Seattle for a life at sea in May 2021A couple have revealed they are now living on cruise ship as they've found it ""made more financial sense"" than paying a mortgage. The pair, who are originally from Seattle, have opened up about their current living situation and say they don't plan on returning to living on dry land any time soon. Angelyn Burk and Richard Burk say they packed one suitcase each and left their jobs back in May 2021. Angelyn, a former accountant, told Australia’s 7News that the pair love to travel and says they have always searched ""for a way to continuously travel in our retirement that made financial sense"". After crunching the numbers, the pair then realised that they could continue travelling for the rest of their lives for as little as £35.48 ($43.92 USD) a day.   Thanks to a combination of savings and the anticipated sale of their home, the pair have been able to fund their dream lifestyle. So far, they have travelled on various cruise ships around the world, and even embarked on a 51-day trip from Seattle to Sydney. They have even been to been Italy, Canada and the Bahamas, revealing that Singapore has been one of her favourite locations so far. Angelyn explained that the original plan was for them to stay in different countries and eventually retire to a cruise ship, but they found living on a ship would make more ""financial sense"".  They “don’t plan to permanently live on land in the future"" and have meticulously planned their trips ahead. Angelyn says: “I believe this is achievable for the everyday cruiser, but it does take effort. “It is leisurely travel without the complications of booking hotels, restaurants and transportation, while staying within our budget.”  According to Zillow, the average price for home in Seattle is £741,657.26 ($913,416 USD).  The couple's story has gone viral online, with many people saying that this is ""100% something I would do"" to cut back on costs. One person on Reddit wrote: ""My godfather and his wife did this until they passed. Nearly 20 years living aboard."" And another wrote: ""Ok I have a new goal in life now."" While a third put: ""Plus they probably stack those discounts with loyalty programs, I bet they end up with at least one free cruise a year at that rate!""

Can you eat food beyond 'best before' and 'use by' dates? Rules explained,"One in five adults eating smaller portions and buying out-of-date food because of the cost of living crisis, ONS data reveals, so Brits ned to know the difference between 'use by' and 'best before'The price of food is rocketing, leaving many families wondering how they can cut their costs at the supermarket. One in five adults have eaten smaller portions because of the cost of living crisis, and are buying food beyond its ""use by"" date, data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). In a survey of 4,700 people, the ONS found one in seven (15%) adults were somewhat, or very, worried their food would run out before they had money to buy more. Meanwhile, two-thirds (70%) of those who ran out of food in the previous two weeks, and could not afford to buy more, were also struggling with heating. So can being more aware of the labels on your food help you save money?   ""Use by"" dates are used to show when a product is no longer safe to eat - therefore, you shouldn't consume a product beyond this date on its packagine. The Food Standards Agency explains that people should ""never eat food after the use by date, even if it looks and smells ok, as it could make you very ill"". People should also not cook or freeze the food, as the FSA has warned that ""you cannot smell the bacteria which make you ill"". Meanwhile, ""best before"" dates are about the quality of food - this is all to do with when the quality and texture could start to decline. Many supermarkets have dropped the use of ""best before"" labels as they claim that they create food waste.  This is because consumers may get confused and dispose of the food item, when it may still be fine to eat.  You don't necessarily need to bin a food once its ""best before"" date has passed - instead, use its appearance, smell and taste to decide whether it is ok to eat.  However, keep in mind that the further away the ""best before"" date was, the more the texture and quality is likely to have declined. We should mention one exception to the ""best before"" rule: eggs. You should never eat eggs beyond their ""best before"" date due to the risk of salmonella. Official data shows that food prices rose 16.8% in the year to December, with basic items such as milk, cheese and eggs seeing the largest price increases. And prices for other basic items such sugar, jam, honey and chocolate and soft juices also jumped. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/can-you-eat-food-beyond-29094916
Thousands of benefit claimants may have wrongly been paid money after Government error,"EU citizens who claimed benefits before Brexit but were refused a citizens status may have to pay the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) money back due to an data error by the Home OfficeTens of thousands of European Union citizens may have been incorrectly paid benefit payments following a Home Office data error. The issue has been raised by the Independent Monitoring Authority (IMA), a body set up following Brexit, who has warned over 140,000 people could be affected. The Home Office was said to have wrote to individuals who had been refused EU Settled Status, but it did not immediately update its eVisas database. The IMA said this meant people who had been refused continued to be categorised internally as their applications being ""pending"". The status of their application was left as ""pending"" because it was required by the Brexit withdrawal agreement to protect the rights of people who were refused settled status but immediately appealed.    The Home Office updated the ""refused"" statuses on the eVisa database on January 18. The IMA said thousands of people who did not immediately appeal the refusal continued to receive things such as benefits and access to public funds to that they were not entitled to. Around 141,000 EU citizens who applied for EU Settled status were refused between June 2021 and April 2022, according to PoliticsHome, which first reported on this case. Government departments that could also be impacted by this include the Department for Levelling Up, Housing & Communities and the Department for Health & Social Care. The IMA said it was ""concerned"" about the impact this could have on those affected and has written to the Home Office to ""seek clarity"" on the steps that have already been taken.   The Home Office has confirmed to the IMA that this issue only affects individuals who received a refusal decision between June 27 2021 and April 19 2022.  There has been no confirmation on how many people may have been impacted or how much money is estimated to have been wrongly paid out.  The IMA said anyone who has been granted pre-settled or settled status is unaffected, and they do not need to take any action. The IMA has also written to the Home Office to ""clarify"" what steps have been taken to remedy the issue.  The IMA said: ""We are seeking assurance that the EUSS digital system is fit for purpose, maintained and audited to reflect accurate digital statuses, and accurately available on demand for all eligible citizens. ""We will consider the response of the Home Office to our request for information before deciding on what next steps we may take.” A Government spokesperson initially told PoliticsHome: ""Millions have successfully applied to the EU Settlement Scheme and are using their status to prove their rights. “Where someone has been refused status, it's right that the Government takes action to correct their eVisa to reflect this status, to ensure that they only receive public funds and benefits that they are entitled to.”  On the issue of EU citizens having received benefits, a Government spokesperson told the Daily Mirror: “The online digital status for some EU Settlement Scheme applicants who were refused status has been updated in line with the decision taken on their application, which had already been communicated to the individuals concerned. “We are working across government and with the EU and member states to understand any further implications and to ensure the situation is managed quickly and pragmatically.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/thousands-benefit-claimants-wrongly-been-29093414
Boiler expert reveals four warning signs everyone needs to be aware of,"Boiler expert Myles Robinson, from Compare Boiler Quotes, has explained the warning signs your boiler needs an upgrade, as putting it off could lead to bigger problems long termA boiler expert has revealed the four warning signs you need to look out for with your boiler that could signal when it's time for an upgrade. With many Brits confused about when they think their boiler is on the way out, Myles Robinson, from Compare Boiler Quotes, has compiled a list of signs that will help homeowners. He explained that issues with your boiler could lead to problems in the long term. Mr Robinson has also analysed what kind of boilers you could look at investing in, which would help you lower your energy bills. As boilers use different kinds of fuel to work, whether this is oil, LPG or natural gases, it is important that you carefully research which one is best for your home.   There are even biomass and electric boilers available, which don’t use any of these.  But with the price of gas being staggeringly high at the moment, other fuels could be better for your wallet. Here are some of the signs your boiler could need replacing are: Odd smells Mr Robinson has advised that if you start to notice an eggy or sulphurous smell coming from your boiler, then it could be a gas leak. He added: ""If you suspect any kind of gas leak it’s important to immediately switch off your gas supply at the meter, open all windows to ventilate and evacuate the home before calling an engineer out.""  Noisy system The expert says that if you start hearing humming or banging noises, it could mean there’s a build-up of air in the central heating system of your boiler or a drop in the water pressure. This could be dangerous as if it is left unattended for a long period of time, it could lead to an expensive breakdown. Low performance Just like anything mechanical, the older the boiler is, the slower it operates.  Having an old boiler in your home could result in lower performance, meaning that you will find yourself continually adjusting the pressure or waiting longer for the radiators in your home to heat up. The lower performance, Mr Robinson said this could be a sign that your boiler needs an upgrade. Higher bills ""It’s not just the price of fuel that affects your energy bills,"" Mr Robinson said. As technology has improved and gotten better, its become more energy efficient.  Therefore, it is important to check your boiler's energy ratings to make sure it is compatible with today's ratings. For example, an A rated boiler is up to 20% more efficient than a G rated boiler. Therefore, if you need to replace your boiler, you will have some choices when it comes to the type of fuel they use. Mr Robinson added: ""The UK government has said that from 2025, new build homes won’t be fitted with a gas boiler, this is to help achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050."" This data was analysed and compiled by Compare Boiler Quotes using information from Boiler Guide, British Gas and Which.  ONS Census data was also used in this commentary.

Mum reveals how she feeds her family of four for £1 per person - how you can too,"With the cost of living crisis and rising food prices, Zoe Chamberlain wanted to see how little she could spend in Aldi to feed her family of four, saying she needed to cook something ""her kids loved""A mum has revealed how she can feed her family of four for as little as £1 per person, each day. With the cost of living crisis at the forefront of many families minds, many households are looking at how to get the best possible value out of their weekly shop. And with food prices on the rise, many staple items have shot up in price - including butter and bread. Following this, one mum has shared exactly what she cooks, how much she spends on her food shop and whether she had any leftovers from the week.  Zoe Chamberlain aimed to cook the most cost-effective meals that could be stretched and adapted through the week, report Birmingham Live.  By buying all her ingredients from Aldi, she looked at how she could adapt even the most basic items and turn them into something amazing every day.    The mum also looked at her and her family's eating habits to see how she could save money. She ended up successfully spending just under £30 for the week - which works out just a little over a £1 per person each day.  Most importantly, she cooked dinners fresh everyday - which she says her kids loved. Her meal planner also gave the family a cooked dinner each evening, with leftovers being used for lunches and a few extra items remaining for the following week.  Sunday: Roast chicken dinner Zoe says that for Sunday, she cooked an extra large roast chicken with roast potatoes, carrots, broccoli, peas and gravy. Each member of the family had a thigh or drumstick, and she ended up cutting ""up all the breast meat and split it into two portions."" In oder to make the most out of the whole chicken, Zoe says that ""One went into the fridge and the other into the freezer for the following week.  ""I also simmered the chicken bones to make a stock."" Monday: Cottage pie On Monday, Zoe made cottage pie by slipping the ""minced beef in half and cooked it in two separate pans, turning one into a cottage pie filling with onions, carrots, peas, broccoli and gravy and topping it with cheesy mashed potato."" With the other half, she put it into the pan and added onions, garlic, passata, tomato puree and herbs to make a large Bolognese. The mum say that Monday night the family had the cottage pie for tea, and the Bolognese went into the fridge.  Tuesday: Chicken curry The mum-of-four says that what helped her this night was - despite the fact that she could make her own curry sauce from scratch - having a ""jar in the cupboard makes it simple and easy"" for a midweek meal. To the ready-made sauce, she added onions, mushrooms and cooked chicken, alongside half a tin of tomatoes to make it stretch further. She served this to the family with steamed basmati rice. Wednesday: Spaghetti Bolognese Zoe said that the middle of the week is usually busy for the family, so she opted for something quick and easy. She said: ""Wednesday is a busy night for us with after school activities so it's good to have a dinner that's ready to go. I simply decanted the Bolognese mix into a pan and boiled some spaghetti. ""We grated some cheese to go on the top and enjoyed tea in no time.""  Thursday: Sausage casserole This day, the mum says she opted for a chicken casserole which is ""always a winner with the kids"". Cooking the sausages from frozen in the oven - which took about 20 minutes - Zoe then cut them into bite-sized pieces, and added them to a pan of sauce she made with onions, garlic, red peppers and mushrooms. To this sauce she also added tinned tomatoes, mixed herbs and cannellini beans and just a little chilli powder. Friday: Pasta Carbonara Zoe says that this is ""another nice easy dinner that's really cost-effective."" For Friday's dinner, she cut the bacon ""into small pieces then fried it for five minutes then added it to cooked spaghetti and peas mixed with eggs, grated cheese and herbs."" The mum says that you can also use tagliatelle for this dish, but it's a little more expensive. Saturday: Chilli Con Carne Having defrosted the Bolognese sauce the night before, this made Saturday's dinner very easy for Zoe. She says she put the defrosted bolognese into a pan, ""added plenty of chilli powder and some red kidney beans then steamed some rice and grated some cheese to put on the top.""

"Greggs, Costa, and Pret coffees have 'huge differences in caffeine', says Which?","Cappuccinos and espressos from major high street coffee chains have been compared to show which ones are a lot stronger than othersGreggs, Costa, Pret and other high street coffee chains offer ""huge differences"" in the amount of caffeine in each cup, leaving customers with little idea how much they are consuming, a study has found. A medium cappuccino at Costa contains a ""massive"" 325mg of caffeine - around the amount contained in four cups of tea - and is almost five times the strength of a cappuccino from Starbucks, which contains the least at 66mg, consumer watchdog Which? found. Cappuccinos from Greggs and Pret a Manger also contain significantly less caffeine than Costa, as 197mg and 180mg respectively. By comparison, a 250ml can of Red Bull contains 80mg of caffeine.   A single espresso from Pret a Manger contains 180mg of caffeine - six times as much as one from Starbucks, which had a ""meagre"" 33mg by comparison, according to the watchdog's findings. Meanwhile, Pret a Manger's filter coffee also contained the most caffeine at 271mg - two and a half times as much as the Starbucks version, which contained 102mg. Greggs was a close second to Pret for its caffeine levels, containing 225mg in a cup of filter coffee. Caffè Nero had the second lowest levels of caffeine after Starbucks in both its cappuccinos – containing between 110mg and 115mg – and its espresso, with 45mg. The variations are not only due to the number of caffeine shots used across the chains but also the type of coffee bean, of which there are two main types – Arabica and Robusta.  Arabica beans contain around half the caffeine of Robusta beans, and there are also variations in taste between the two. However, the findings show buying coffee on the high street could be potentially problematic for consumers who are sensitive to caffeine, or are pregnant.  The NHS says pregnant women should consume no more than 200mg of caffeine per day, advising that a mug of instant coffee contains 100mg and a mug of filter coffee contains 140mg.  Which? nutritionist Shefalee Loth said: ""Many of us rely on coffee to get us through the dark winter mornings, but our research shows you may be consuming significantly more, or less, caffeine than you bargained for. ""Our analysis has shown that there are big variations in caffeine content between drinks from different high-street coffee shops. ""Most of the time this shouldn't be an issue but if you drink a lot of coffee or need to limit your caffeine intake you might want to consider what you're ordering and where from.""  A Costa Coffee spokeswoman said: ""The amount of caffeine included within each coffee varies, depending on both the coffee and size of drink ordered by a customer. ""All Costa coffees can be enjoyed with decaf coffee and we offer a wide range of non-caffeinated drinks including the FuzeTea Superfuzions range. ""All caffeine information is available both in our store or via our website and we would encourage customers to be aware of the caffeine content in their favourite Costa coffee to ensure it is right for their dietary requirements or lifestyle choice."" Pret a Manger declined to comment. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/greggs-costa-pret-coffees-huge-29097549
"Tesco announces huge change to all supermarkets with more than 2,000 jobs at risk","Tesco did not confirm the exact amount of deli and counter staff who will be affected by the closures at the end of next monthsTesco has announced a huge series of changes across its supermarkets that will impact around 2,100 jobs. The supermarket is to shake up its shop management roles and shut remaining counters and hot delis, on top of other measures. The counters and hot delis will close from February 26.  Tesco said all affected workers will be offered different roles within the company. However, it did not confirm the exact number of staff who work on the hot food delis and counters. Tesco also confirmed today that it will reduce the number of lead and team managers in its larger stores. The shake-up of its management structure will impact around 1,750 workers, while 350 workers will be affected by a series of localised changes. This include the closure of eight pharmacies and reduced hours at some in-store post offices.    Tesco will also remove a number of head office roles and will close the its Maintenance National Operating Centre in Milton Keynes. Again, workers will have the option to move into other vacancies across the business, the supermarket confirmed. Tesco said it will introduce around 1,800 new shift leader roles across its stores who will lead day-to-day operations. These roles will be lower paid, but managers who take the jobs will have their pay protected for two years. Jason Tarry, Tesco UK and ROI CEO said: “These are difficult decisions to make, but they are necessary to ensure we remain focused on delivering value for our customers wherever we can, as well as ensuring our store offer reflects what our customers value the most. ""Our priority is to support those colleagues impacted and help find alternative roles within our business from the vacancies and newly created roles we have available.”  Tesco first announced changes to its counters back in 2019, and says it has been reviewing them on an ""ongoing basis"" ever since. The majority of stores do not have fresh food counters as last year Tesco closed meat, fish and deli counters in more than 300 of its stores.  Reports from December 2022 said the store would axe a further 279 food counters at the beginning of this year.  In its release, the supermarket said it would continue to work with third parties to offer a counter experience in-store where it can.

Paperchase collapses into administration with 106 stores and 820 jobs at risk,"Tesco purchased the Paperchase brand and the ""intellectual property"" after the stationery chain entered administration but the move means that its 106 UK stores as well as 820 jobs are still at riskCard and stationery retailer Paperchase has collapsed into administration putting 820 jobs and 106 stores at risk.  However, in an eleventh-hour deal, Tesco has purchased the Paperchase brand and intellectual property - although the buyout doesn't include its stores. The collapse of the stationary chain is still likely to result in hundreds of jobs being lost.  Paperchase stores will remain open and trading as normal for now with shoppers urged to spend their gift cards as soon as possible. Customers have two weeks to spend their gift cards before they become worthless. The stationery giant is yet another casualty of the declining UK high street with several chains having ceased trading over the last few years.   Paperchase appointed insolvency firm Begbies Traynor as administrators this morning. A statement from Begbies Traynor said: ""On January 31 2023 Mark Fry, Kirstie Provan and Gary Shankland, of Begbies Traynor, were appointed as Joint Administrators of Aspen Phoenix Newco Limited, which trades as Paperchase. ""Unfortunately, despite a comprehensive sales process, no viable offers were received for the Company, or its business and assets, on a going concern basis. ""However, this sale reflects the interest in the well-known and established brand and will enable the brand to continue in Tesco stores across the UK."" Commenting on the announcement, Jan Marchant, managing director of home and clothing at Tesco, said: ""Paperchase is a well-loved brand by so many, and we're proud to bring it to Tesco stores across the UK. ""We have been building out plans to bring more brands and inspiration to the ranges we currently offer, and this will help us to take those plans further. We look forward to sharing more with our customers in due course."" Paperchase, which specialises in gifts and stationery, was close to falling into administration in January 2021 but was rescued by Aspen Phoenix Newco, which was backed by Permira Debt Managers. This last pre-pack administration deal saved around 1,000 jobs but around 270 jobs were lost as Paperchase had to permanently close 27 of its sites. A pre-pack administration is a procedure that allows an insolvent company to sell its assets as soon as an administrator is appointed. Paperchase changed hands again in August last year by the retail entrepreneur Steve Curtis, chair of the fashion chain Jigsaw, who was backed by Retail Realisation.

JD Sports warns 10million customers may have had data stolen after cyber attack,"Despite the hack, JD group has said payment card details were ""safe"", and that it has no reason to think the hackers have accessed users' passwordsJD Sports has warned that around 10 million people might have had their personal data stolen after it was hit by a cyber attack.  The sports retailer said the affected brands from the group are JD, Size?, Millets, Blacks, Scotts and Millet Sport. However, even with the attack the JD group has said payment card details were ""safe"" and that it has no reason to think the hackers have accessed users' passwords. But information that could have been stolen includes addresses, phone numbers and email addresses. The group announced today that the hackers had accessed a system that contained customer data relating to some online orders placed between November 2018 and October 2020.   The JD group said the intruders could have also gained access to billing, details of orders that customers have placed, and the final four digits of their payment cards in the attack.  Neil Greenhalgh, the chief financial officer of JD group apologised for the incident and said that protecting the data for its customers was an ""absolutely priority"" for the group.  He said: ""We want to apologise to those customers who may have been affected by this incident. ""We are advising them to be vigilant about potential scam emails, calls and texts and providing details on how to report these.  ""We are continuing with a full review of our cyber security in partnership with external specialists following this incident.""  The business said that it would proactively contact customers whose data might have been taken in the breach. JD Sports said it was taking the ""necessary immediate steps"" to investigate and respond to the incident, including the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), as necessary. In a statement, it said: ""We are engaging with the relevant authorities and we are proactively contacting affected customers so that we can advise them to be vigilant to the risk of fraud and phishing attacks. ""This includes being on the lookout for any suspicious or unusual communications purporting to be from JD Sports or any of our group brands."" It is the latest in a series of recent high-profile cyber attacks on British companies.  Within the last two weeks, Royal Mail had to halt deliveries overseas due to a ransomware attack, however, it was able to resume international signed deliveries for business customers last Thursday. A ransomware is malicious computer software that encrypts data and locks up systems and criminals usually demand a large payment to release the data.

"DWP rule change could see thousands of bereaved families get £10,000 payment","Bereaved families including couples who live together and have children together, but aren't married, could soon be eligible for additional financial support of up to £10,000Thousands of bereaved families could be eligible for a £10,000 payment following a major rule change. You may be able to get Bereavement Support Payment if your husband, wife or civil partner died in the last 21 months. Around 21,000 households who were previously denied support will now be able to apply for the payment. The change will also benefit a further 1,800 families each year. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has stated that the rule change will extend to couples who live together and have children together, but aren't married. The new rule expected to come into force later in the year - although it is still subject to final Parliamentary approved.    It comes following a successful debate in the House of Commons. It means thousands of families who were previously denied the benefits from August 30, 2018 will finally be able to claim for any payments. Some Brits could be eligible for backdated payments worth up to £9,800 if their partner died before the law was changed. Previously, only married parents could claim Bereavement Support Payments. The DWP will publish more details on Gov.uk in the coming weeks.  Minister for Work and Pensions Viscount Younger of Leckie said: “I am pleased to see this important change is nearing its very final steps to becoming law, so more bereaved parents can access this support.” The Bereavement Support Payment is worth up to £3,500, plus £350 a month for 18 months for those eligible. If you receive child benefits, you will receive the higher rates. But in order to receive the full amount, you must claim within the first three months of your partner's death. You can claim up to 21 months afterwards, but you will get fewer monthly payments.  You could be eligible if your partner either:  paid National Insurance contributions for at least 25 weeks in one tax year since April 6, 1975 died because of an accident at work or a disease caused by work  When they died you must have been:  under State Pension age living in the UK or a country that pays bereavement benefits  If you get Child Benefit, or do not get it but are entitled to it, you will receive the higher rate. If you do not get Child Benefit, you will get the lower rate unless you were pregnant when your husband, wife or civil partner died. Higher rate  First payment - £3,500 Monthly payments - £350  Lower rate  First payment - £2,500 Monthly payments - £100   Can I still get the payment if I did not claim the benefit before? In most cases, you’ll have to provide evidence to show a good reason why you were not able to make a claim earlier. This could be because:  You have a disability You’re unwell  The online claims system was down You’re making a new claim after breaking up with your partner  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/dwp-rule-change-could-see-29087932
"TV licence rules explained for Netflix, Amazon Prime and Sky customers","The TV licensing rules have been explained for households who also have streaming services such as Netflix, or Amazon Prime, as many have been left confused if they have to pay the £159 feeHouseholds who have a subscription with Netflix, Amazon Prime or Sky might be wondering if TV licence rules apply to them. The TV licence is a bill paid either on a monthly, quarterly or yearly basis, but some Brits have been left confused whether they have to pay it if they have additional streaming services. It is the BBC's main source of funding - providing around £3.7 billion of its £5 billion annual income. If you watch or record live TV programmes on any channel, then you'll need to pay for a TV licence.  You also need one if you use BBC iPlayer - even if only watching shows on catch up.   However, you do not need one if you're watching shows on catch-up using streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, ITVX, Disney Plus, YouTube, All 4 or My5. This applies as long as you're not watching stuff live through these services. An annual TV licence costs £159 per year. The current rate has been frozen until April 2024.  What does a TV licence cover? A single TV licence covers all of the following in a single property:   TV sets; computers;  laptops;  tablets;  mobile phones;  and any other device that can receive a TV signal   How long does a TV licence last? A TV licence is usually valid for a year after the day it is paid for.   You need to be covered by a TV licence if you watch live TV on any channel or device This includes:   If you’re watching on TV or on an online TV service;   For all channels, not just the BBC;   If you record a programme and watch it later;   If you watch a programme on a delay;  To watch or record repeats;   To watch or record programmes on +1, +2 and +24 channels;   To watch live programmes on Red Button services;   Even if you already pay for cable, satellite or other TV services;   To watch satellite or online programmes shown live from outside the UK or Channel Islands   You can be fined up to £1,000 if you watch or record live TV without a TV Licence.  You don’t need a licence to watch anything on a battery-powered device if you have a licence for your home or parents home.

Thousands of Universal Credit claimants hit by rule change today - what it means for you,"The rule change will see the so-called Administrative Earnings Threshold (AET) increased from 12 hours to 15 hours and this will affect some 120,000 people claiming Universal CreditThousands of people who claim Universal Credit will be affected by a rule change coming into force from today. Currently, benefit claimants working 12 hours a week at the National Living Wage are not required to meet regularly with their Jobcentre coach. But this threshold is being increased to 15 hours a week, or 24 hours week if you're in a couple, meaning more people will be pressured into looking for a job or increasing their hours or work. These regulations will come into force today (January 30) and the change will start impacting claimants from February 26, 2023.  The rule change to the so-called Administrative Earnings Threshold (AET) will affect some 120,000 people claiming Universal Credit.  If you’re told you need to look for work, but you fail to do so, you could risk being sanctioned and your benefits temporarily reduced or stopped.   This is the second time the AET has been increased in recent months. It was pushed up from nine hours at National Living Wage to 12 hours in September. The AET rate is currently £494 a month if you’re single or £782 if you’re claiming as a couple. This is increasing to £617 for single claimants and £988 if you’re in a couple from today. Those affected by the change will be contacted by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The AET determines which ""work group"" you’re placed in - either the “light touch” work group or “intensive work search”.  If your income is above the AET rate, you will be in the ""light touch"" work group - this means you’re not required to look for work and have less contact with the JobCentre. But if you earn below the AET rate, you will be in the ""intensive work search"" and will have more commitments to fulfil to keep your benefits. Some of the work activities that you might be asked to take part in include:  Carrying out work searches Making applications Creating and maintaining an online history Registering with an employment agency Creating and maintaining job profiles – however, you must not be mandated to use particular internet or social media sites (this must be entirely voluntary) Seeking references Any other actions which reasonably increase the likelihood of obtaining employment  Those who are unable to work due to long-term sickness or a disability are exempt from sanctions. For example if you have a joint Universal Credit claim and your partner has Limited Capability for Work so they’re not required to find a job. Another exception is if you are over the state pension age, which is currently 66. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Mel Stride MP said: ""A hallmark of a compassionate society is giving those on low incomes the tools to progress and earn more.  ""It is important that we continue to deliver targeted support so that those in work have access to the expertise and guidance of our dedicated work coaches. ""By raising the Administrative Earnings Threshold, we are forging a robust labour market building on positive changes we have already made and supporting even more people to progress in the workplace.""

Flybe collapse: What it means for flights and what you need to do to get refund,"Flybe announced it ceased trading on Saturday morning with all scheduled flights cancelled, but what does it mean for passengers stuck abroad or somewhere in the UK?Airline Flybe has ceased trading and all scheduled flights have been cancelled, leaving potentially thousands of people stranded.  Flybe was initially pushed into administration in March 2020 with the loss of 2,400 jobs as the Covid-19 pandemic destroyed large parts of the travel market. But the company's planes returned to the skies in April after its business and assets were purchased by Thyme Opco, which is linked to US hedge fund Cyrus Capital. It returned with a plan to operate up to 530 flights per week across 23 routes, serving airports such as Belfast City, Birmingham, East Midlands, Glasgow, Heathrow and Leeds Bradford. It had been based at Birmingham Airport. However, Flybe announced on Saturday morning that it has ceased trading and all flights from and to the UK operated by Flybe have been cancelled and will not be rescheduled.  Before it went bust it flew the most UK domestic routes between airports outside London. But what does this mean for Flybe customers who have already purchased tickets? The Mirror explains all. Are you a Flybe customer affected by its collapse? Let us know: webnews@mirror.co.uk   I've booked a flight - what happens now?  Both the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and Flybe have urged customers who have booked Flybe flights not to travel to airports. Instead, the CAA is advising anyone who still need to travel to make new alternative travel arrangements through other airlines, rail or coach operators. Flybe has said it is ""unfortunately not able to arrange alternative flights for passengers"" and the CAA has not announced if it will step in to repatriate stranded customers. If you booked your flight as part of a packaged holiday and you have ATOL protection, contact your travel firm and it should arrange alternative flights or give you a full refund.  Customers should continue to check the Flybe website and Civil Aviation Authority website for further information. Anyone who requires additional information or assistance is asked to contact the administrators at flybecustomers@interpathadvisory.com. CAA consumer director Paul Smith said: ""It is always sad to see an airline enter administration and we know that Flybe's decision to stop trading will be distressing for all of its employees and customers.  ""We urge passengers planning to fly with this airline not to go to the airport as all Flybe flights are cancelled.  ""For the latest advice, Flybe customers should visit the Civil Aviation Authority's website or our Twitter feed for more information."" Can I get a refund?   As we've mentioned above, customers should first check if their booking is ATOL-protected - but sadly, few people in this situation are likely to be. ATOL is the the UK holiday financial protection scheme which is run by the Government and the CAA.  Booking a holiday which is ATOL protected means UK holidaymakers will get a refund if their travel operator collapses, or if they are already abroad they will be flown home at no extra cost. ATOL protection covers flight-inclusive package holidays - so a holiday you've booked through a travel agent that normally includes things like your flight and hotel. This means if you booked just flights with Flybe - so not through a package deal, but where you're booking your flights and hotel separately - you're unlikely to be ATOL protected. Those who purchased flights on a credit card or debit card should speak to their bank about getting a refund. If you’ve made a purchase worth between £100 and £30,000 using a credit card, you can try claim a refund through Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. For debit card payments or credit card purchased under £100, you can try using Chargeback to claim back your money - but sadly this isn’t enshrined in law so there is no guarantee you'll get your money back. Those with travel insurance may be able to claim money back, although customers would usually need to have ""scheduled airline failure cover"" as part of the policy. Rory Boland, Which? travel editor, said: “This will be terrible news to Flybe passengers, many of whom used the airline regularly where it provided essential services from regional airports.  “Very few passengers flying Flybe will be on Atol protected packages so the government is unlikely to step in and repatriate those abroad or provide refunds.“ What has Flybe said?  The airline confirmed the ""sad"" move to cease trading in a statement published on Twitter on Saturday morning, noting that administrators had been brought in. ""We are sad to announce that Flybe has been placed into administration,"" Flybe tweeted. ""David Pike and Mike Pink of Interpath have been appointed administrators. Flybe has now ceased trading. All Flybe flights from and to the UK are cancelled and will not be rescheduled.""  What has the Government said?  The Government said that its ""immediate priority"" would be to support anyone trying to get home and those who have lost their jobs ""This remains a challenging environment for airlines, both old and new, as they recover from the pandemic, and we understand the impact this will have on Flybe's passengers and staff,"" a spokesperson said. ""Our immediate priority is to support people travelling home and employees who have lost their jobs. ""The Civil Aviation Authority is providing advice to passengers to help them make their journeys as smoothly and affordably as possible. ""The majority of destinations served by Flybe are within the UK with alternative transport arrangements available. ""We recognise that this is an uncertain time for affected employees and their families. ""Jobcentre Plus, through its Rapid Response Service, stands ready to support any employee affected.""

Ryanair passenger wins £400 after airline refused to give him refund during Covid,"The flight was not taken at the time as advice from the UK Government and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) was to avoid ""non-essential travel""A Ryanair passenger has been awarded £400 after arguing that Government travel advice during the Covid-19 pandemic prevented him from getting his flight.   Nick Blades, 65, from Woolaston in Gloucestershire took the discount airline to the small claims court after it refused to give him a refund for a flight he was unable to take.  First reported on the Money Saving Expert (MSE) website, Nick had booked a flight from Bristol to Malaga for July 2020.  Nick did not take the flight as at the time as advice from the UK Government and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) was to avoid ""non-essential travel"".  Nick made a complaint to the budget airline but was initially refused. He escalated his complaint further but was refused again.  Have you successfully taken a company to the small claims court? Let us know: mirror.money.saving@mirror.co.uk   According to MSE, Ryanair argued that Nick could not be refunded as the flight had not been officially cancelled. The 65-year-old decided to take the case to the Gloucester and Cheltenham County Court in August 2021 and skipped any chargeback or other external complaint route. After filing the court proceedings, Nick received a letter from Ryanair solicitors offering him a travel voucher worth £339.36 however Nick refused this offer as he wanted a cash payment.  After hearing the case, the small claims court ruled in Nick's favour and he was awarded £429, which included the price of his flight and the £90 in court fees. The MSE website said even though the case was not ""legally binding - so it doesn't set a legal precedent"" it could be used as an example of case law when bringing similar complaints to court.  How the small claims court works  Going to the small claims court should be a last resort and only after you've tried to resolve your complaint directly with a company. There are fees involved when going to the courts, starting at £35 and rising up to £455, depending on how much you’re trying to claim. But if you win your case, you should also win back these costs. If you don't win, you could end up paying legal fees for the other side - so be sure you have a good case on your hands first before going ahead with an application. You’ll need to be trying to win back £10,000 or less to open a case through the small claims court in England and Wales, or under £5,000 in Scotland or £3,000 in Northern Ireland. Another alternative is to try and claim money back through your bank - but Ryanair has previously barred people from flying with it again when they're gone down this route.

"Everything we know so far about £1,350 cost of living payments coming this year","The Government has announced there will be more cost of living payments coming this year - here's what we know so far and when payments are expected to dropCost of living payments have been a lifeline for many households in the last year and more payments are coming throughout 2023 and 2024. The idea of these payments is to try and offset rising bills, with inflation currently at 10.5% and the Bank of England predicted to raise interest rates again next week. Analysts are expecting the Bank will hike its base rate from 3% to 3.5%. Meanwhile, supermarket prices have shot up and energy bills are astronomical compared to what they used to be, with the Energy Price Guarantee set to rise from £2,500 a year for the typical household to £3,000 from April. If you're worried about soaring costs, here is what we know so far and when payments are expected to drop into bank accounts.   How much will the cost of living payments be?  There will be another cost of living payment for people on means-tested benefits and the amount to be awarded will be higher compared to last year. Households who are eligible will receive £900, split over three payments, compared to the previous £650 cost of living payment they received in 2022. The Government has also announced another £150 payment for over six million disabled people and another £300 for over eight million pensioners.  The £300 pensioner payment will be delivered on top of their Winter Fuel Payments. Who will get the next cost of living payments? The Government says that eight million people on means-tested benefits will receive the extra financial help.  This was the same figure as the first £650 payment. You should receive the money if you claim:  Income-based jobseeker’s allowance Income-related employment and support allowance Income support Pension credit Tax credits (child tax credit and working tax credit) Universal Credit  However, the Government has not revealed the ""qualifying window"" for when you need to be claiming these benefits by.

Nando's hikes its prices by 16% with a quarter chicken now costing £1.70 extra,"In January 2022 diners could order the quarter chicken for £4.25, or £8.75 with two sides. But those prices have now jumped to £4.95 and £9.95 - increases of 16% and 14%Chicken chain Nando’s has hiked its prices by 16% - just a year after an 8% increase. A quarter chicken dish is an extra £1.70 despite worldwide revenue leaping to more than £1billion last year. Bosses put the price hikes down to an increase in the cost of ingredients and running their restaurants – and warn 2023 could be another volatile year.  In January 2022 diners could order the quarter chicken for £4.25, or £8.75 with two sides. But those prices have now jumped to £4.95 and £9.95 - increases of 16% and 14%. Similarly, the half chicken dish was £7.95 a year ago or £12.45 with two sides – but it now costs £8.50 on its own or £13.50 with extras – increases of 7% to 8%.   Ten chicken wings have gone up a similar amount from £10.95 to £11.75 on their own or from £15.45 to £16.75 with two sides, while the whole chicken dish has risen 3% from £14.50 to £14.95. Delivery prices have also been hiked. A year ago, a full chicken platter to eat at home cost £24.95. But the same dish has soared to £27.75 – 11% more. The latest price hike is a blow to diners already facing a seismic squeeze in living costs.  Mum-of-two Sheila Thompson, 46, from Buxton, Derbys, said: “Nando’s used to be an affordable treat but the way it is going we are going to have to look at dining out elsewhere.”  Nando’s chiefs have admitted suffering “significantly higher levels of cost inflation” linked to soaring energy prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  Financial analyst Susannah Streeter said: “Restaurants have been battered by higher costs, with essentials rising sharply. Chicken prices have risen by 27% over the year, vegetable fat by 34%, cheese by 28% and bread by 20%.  “Trips to favourite restaurants may have to be fewer and far between.” Nando’s has 457 UK branches after opening its first in Ealing, west London, in 1992. The firm said some prices remained the same while others “had to change” due to higher costs. A spokesman added: “We continue to work hard to absorb costs wherever we can and are committed to delivering the best value possible for customers.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/nandos-hikes-prices-20-quarter-29074809
Five reasons why your Universal Credit could be cut or stopped - how to avoid them,"Millions of people get a monthly boost to their income from Universal Credit - however, sometimes these payments can be reduced or even stopped and it's important you know whyUniversal Credit is a payment by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for people who are on a low income or out of work.  The payment includes support for the cost of housing, children and childcare, and financial support for people with disabilities, carers and people too ill to work. How much you can claim is dependent on your personal circumstances such as your living arrangements or your employment status and these are assessed each month by the DWP. Sometimes, your payment may be reduced or even temporarily stopped due to specific reasons and it is important that you are aware of these. We explain five reasons why your Universal Credit could be temporary paused or stopped altogether.   Your earnings have increased  If you’re employed, your Universal Credit can be affected and reduced depending on how much you earnings. As your income increases, your monthly payment for Universal Credit can get reduce until you are earning enough to no longer need the financial support. Under what's called the ""taper rate"" for every £1 you earn your payment reduces by 55p.  Once you earn too much your claim will close but you should be informed about this before it happens.  If your circumstances change within six months of your last Universal Credit claim, then you can reapply. Some people are able to earn more money while on Universal Credit due to the ""work allowance"". This is a set amount you can earn before your benefits start to be reduced.  You will qualify for the work allowance if:  You are responsible for a child or young person You have a disability or health condition that affects your ability to work  If you get help with housing costs, your work allowance is currently £344, or if you don’t get help, the work allowance is £573.   You've reported a change in circumstances The DWP pays Universal Credit is based on your personal circumstances. So if certain changes happen in your life, then you will need to report them to the DWP as it might affect how much you can claim.  Not all changes in circumstances will result in your Universal Credit is reduced - some may actually increase your payments. If you don't report the change straight away, your claim might be reduced or stopped.  If you give incorrect information, and if you deliberately don’t report changes, you are committing benefit fraud. Changes listed online that Universal Credit expects you to tell it about include:  Finding or finishing a job Having a child Moving in with your partner Starting to care for a child or disabled person Changing your mobile number or email address Moving to a new address Changing your bank details Your rent going up or down Changes to your health condition Becoming too ill to work or meet your work coach Changes to your earnings (only if you’re self-employed) Changes to your savings, investments and how much money you have Changes to your immigration status, if you’re not a British citizen  You can report a change of circumstances by signing in to your Universal Credit account. You've had an overpayment If the DWP has paid you too much Universal Credit, the department will take back the money from your future payments. If you do not tell the DWP about the overpayment you may be prosecuted for benefit fraud or have to pay a penalty if you do not tell benefit providers about overpayments You can report an overpayment by signing into your Universal Credit account or calling the Universal Credit helpline. You can try asking the DWP if they will let you not pay back the overpayment.  This is called ""exercising their discretion not to recover an overpayment"" but they don't have to agree to this.  You've been sanctioned  To get Universal Credit payments, you’ll need to accept an agreement called a ""claimant commitment"".  This is a list of things you promise to do to get the payments.  By agreeing, it means you prepare for and look for work if you aren't working and will increase your earnings if you are already working. If you are not showing that you are doing this by recording your job searches, or your Jobcentre work coach doesn't feel you are doing enough to get back into work, then you could be sanctioned. Getting a sanction means your Universal Credit payment will be temporarily reduced and you will be notified of it if it happens.  This will be in a letter or, if you use the digital service, posted on your Universal Credit online account and will tell you:   why you’ve received a sanction  the level of sanction you’ve been given  how long the sanction will last  how much money will be taken away from your Universal Credit payment  the date the sanction decision was made  There are different sanctions depending on which ""conditionality group"" you’re in and these groups just highlight what work-related activities you have to do in order to get a full entitlement to Universal Credit.  There are four levels for a sanction from higher to lowest, and the sanctions can last from seven days right up to 182 days.  You owe the DWP money from a loan If you've taken out an advance payment, hardship payment or budgeting advance, then this will come out of your future Universal Credit payments. That's because these are all technically loans, so they need to be paid back to the DWP.  Advance payment is money awarded to new claimants to help them cover their bills while they wait for their application to go through. A budgeting advance is one-off payment for things like home repairs or uniform for a new job.  A hardship payment is given to those who've been sanctioned and are struggling with their lower Universal Credit payment. How long you'll have to pay back these payments for depends on how much you borrowed. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/five-reasons-your-universal-credit-29058418
Barclays announces closure of 15 branches across UK - see if your bank is affected,"The 15 branch closures from Barclays comes days after NatWest said it is closing 23 branches, and over a week since Lloyds Banking Group said it is shutting 40 Halifax and Lloyds sitesBarclays has announced the closure of 15 branches across the country - meaning over 100 banks are going to shut down so far this year. The bank is set to close 14 branches across England and one in Wales from late April to the first few days on May. Sites in London, Gosport, Bridgwater and St Helens are among those shutting down over just a few days.  Barclays has already announced 15 closures earlier this month. It comes days after NatWest said it is closing 23 branches, and over a week since Lloyds Banking Group said it is shutting 40 Halifax and Lloyds sites. At the time the company blamed footfall, which has been rapidly decreasing since the onset of online banking and dropped further during the pandemic.   Lloyds said the number of customers visiting the branches it plans to close had dropped by 60% on average over the last five years. Nationwide also announced the closure of a branch in Kingswood, Gloucestershire. It means the total number of high street bank branches closing this year is already at 103. Jenny Ross, Which? money editor, said: ""While many consumers have embraced digital banking, there are still millions, including the elderly, vulnerable and isolated, who aren't yet ready or willing to make that switch - and they must be protected.  ""Our figures show how the number of bank branches and free-to-use ATMs has been slashed in recent years, so it's vital that new legislation protects free access to cash for the millions of people who rely on it.

Energy prepayment meters: Everything you need to know and your rights explained,"Consumer rights expert Martyn James explains everything you need to know about energy prepayment meters amid a worrying rise of more people being moved over to themPrepayment energy meters are back in the news at the moment for all the wrong reasons. The Mirror reported on the problem with prepayment meters last week, but we've been deluged with enquiries this morning when news broke that British Gas had suspended forcing people on to prepayment meters. It comes after an investigation by The Times claimed debt agents the firm used were caught forcibly entering the homes of vulnerable customers to install these meters.  I've been warning about forced meter replacements for years - but most people I speak to aren't aware that this can happen.  Sadly, all a firm needs to do to change your meter is apply for a court order to enter a property. Once granted, they can enter your property even if you are not in.    The main issue is - is this even appropriate given the energy price crisis - and has the firm done this as a last resort (as it is supposed to) or has it jumped the gun?  In one shocking case I saw last year, a young family found their meter had been changed forcibly while they were on holiday - but the energy firm had got the wrong house!  Needless to say, this kind of error is rare but totally unacceptable. So why is this so controversial and what’s the problem with prepayment meters? Here’s my guide.  What is a prepayment meter?  It helps to think of prepayment meters as the ""pay as you go"" option for energy use, which is how they’re often described. I’m not a fan of this term as it makes it sound like the meters are a lifestyle option, rather than something people are forced on to, or inherit if they move. With a prepayment meter, you pay for gas and/or electricity in advance, usually through a key (more of a plastic USB stick) or a card. You top up the key or card with credit at a paypoint and insert it in to the meter to ‘load’ it with the credit. It’s estimated that around four million households currently have prepayment meters.    What are the main problems?  It goes without saying that the obvious problem with prepayment is when you run out of credit, your supply cuts out. You will usually have a small amount of emergency credit to get you through a short timeframe, but as with bank overdrafts, people tend to use this emergency credit as the norm. The other big problem is you are reliant on leaving your home and going to a shop to top up the card. PayPoint and Payzone outlets are available at thousands of places around the UK, including many that are open late or all night, but if your local shop is closed then things can spiral out of control quickly. You can also have problems with wonky cards or keys that aren’t loading the credit. If you are out of credit, things get complicated. You’ll need to contact the energy provider to see if they can give you temporary credit, that they can upload to the meter remotely. However, now you are in debt, you’ll have to pay some of that debt back every time you top up the meter. So if you have the same amount of money coming in each week or month, you’ll have less to spend in real terms on energy because of reducing that debt.   What happens if I keep running out of credit?  What happens next is rather murky. If you are continually in debt then the energy firm’s debt management procedures should kick in. If you are classified as vulnerable, then they should have identified this – but I’m regularly contacted by people who have slipped through the net, so don’t assume that this is the case. There are various options available depending on your circumstances. But energy firms are notoriously tight lipped about the circumstances under which they cut people off. While I’m assured that this is ""exceptionally rare"" it does happen.  You can find out more about your rights if you are out of credit on a prepayment meter in this great guide from Citizens Advice.  The Mirror reported earlier this month that 3.2 million people were effectively cut off (albeit temporarily) due to running out of energy credit last year.  What worries me is many people will simply conclude they can’t afford their energy costs and suffer without it, rather than seek help – and the news is full of horror stories of people who had done just that.    Social stigma and higher prices  Prepayment meters carry a great deal of social stigma, often unfairly. The meters are usually installed when people fall in to debt with their energy provider – in theory to help them ""manage their debts"" or so the industry likes to tell me. I don’t buy this for two reasons. Prepayment meters effectively cut off your supply if you don’t pay enough cash, marginalising people struggling financially. And outrageously, it costs more money to run a prepayment meter. The usual reason I’m given for this is the extra costs of running prepayment meters to suppliers. But that leaves a distinctly unpleasant taste in my mouth. Far too often, people struggling pay more for services that they should have to. It’s more expensive to borrow cash from lenders too if you have bad credit (another unacceptable way businesses operate). I’d argue it makes sense to spread these costs over all energy customers rather than charge people in financial difficulties more. Tell your MP if you agree. Another frustration with prepayment meters is they disproportionately affect renters – again, among the most financially challenged in these current market conditions. Some landlords won’t let their new tenants shift from a prepayment meter, usually because of bad experiences with the old tenants. If you’re thinking about moving in to a new property where this has happened, insist on the prepayment meter being removed as part of the deal – after all, you’ll inevitably had a credit check as part of the application.   How do I switch my meter to one that bills me regularly?  The good news is you can switch from a prepayment to a standard meter for free. The bad news is there’s sometimes a backlog of requests, available meters and engineers to do the work. The push to get the nation on to smart meters may have been scaled back but it is still underway, which has contributed to the wait to get the meter changed.  So while it’s not a great time to switch energy providers to get a better tariff, it is a good time to call around to see how quickly each one can get you a new meter.   What help is there if you are struggling?  There are a complicated series of benefits, grants and other support available for people who are older, vulnerable or in financial difficulties.  The regulator Ofgem has a list of all of the options available.   The vast range of options are also covered in plain English here with Citizens Advice.  If you are in financial difficulties Ofgem says that you can ask for the following:  A review of your payments and debt repayments Payment breaks or reductions More time to pay Access to hardship funds Advice on how to use less energy The option to go on the Priority Services Register – a free support service for a wide range of people struggling or who need support  Once again, I’m hearing that people are getting a rather mixed bag of options when they seek help. So don’t be afraid to push back and ask for the proposals in writing. If you feel that the business is not listening or helping – or they are making things worse - then you can take your complaint to the Energy Ombudsman for free. Make it clear to the business that you expect them to take no action against you while the matter is looked in to by the ombudsman. It’s been suggested by the Government that there is a need for cheaper ""social tariffs"" for people who fall in to these categories but as yet, these have not been agreed. So watch this space and the Mirror team will keep you updated with all the new energy developments as they happen.

"'I make up to £1,000 a month through selling on eBay - here's how you can too'","As an experienced seller on eBay, this January James set himself a target to make £1,000 through decluttering and selling his unwanted stuffOne man is getting through the cost of living crisis by selling unwanted items on eBay and says he can make up to £1,000 a month. James McHutchison, 31, from Kent, is an experienced seller on the second-hand site, with some of his most successful auctions including a French watch that sold for £470. James told Mirror Money that January is the best time to go through all your unwanted belongings and sell them online to make some extra cash after Christmas. Of course, how much you could make depends on what you have to flog. He said: ""Everybody ends up accumulating a lot of unnecessary stuff over Christmas, so I think January is the perfect time to wipe the slate clean and sort out what you really need.”   Some of the hidden gems James had managed to sell include everything from clothes, watches and books, to a bathroom extractor fan and a Nintendo Switch. James said: “I found some things in my garage that I hadn’t touched for over three years, along with more recent purchases that I just don’t use. ""I have to admit that I’m a bit of a hoarder, but I never realised just how much stuff I had laying around that could make me a bit of money and also be useful to others.” James' biggest sales include two high-end watches that he did not wear which he managed to sell for £470 and £464.40 after listing them on the site. Overall, these two listings alone made him £934.   James noted that the two items which gave him the most ""unexpected profit"" were a Swiss watch rubber strap which he sold for £83 and a model of a Bentley Car which he sold for £72.  Two other profitable items were his Nintendo Switch which James managed to sell for £120 and a Car Dash Cam which went for £110.  James said he was a ""strong believer"" that any unused item is worth selling, even if you’re sceptical of its value.  He added: “Times are tough at the moment, so whether you’re making £1 or £100, every little helps and can help you on your way to paying your bills or going on your dream holiday.  ""Plus, you never know just how much an object may end up making! For me, selling on eBay is a no-brainer. It’s a win-win situation as you can make a bit of extra cash and also free up some space around your house! ” If you want to start making some extra cash by selling your unwanted stuff, James says you should go for it, particularly if you have more unusual and unique items.  He added: ""“Unique and quirky items are often what I end up selling for the most, so don’t be put off listing them!"" ""Most recently I’ve sold items like watch straps and watch brochures, which were so niche that I was unsure if they’d even sell. In fact, my Swiss Watch Rubber strap sold for £83, which was a lot more than I’d anticipated."" If you are diving into second-hand sales, James advises you to browse the site for similar items so you can gauge how much you should price your listing.  He said: “I sell a lot of different things, and valuing them can be a daunting task, especially if they are more obscure. I always browse eBay to see what similar items are selling for, but if I’m still stuck I use eBay’s pricing recommendation tool. ""It saves a lot of time and gives you a recommended price range, depending on different factors. You then have the option to decide the most reasonable final price for it.” On top of this, the 31-year-old said you should always be wary about when you should put up your listing as it can make a huge difference to your sale. He added: ""I tend to list my items on Sunday evenings when I think people are more likely to be online shopping.” Some of the items James has sold on eBay:   Keyring - 97p Watch bracelet - £2.20  Swiss watch brochure - £2.20 Swiss watch guide - £5.50 Swiss watch book - £7.50 Bathroom extractor fan - £12 Model Bentley Car - £72 Swiss watch rubber strap - £83 Car dash cam - £110 Nintendo Switch - £120 Swiss watch - £464.40 French watch - £470  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/i-make-up-1000-month-29065271
Full list of DWP payments you could get in February including £150 one-off help,"State support for those struggling with the rising cost of living will continue throughout February and Mirror Money has compiled a full list of what help is available over the next monthAs the cost of living crisis continues to rage on, belts will continue to be tightened as finances are strained over the next few weeks. Energy bills are still at the highest level they have ever been and inflation is currently at 10.5% - way above the Bank of England target of 2%. Meanwhile, interest rates are expected to be increased again next week - with analysts expecting a rise from 3.5% to 4%. Even with this bleak outlook, there is a glimmer of hope for many as more state support is to going to continue to be delivered throughout February. Mirror Money has compiled a full list of that support.    Energy discount payment Once again, millions of households across the UK will receive a £67 discount on their monthly energy bill.  The scheme was announced by the former Chancellor and current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak last year and gives households £400 off their energy bill until March. The discount started in October last year and is being paid to consumers in instalments over six months, with the grants administered through energy suppliers. If you pay your bills by direct debit you will receive the discount automatically – either as a deduction to your monthly payments or as a refund to your bank account.   The discount is provided monthly, regardless of whether you pay bills monthly or quarterly or have an associated payment card. It breaks down into instalments of £66 in October and November 2022 and to £67 per month from December until March 2023. The next one will be paid in February. If your energy bills are on receipt of an invoice, you will see the discount applied as credit to your energy account every month. Smart prepayment meter customers will also receive the discount automatically and prepay customers are sent discount vouchers by text, email or post that they will need to redeem. This scheme has not been extended like other cost of living support and will come to an end in March, so from April you will have to pay your energy bill in full.  Cold Weather Payment scheme This scheme opened in November and will continue to run until March 31 of this year. If you're eligible, you will get £25 for each seven-day period when temperatures drop below zero degrees in your area. To get this money you must be claiming one of six types of benefits, these include:  Pension Credit Income Support (if you have any of the following: disability or pensioner premium, a child who is disabled, Child Tax Credit that includes a disability or severe disability element or a child under five living with you) Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance (if you have any of the following: disability or pensioner premium, a child who is disabled, Child Tax Credit that includes a disability or severe disability element or a child under five living with you) Income-related Employment and Support Allowance (if you have any of the following: severe or enhanced disability premium, a pensioner premium, a child who is disabled, Child Tax Credit that includes a disability or severe disability element or a child under five living with you) Universal Credit (if you are not employed or self-employed, and you have a health condition or disability and have limited capability for work, or you have a child under five living with you) Support for Mortgage Interest (if you have any of the following: severe or enhanced disability premium, a pensioner premium, a child who is disabled, Child Tax Credit that includes a disability or severe disability element or a child under five living with you)   The payment should be made automatically within 14 working days, and you can receive multiple Cold Weather Payments if there are several spells of freezing weather.  You can check if you're due a payment by searching you postcode in the Government's online checker tool.  It must be noted that Cold Weather Payments are not available in Scotland any more, instead, you might be able to claim an annual £50 Winter Heating Payment.   Warm Home Discount scheme This is a Government-backed scheme to help reduce costs if you’re on low income, getting certain benefits and struggling to pay your electricity or gas bills.  The Warm Home Discount will give you £150 off your electricity bill between October 2022 and March 2023, if you qualify but the money is not paid to your bank account.  Instead, a discount is paid directly into your energy account, by your supplier and if you are on a prepay meter, you're usually sent a top-up voucher. You could get also money off your gas bill if your supplier provides you with both gas and electricity, this is known as a dual fuel tariff.  You might be able to get a Warm Home discount if you fall into one of two core groups in England and Wales.   Core group 1. If you get the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit Core group 2. If you’re on a low income, and getting certain means-tested benefit  In Scotland, these groups are called the ""Core Group"" and the ""Broader Group"". For this year's payment, the qualifying date was August 21, 2022.  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/full-list-payments-you-could-29064150
Tesco issues one-month warning to every shopper with a Clubcard before points expire,"Tesco vouchers are valid for two years and are sent out by the supermarket every three months, in February, May, August and November - the next batch is running out on February 28, 2023Tesco shoppers have just over one month left to spend £16million worth of Clubcard vouchers. The vouchers were issued in February 2021 and will expire on February 28, 2023.  Tesco vouchers are valid for two years and are sent out by the supermarket every three months, in February, May, August and November.  Supermarket shoppers build up Clubcard points every time they spend money in Tesco stores or online. For every £1 you spend on everyday grocery items, you get one point added to your Clubcard balance.   If you fill up at a Tesco pump, every £2 you spend is worth one point. Tesco shoppers can also collect points through Tesco Bank and Tesco Mobile as well. You need a minimum of 150 points to get any sort of Clubcard voucher, which will be worth £1.50 to spend in Tesco. But there is a way to triple your points. Points can also be redeemed for up to three times their value if you cash them in to be spent at a Tesco Clubcard reward partner. Some examples of companies where you can spend your vouchers at triple their value include Thorpe Park, Pizza Express and the RAC. Tash Whitmey, Tesco loyalty director, said: “We want to help customers’ household budgets stretch further right now and Clubcard is the best way to get great value with Tesco – from Clubcard Rewards to thousands of exclusive deals through Clubcard Prices. “With more than £16million worth of Clubcard vouchers due to expire at the end of February, we’re reminding customers to spend them in what can be a tough time of year, as family budgets feel the new year strain.”   How to check your Clubcard balance  You can check your Clubcard balance by logging into the Tesco Clubcard website with your account details. Once you are logged in, click on “my Clubcard account” and then “vouchers” and you should see a table listing the vouchers you still have to spend. You can spend any leftover vouchers online straight away, or print them out from home if you would rather use them in store. If yours are close to expiring, but you do not want to spend them just yet, there is a trick to extend them. Turn your coupons into Faster Vouchers and they will last 21 months from the date you convert your vouchers. This means you could get an extra 21 months use out of them beyond the usual two-year expiry date. Tesco has around 20 million Clubcard members.

But you don’t get them with a breakfast at the moment??"" Another added: ""Extremely disappointing breakfast @tobycarvery in Hemel this morning.  ""No breakfast Yorkshires. No fried eggs. Hash browns clearly leftovers from yesterday. And why do i have to pay an additional fee for my son to have cereal?"" Toby Carvery told The Mirror some restaurants are offering scrambled eggs instead of fried eggs. A spokesperson said: ""Like many restaurants, unfortunately Toby Carvery too has experienced a short term problem in relation to shelled egg supply.  ""As a temporary measure in January we have offered our breakfast guests scrambled eggs as an alternative, but expect fried eggs to be back on the menu again soon.” The cost of eggs has become a hot topic at the moment after the Consumer Price Index revealed that the price has skyrocketed by 60% over the last year. The Grocer magazine said a third of eggs in the biggest nine supermarkets leapt in price in the past month.  The largest hike it saw was a six-pack of free-range eggs at Asda, up 18% to £1.95, making it 30% dearer than at the start of 2022. Alongside bird flu, egg prices have also risen due to the war in Ukraine as the cost of energy and chicken feed prices as risen significantly.  In November last year, a third of farmers surveyed by the trade body the British Free Range Egg Producers Association (BFREPA) reported they had reduced the number of hens in their flock because egg prices meant they were unable to cover their costs. A quarter of the 165 farmers who responded told the BFREPA they had stopped production either temporarily or permanently due to this. There are currently 153 Toby Carvery sites across the UK and you can out where your nearest branch is and what time it opens by visiting the Toby Carvery website.

"Oil giants making 'obscene' £5,000 profit a second while millions struggle to heat homes","Five of the world's biggest oil companies are expected to reveal profits equating to £5,000 a second between them while millions continue to struggle with rising energy billsOil giants have been slammed for preparing to announce an ""obscene"" £160billion profit bonanza when households are battling to make ends meet. Five of the world’s biggest producers will over the next fortnight reveal just how much they raked in last year. Analysts predict the annual haul will have doubled, on the back of sky-high energy prices that are causing misery for households and businesses. The forecast combined profits for BP, Shell, along with US heavyweights Chevron and ExxonMobil, and France’s TotalEnergies would equate to more than £5,000 a second.   US heavyweight Chevron kicked the reporting season off yesterday by announcing record annual profits of £28.6billion, a big rise the £12.6billion it made in 2021. Mike Wirth, Chevron’s chairman and chief executive, insisted it was ""investing to grow both traditional and new energy supplies to meet increasing demand for affordable, reliable, and ever-cleaner energy."" Rival US goliath ExxonMobil is predicted to announce profits of around £47.2billion on Tuesday. Attention then switches across the Atlantic on Thursday with Shell forecast to have made about £31billion.  The following weeks is expected to see BP reveal it made around £22.4billon, and French giant TotalEnergies £29billion. Alice Harrison, from the group Global Witness, said: ""In the midst of an acute energy affordability crisis that has forced over seven million UK homes into fuel poverty, the largest Western oil majors are anticipated to record staggering yearly profits of around £160billion."" ""Let’s not forget that these companies are richer because the rest of us are poorer. ""Brits should be asking themselves whose side their government is on? Those of us living in cold, draughty homes or an industry that’s riding the wave of the energy crisis and returning billions to its shareholders.""  ""If the profits of these companies were properly taxed, our government could free up money that’s desperately needed to rebuild this country – from giving Brits adequate and long-term support with the cost of their energy bills, to giving NHS nurses on the picket lines the pay raises they deserve."" Tessa Khan, executive director of fellow campaign group Uplift. said: ""These are profits that the oil and gas industry is taking from us in higher energy and fuel bills: from pensioners, families with children, UK businesses. ""They are profiteering while British people are struggling. It’s obscene."" Under pressure, the Government announced an increased windfall tax on North Sea producers last year.  Shell has already said it expects to pay around £1.7billion in such taxes for the final three months of last year. Yet it came after bosses at the London-listed multinational said in October it had not paid any UK windfall taxes due to heavy investment in the North Sea. Last year’s profits could make something of a high point, as wholesale gas prices have fallen sharply in recent months and oil prices are some way their previous peaks.  The oil companies also argue that profits now compare wit heavy losses at the start of the Covid crisis. Susannah Streeter, senior investments and markets analyst at broker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Oil prices are hovering around $86 a barrel, well down from the spikes to above $120 last summer, ""However, energy prices are still elevated by historical standards and so these are still buoyant times.""

"'More pain to come' for Brits as mortgage rates rise, former Bank of England chief warns","Andy Haldane has predicted that inflation will cause real wages to fall once again this year, spelling out yet more trouble for Brits during the cost of living crisisA former Bank of England bigwig warned of “more pain to come” for millions of households from rising mortgage costs. Andy Haldane, who was the Bank’s chief economist until 2021, predicted real wages would fall again this year because of the impact of punishingly high inflation. The Bank of England is forecast to hike its main interest rate from 3.5% to 4% next week to try to cool inflation, which has begun to ease. That will hit millions of borrowers with variable rate mortgages and those looking for new home loans. But Mr Haldane, now chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts, said: “It is painful and I fear there is more pain to come as those mortgage rate rises from last year begin to hit people’s bank accounts over this year.”    High street bank TSB yesterday announced it was setting aside £55m for loans that might turn sour because of the worsening economy and the cost of living crisis. But the lender said it had yet to see a marked increase in customers ­experiencing financial difficulties or missing payments.  Boss Robin Bulloch said: “The resilience of customers is quite remarkable.”  Mr Haldane, interviewed on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, said: “The terrible double whammy of first Covid, and then the cost of living crisis, has and is causing huge amounts of financial stress for many businesses, many households and of course charities. “We’ve had a lost decade and a half in terms of pay rises in inflation-adjusted terms. “Last year we saw real pay fall and we are most likely to see that same happen again and that is putting acute financial stress and indeed mental stress on a great many ­households.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/more-pain-come-brits-mortgage-29061330
"New rare error £2 coin found by experts and it could be worth £2,000","This particular error coin has seen the design accidentally minted on one type of metal - so it appears all in one colour instead of having a gold-coloured outer ring and silver-coloured centreA new £2 error coin “never seen before” by experts is being flogged online for £2,000.  The coin in question was released in 2022 to celebrate 150 years of the FA Cup.  Like all £2 coins, which are bi-metallic, the design features the standard gold-coloured ring outside made of Nickel-brass and a silver-coloured centre made of Cupro-nickel. But this particular error coin has seen the design accidentally minted on one type of metal - so it appears all in one colour. The coin still features an image of the FA Cup trophy and the dates 1871-1872 and 2021-2022 and has is being sold in the original collective pack issued by the Royal Mint.   The owner of the rare £2 has listed it on eBay with an asking price of £2,000. A description of the coin reads: “Rare Mono Error Coin 2022 FA Cup £2 Royal Mint Coin Bunc. “Rare error straight from the mint this mono £2 coin is basically all gold missing the silver bit. Never seen another.""   Colin Bellamy, owner of change checking website Coin Hunter, said: “I think it’s a great find – single metal £2 coin errors are very rare. “What adds to the appeal here is the subject matter and the fact it passed inspection at The Royal Mint to be sealed in a pack and sent out to a customer.” Coins that have been made with mistakes on them are called ""error coins"" and are extremely valuable to collectors. This is because they could be only one of a handful, or one of a kind - so they're hard to find.    You should always be wary and do your research first before buying any coin on eBay, as there are fakes floating around.   Websites and Facebook groups from change experts like Coin Hunter can help you work out if a coin is the real deal or not.  You can also ask the Royal Mint to verify coins.

Best and worst banks based on switches from Santander to Monzo and HSBC - see full list,"The latest current account switch data is in from Pay.UK - but where are people switching to, and which banks are being ditched? See the full list below and tell us what you thinkSantander, HSBC and Starling Bank attracted more customers compared to rival banks in the last three months of 2022, according to the latest switch data. In the last three months of 2022, Santander had the highest net switching gains with 29,105, followed by HSBC with 13,119 and then Starling Bank with 9,070. Monzo Bank and Nationwide were in fourth and fifth place with 6,038 and 3,248 respectively. Pay.UK noted that at least two digital banks have appeared in the ""top five"" performing current account providers in each quarter of 2022 despite the lack of incentive programmes. This suggests that for many end-users, mobile banking and mobile app ease-of-use were important. Have you had trouble switching bank accounts? Let us know: mirror.money.saving@mirror.co.uk   At the opposite end of the table, Barclays saw the most net switching losses with -18,646.  This was followed by Natwest with -11,525 in second-to-last place, then TSB with -10,400, Lloyds Bank with -4,928, and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) with -4,831.  The top reasons customers gave for preferring their new current accounts included online banking facilities (46%) followed by customer service (42%) and mobile banking/banking app ease (40%). However, the interest rate gained through a current account continues to be the fourth most important factor, with one in four noting this was a reason for them preferring their new account.  The number of people switching their bank accounts through the Current Account Switching Service (CASS) reached its highest level since its launch. Between October and December last year, Pay.UK saw 376,107 use the CASS service, this was up from the 222,108 switches it had conducted in the previous quarter between July and September. Monthly switching volumes peaked in November at 157,376, the highest ever recorded and when compared to the same period in 2021 a volume increase of 73%.   October and December had 118,427 and 100,304 switches respectively.  Pay.UK said the high switching totals may signal that consumers and businesses across the UK are reassessing their current account options during the challenging economic climate, looking to accounts that offer services that suit them better or provide switching incentives.  The high totals at the end of 2022 aligned with a number of strong incentives and offers from current account providers at the time.  David Piper, head of payments operations at Pay.UK, owner and operator of CASS said: “It is encouraging to see the highest level of switches ever this quarter, demonstrating the continued relevance of the service to consumers and businesses across the UK.""

NatWest to shut 23 more bank branches this year - see full list of closures,"The closures, which are scheduled to take place from April to June, are down to more people banking online and come on top of 43 NatWest branches already earmarked to close this yearNatWest is to shut 23 more bank branches this year in another blow for the high street. The closures, which are scheduled to take place from April to June, are down to more people banking online. It comes on top of the 43 banks NatWest already had scheduled to shut this year, including 13 that have already closed this month. If your local bank is shutting and you need face-to-face support, NatWest runs mobile branches at various locations throughout the year. These can be used for basic services, like making deposits, paying bills and withdrawing cash.   NatWest also works with other UK banks to open shared banking hubs on a set day each week, where again you can use basic services. You can find your nearest mobile branch or banking hub on the NatWest website. You can also access certain facilities at Post Office branches including cash and cheque deposits, checking your balance and withdrawing cash. A NatWest spokesperson said: “As with many industries, most of our customers are shifting to mobile and online banking, because it’s faster and easier for people to manage their financial lives.  “We understand and recognise that digital solutions aren’t right for everyone or every situation, and that when we close branches we have to make sure that no one is left behind. “We take our responsibility seriously to support the people who face challenges in moving online, so we are investing to provide them with support and alternatives that work for them.” The update from NatWest comes just days after Lloyds and Halifax announced they will shut another 40 banks this year.

Virgin Media to hike broadband and TV prices by 13.8% - adding £80 a year to bills,"Virgin Media says it will start telling customers how much extra they will pay and when to expect their bills to rise in the coming weeks and those who do not want to stay can cancel their contract within 30 days of the noticeVirgin Media is hiking the price of its for broadband, TV and fixed-line phone services by an average of 13.8%. The price changes will vary according to the package and the increase will come into effect on either April 1 or May 1, again depending on your current deal. In the latest Virgin Media financial results, the average customer spent £48.19 a month - so with an increase of 13.8%, that would be an increase of £6.65 a month, or £79.90 a year. The firm says it will start telling customers how much extra they will pay and when to expect their bills to rise in the coming weeks. Virgin said that customers impacted by the changes will have 30 days from receipt of their communication to cancel their contract if they wish to.   There are some users who won't be affected by the hike, with Virgin confirming that the most vulnerable users will not see their prices change in 2023. This includes those on our Essential Broadband packages, for people receiving Universal Credit, as well as Talk Protected landline customers. Virgin Mobile customers can expect price rises as well, although how much bills will rise by won't be revealed until next month. The price rise for mobile customers will be based on the January Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation figure, published in February, plus an additional 3.9% on top. RPI currently stands at 13.4%, compared to 10.5% for Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation.  A Virgin Media spokesperson said: “We know that price rises are never welcome, particularly right now, but like many other businesses we are experiencing significantly increased costs while investing to keep pace with growing demand, as broadband usage rose more than 10% last year and speeds increased by 40%. “The introduction of inflation-linked price changes, which comes into effect in 2024 when RPI is projected to be at around 1.5%, will give customers clarity and certainty about what to expect from their bills while fuelling the investment required both now and in future."" Virgin are not the only firm to announce price rises.  BT, EE, Plusnet, Shell, TalkTalk and Vodafone are all on track to increase home internet bills by inflation-busting figures.  These rises come even after the regulator Ofcom warned UK telecoms providers to ""consider whether large price rises can be justified at a time of exceptional financial hardship"".  The regulator is, however, currently taking a look at this area and at the same time, the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) is considering new guidance that could require information about mid-contract prices hikes to be made much clearer.

"Asda forcing 4,000 workers to lower paid roles with hundreds more jobs at risk","Asda has revealed a raft of changes to store operations and has confirmed that hundreds of other job roles at riskAsda has announced a huge shake-up of its business that will affect thousands of workers. The supermarket is to move more than 4,000 night workers to lower-paid daytime roles, while almost 300 roles across the company are under threat of being axed. The big four chain has proposed to move overnight restocking shifts at 184 of its smaller superstore sites over to the daytime, with staff restocking ambient products between 7pm and midnight, and frozen products between 7am and 1pm instead. The exact sites affected have not been confirmed by Asda.  This move puts around 211 night shift manager roles at risk, the supermarket said. The changes will also affect around 4,137 hourly-paid workers, who will be moved to daytime hours with less pay. Their shift patterns being moved to daytime means workers lose their night shift pay premium, of at least £2.52 per hour.   Asda has said however that the proposal ""retains the number of hours available"" for staff to work in each store. Alongside this news, Asda has also announced that it will shut seven in-store pharmacies, which employ 14 pharmacists and 48 other workers. It will also make a 22% cut to staff hours across all 23 in-store Post Office shops, and a reduction in opening hours for four sites. This would affect 23 salaried Post Office Managers and 200 hourly-paid staff. The supermarket said this decision was made due to a decline in the number of customers using this service. Ken Towle, retail director at Asda said: “The retail sector is evolving at pace and it is vital we review changing customer preferences, along with our own ways of working, to ensure we are operating as efficiently as possible, so that we can continue to invest and grow our business. ""We are now entering a period of consultation with our colleagues on these proposals. We recognise this will be a difficult time for them and will do all we can to support them through this process.”  Earlier this month, the supermarket had to defend itself over the wages it gives its staff after the GMB Union criticised it for falling even further behind its competitors on wages after Sainsbury's announced a pay boost.  The union said that Asda workers receive just £10.10 per hour, which was the lowest paid of the big four and one of the ""lowest paying retailers overall"".  However, Asda said during the last year it had provided two separate increases worth a total of 8% for hourly paid staff. Responding to the criticism, an Asda spokesperson said: ""We have increased retail colleague pay twice during the last 12 months and will confirm our new pay rates for 2023 to colleagues during Q1, following the outcome of negotiations with Usdaw where we have a pay bargaining agreement.""

Asda is shaking up its loyalty app - but the change is good news for shoppers,"More than three million people regularly use the Asda rewards app, and over £20million worth of rewards vouchers were spent at the supermarket in December last yearAsda is giving shoppers more time to spend vouchers through its Rewards app.  The big four supermarket is extending the period that customers have to spend a voucher after creating it in the app from one to three months.  The new change will allow shoppers more time to build up their Cashpots to spend for a special occasion.  All three million customers who use the supermarket's reward programme will be able to benefit from the extension.  Asda has also issued a reminder to customers that any unused cash in their Cashpots that has not yet been converted into vouchers will expire six months after the cash was earned.    This means that anyone who began using Asda Rewards last July needs to convert the money they earned in that month to vouchers before the end of January or they will lose them. Asda has said that customers will receive notifications in the app to remind them of the amount which is due to expire each month.  The Asda Rewards is an app-based loyalty scheme and prides itself on ""pounds, not points"" and it's vouchers can be created with as little as £1, and with the maximum voucher amount at £100.  Customers will see their Cashpot build up in the Asda Rewards app as they shop, the app can then be scanned upon checking out and can be linked up to an ASDA.com account for those shopping online. After this people can redeem their cash whenever they choose by creating a voucher in the app with the money they have saved. If you have the rewards app, you can earn extra in your Cashpot by buying ""Star Products"" or by completing in-app missions that are themed by product types.  A lot of Rewards customers used their vouchers to help with the cost of Christmas as Asda says around £20million worth of Asda Rewards vouchers were spent in store during December.

Thousands of households to get £35 water bill discount - see if you're due a payment,"Welsh Water has confirmed customers who suffered outages as a result of burst pipes in the run up to Christmas will receive money off their water bill as compensation. Thousands of households are set for a £35 bill discount after they were left without water. The incident happened in the run up to Christmas and was caused by burst pipes. Some 4,000 homes in Ceredigion, Wales, were affected in December.  Welsh Water has now confirmed customers who experienced outages will receive money off their water bill as compensation.   If your supply was cut off for more than 12 hours, you will be paid £35.  Some families were left without water for several days. Welsh Water has said additional £35 payments will be made for every subsequent 12-hour period.   If you’re entitled to a payment, the money will be paid automatically to your water account - you don’t need to apply for it. A spokesperson from Welsh Water said: ""Such disruption and inconvenience is rare, and our teams worked tirelessly to restore supplies as quickly as possible."" They added: ""We again would like to say how sorry we are for the inconvenience that was caused and hope our goodwill payments reflects this to our customers.""  More households are set to see their water cost reduced this year after the regulator Ofwat ordered 11 firms to cut bills.  The suppliers have been ordered to knock a collective £150million off water bills due to ""falling short"" of its expectations.  Ofwat said these firms had missed its targets on things like pollution, sewer flooding and water supply breakdowns.  Water firms that missed Ofwat's targets, like Southern Water and Thames Water, will have to return money to customers.  The exact refund per household will vary. But other water firms have the green light to increase bills - such as United Utilities, Wessex Water and South Staffs Water.  The average UK home pays £419 for water over 12 months, with the typical bill rising £4 this year.    Around 1.1million people need help paying these bills, according to trade body Water UK.  This will rise to at least 1.4million by 2025. Ofwat chief executive David Black said: ""We expect companies to improve their performance every year. Where they fail to do so, we will hold them to account."" He added: ""All water companies need to earn back the trust of customers and the public and we will continue to challenge the sector to improve.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/thousands-households-35-water-bill-29056068
Warning as millions of broadband customers face huge price hikes or £200 exit fees,"Which? has slammed telecoms firms such as BT, EE, Plusnet, TalkTalk and Vodafone for hiking their broadband prices mid-contract, urging them to ""step up and play their part to support their customers""Broadband customers are trapped between choosing huge mid-contract price hikes or exit fees of over £200, according to Which? consumer champions. Which? is now urging telecoms firms to let their customers leave their contacts without penalty if prices are hiked mid-contract. They have slammed the price increases as ""hugely concerning"" and ""difficult to justify"" given the cost of living crisis and rising bills for many households across the UK. In a huge blow to customers, many this year face their mid-contract prices increasing by more than 14%.  This comes after customers saw their broadband bills climb by nearly 10% last year, and as the cost of living crisis continues to push up prices of other bills.   Mobile and broadband customers usually their mid-contract hikes around April, which fall in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) plus an additional 3% to 3.9%. It means customers of firms such as BT, EE, Plusnet, Shell Energy Broadband, TalkTalk and Vodafone, may end up paying more than what they originally signed up for. This is because they do not know how much the prices can rise when they first sign up. Which?'s latest broadband survey shows that BT Group - which includes BT, EE and Plusnet - has already announced that they will go ahead with price rises of 14.4% for the vast majority of their customers. Meanwhile, the average EE customer would see the largest potential annual increase of £66.89.  This is closely followed by BT customers who could pay an extra £65.59 a year. And Vodafone, TalkTalk and Plusnet customers could pay an extra £54.86, £54.22 and £52.67 a year respectively.  While Shell Energy Broadband customers could see the lowest increase of this group, customers will still have to cash out an eye-watering £49.51 more.  Despite Ofcom rules stating that telecoms providers must offer their customers the right to exit their contract penalty free - if they are subject to unexpected price rises which are not stated in their contract - the rules do require the relevant terms to be set out prominently and transparently, at the point of sale.  Therefore, if the mid-contract price rises are written into the terms and conditions, Ofcom’s rule is that in those cases the customer does not have the right to exit penalty free. However, the regulator's terms do not specify that the terms be set out transparently during the sale, which is something that the regulator is currently investigating.  Regardless, Which? is calling on all providers to carefully assess what level of price increase can be justified given the current economic climate, and to allow customers to leave their contract without penalty. The informed consumer choice brand calculated the exit fee the average customer with 12 months remaining on their contract would face if they left early. They found that BT customers face the highest exit fees of £219.04. This is followed by Shell Energy Broadband, EE and Plusnet customers, who would pay £160.20, £150.49 and £144.75 respectively. Vodafone would pay an exit fee of £123.72.  And TalkTalk customers would pay the lowest exit fees of £122.40. While Sky and Virgin Media have not announced this year's approach to price increases, they traditionally allow their customers to haggle or switch when notified of such hikes.  Speaking about the price hikes, Rocio Concha, Which? Director of Policy and Advocacy, said: “It’s hugely concerning that many broadband customers could find themselves trapped in a lose-lose situation where they either have to accept exorbitant - and difficult to justify - mid-contract price hikes this Spring or pay costly exit fees to leave their contract early and find a better deal. ""Which? is calling on providers to let their customers leave without penalty if they face mid-contract price hikes. Providers should also carefully consider the level of any price rises when many consumers are already under huge financial pressure. ""With many households struggling to make ends meet, it is completely unfair that people are trapped in this situation. Telecoms providers need to step up and play their part to support their customers through the cost of living crisis.""  Exit fees for each provider   BT: £219.04 EE Broadband: £150.49 Plusnet: £144.75 Shell Energy Broadband: £160.20 TalkTalk: £122.40 Vodafone: £123.72  A spokesperson for BT Group said: “With the December 2022 CPI rate now announced, we can confirm our price change will be going ahead on 31st March.  ""We expect the average customer will see their price rise around £1 per week. This price rise doesn’t apply to all our customers.  ""Over 3 million customers across our BT Home Essentials, EE Mobile Basics, PAYG, BT Basic, landline-only and Home Phone Saver will have their prices frozen through 2023.  ""Although telecoms bills remain a small fraction of total average household spend, we know that everything adds up.  ""We take seriously our responsibility to ensure our services are accessible to the widest group of customers possible through our market leading social tariffs.""Customers who are struggling financially and are eligible for Home Essentials can move penalty free at any point in their contract, this also includes EE and Plusnet customers.""We are balancing our own rising costs due to high inflation and making vital digital infrastructure investments for the UK."" A spokesperson for Shell Energy Broadband said: ""Our terms allow for a price increase no higher than CPI + 3%. As ever, our customers will be the first to hear about any change in prices.  ""We recognise the budget pressures our customers are experiencing, and we will do all we can to help customers who are struggling to pay.  ""We have a £20m Helpfund to support the most vulnerable, and we will assist with payment plans or moving customers to a cheaper tariff whenever possible."" A TalkTalk spokesperson added: “This regulated CPI-linked price rise is preventable.  ""There is still time for Ofcom to act and reduce the wholesale price increases that lead to these price rises.  ""These are exceptional circumstances, and families and businesses across the UK need the regulator to act.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/warning-millions-broadband-customers-facing-29048085
Sainsbury's is opening its first overnight drive-through - and is giving away free food,"Sainbury's will be giving away free food from its new healthy food range to overnight shift workers at its new drive-through store in London but only for the next three daysSainsbury's is opening its first overnight drive-through where it will be giving away free food - but there's a catch. The site, which is called The Flourish Fuelling Station, is only open for three nights on Wednesday 25, Thursday 26, and Friday 27 from 5pm to 8am as the supermarket is now only testing the idea. The supermarket says if successful, it may explore providing further solutions to offer hot food options during unsociable hours in the future. The drive-thru is based the Sainsbury’s Petrol Station, London Colney, St Albans AL2 1AB. Sainsbury's says it is looking for a way to help overnight shift workers have access to ""hot and healthy"" meals.   The new overnight drive-through, which is also accessible for walk-ups, will be providing the free food from the supermarket's new Flourish range. The complete range features over 65 products which include both hot and cold food, with prices ranging from £1 to £4 normally.  The new food options will be available to buy across all Sainsbury's stores from today.  The whole new range includes dishes such as:  Hot  Sainsbury’s Flourish Jerk Chicken with Coconut Rice  Sainsbury’s Flourish Mexican Style Beef Chilli  Sainsbury’s Flourish Salmon with New Potatoes & Veg Medley  Sainsbury’s Flourish Italian Style Roasted Vegetable Pot (V) Sainsbury’s Flourish Roast Butternut Squash Risotto (V)   Cold  Sainsbury’s Flourish Vegan Bhaji & Rainbow Slaw Salad (Ve) Sainsbury’s Flourish Veggie Garden Frittata (V)   Snacks  Sainsbury’s Flourish Chickpea & Black Pepper Crackers (V) Sainsbury’s Flourish Beetroot Houmous (Vegan) Sainsbury’s Flourish Gut Health Yogurt (V)  Drinks  Sainsbury’s Flourish Energise Infusion Tea (Vegan) Sainsbury’s Flourish Calm Infusion Tea (Vegan) Sainsbury’s Flourish Energy Smoothie(Vegan) Sainsbury’s Flourish Mind Smoothie(Vegan)   Sainsbury's says the reason behind the opening of the drive-through, was because its research had found that 79% of night shift workers said they had ""unhealthy eating patterns"" due to overnight working. The big four supermarket's research also found over a third of night shift workers with poor diets claim unhealthy food being easier to access is one of the main culprits for these eating habits.  As a result, they are relying on unhealthy snacks, caffeine and sugar during working hours. Claire Hughes, Sainsbury’s Director of Product and Innovation, said: “It is a shame that night shift workers don't have the same access to healthy, balanced meals as those working a regular nine to five, particularly as these eating habits are causing them to feel tired, whilst not keeping them full. “We hope that Sainsbury’s new Flourish range will help to address that and we hope it makes it easier not just for shift workers, but for everyone to find solutions for convenient healthy eating.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/sainsburys-opening-first-overnight-drive-29044938
First-time buyer schemes: All the help available if you're buying your first home,"Buying your first home has never been more complicated - but there are first-time buyer schemes out there to help you save up. We explain how they work and what you need to knowGetting on the property ladder can feel like an impossible task for many struggling savers. But if your dream is to own your first home, then make sure you take advantage of first-time buyer schemes. The road to buying your first home has become harder in recent months due to the cost of living crisis and soaring interest rates. This means you need to look carefully at your circumstances to assess whether a mortgage is right for you. This applies to both affording the monthly repayments and bills, as well as if you can reasonably afford to save up for a deposit right now. You can get a deposit from as little as 5% of the property value but these types of deals normally come with higher rates.   It’s best to save up for a bigger deposit if you can although for some people, that might not always be possible. Other costs to consider include the price of moving, such as mortgage fees, surveyors and possibly stamp duty. Here are the first-time buyer schemes that could help you on the ladder. Lifetime ISA With a Lifetime ISA (LISA) account, you can get a free 25% cash boost from the Government if you're saving for your first home or retirement. You can save up to £4,000 each tax year, meaning the maximum bonus you can pocket is £1,000. The maximum bonus is £33,000 if you open it at 18, and max it out until you turn 50 - you can’t pay into a LISA beyond the age of 50. If you're saving for your first home, the value of the property you're planning on buying cannot exceed £450,000. Anyone who is aged 18 to 39 can open a Lifetime ISA for free - and if you're in a couple, you can open one each. You'll pay a penalty and lose your bonus if you take money out of your LISA account for anything other than your first home or retirement. The penalty you'll pay is 25% on any money you have saved up, including your bonus.   Help to Buy ISA Help to Buy ISA accounts closed to new savers on November 30, 2019 - but if you’ve already opened an account, you can keep saving until November 30, 2029. You must also claim your bonus by December 1, 2030. When they first launched, you could open an account with a maximum of £1,200 but after that you're limited to saving £200 a month into it. The Government tops up your savings with a 25% bonus - the maximum you can get free is £3,000, and you'd need to save £12,000 to get this. Shared ownership This is where you buy a share of a property - between 25% and 75% of the property value - and pay rent on the rest. The share you can buy is usually between 25% and 75% but can be as low as 10% on some homes. You can buy additional amounts under what's known as “staircasing” which is where you slowly increase the amount of the property you own. Shared ownership isn’t limited to first-time buyers, but to be eligible, you need to have an individual income no greater than £80,000 a year or £90,000 a year in London. Your combined income can't be greater than these caps if you're buying as a couple.    Mortgage guarantee scheme   This is a scheme designed for first-time buyers and homeowners who have just a 5% deposit, with the Government acting as their guarantor. The idea is that the Government picks up some of the cost if the lender loses money, for example, if the property is repossessed. The guarantee from the Government will apply down to 80% of the purchase value of the property - so with a 95% mortgage, the remaining 15%.  But experts including Martin Lewis ' MoneySavingExpert website have warned that 5% deposit deals are typically more expensive - so keep in mind you'll get a better mortgage rate with a larger deposit.  If you do use this scheme, the property must be worth no more than £600,000.  It will run until the end of December 2023, having been launched in April 2021 after almost all 5% mortgage deals were pulled from the market due Covid.  You can find 5% deposit deals outside of this scheme. First Homes scheme The First Homes scheme allows first-time buyers to get a discount of between 30% and 50% on the value of a new-build property. The homes cannot cost more than £420,000 in London, or £250,000 anywhere else in England, after the discount has been applied. Councils can impose lower price caps. The scheme can be used to purchase a home from someone else who originally bought it as part of the scheme To qualify for the scheme, you'll need to have had a household income of £80,000 or less, or £90,000 or less in Greater London. You also need to take out a mortgage of at least 50% of the purchase price of the property. There is a fee involved, which is set by the developer, but you get this back if your application is unsuccessful. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/first-time-buyer-schemes-help-29046835
Energy suppliers giving out free bill credit worth up to £250 - see if you're eligible,"Five energy suppliers, including British Gas, Ovo and Shell Energy after giving out free bill credit worth up to £250 to their customers to help with rising costs this winterFive energy suppliers are giving out free bill credit worth up to £250 to help with the cost of living crisis. Millions of households are eligible for hundreds of pounds of free credit from their energy supplier this winter, as several companies are offering extra support. With the cost of living crisis, rising bills and the blackouts at the forefront of a lot of families minds, the extra support will come as a huge help. Energy companies such as British Gas and Ovo are providing help to hard-up households.  It is worth noting that many of these companies are identifying which customers are eligible for the help themselves.   We have rounded up the companies that are offering free credit to customers, and an explanation on how you can claim it. If you are unsure whether your supplier is contributing, you can get in touch with them to see what help they can offer you. British Gas - £250 Thousands of British Gas customers who are on a prepayment meter could be eligible for up to £250 in free credit.  British Gas says it is identifying anyone who is eligible - which means you don't need to contact the company. For those that are, the credit will be added to the prepayment meters over the next month, the supplier has confirmed.  News of the free bill credit comes as part of British Gas' new £10million package for vulnerable prepayment customers.  Shell Energy - £150 Shell Energy is giving some customers an extra £150 bill credit through a one-off boost of the Warm Home Discount scheme. The Warm Home Discount is normally worth £150 meaning all 157,000 customers who get the help will receive £300 in total. The money will be applied to your energy account. Customers will also get a top-up if they have received certain benefits and joined Shell Energy on or before August 21 this year. See who is eligible for the Warm Home Discount here. EDF - £100 EDF is offering eligible customers who have signed an electric car leasing contract with them £100 in free credit. Customers need to be aware that in order to get this credit, they must request the offer using an online claim form. It must be filled out no later than three months from signing the personal hire contact. Those that get their energy from EDF can then get the £100, including credit to the customer’s electricity bill after delivery of the car to the their property.  Utilita - £150 Utilita is giving some customers £150 to help with rising costs.  This is again supplied through the Warm Home Discount scheme.  Utilita has split the discount into two payments of £75, with the first payout for pay-as-you go customers having been made between December 16 and 31, 2022. The second is being issued by the end of January, the supplier has confirmed to The Sun. Meanwhile, households that pay for their energy using traditional prepayment meters will be emailed the £75 vouchers this week. If you pay by direct debit, Utilita will apply the full £150 onto your accounts by the end of January. Ovo - up to £15 Ovo has increased its temporary credit from £5 to £15. This is to allow more breathing space when you run out of energy and can't get to a shop to top-up.  Ovo says that, so far, over £300,000 of temporary credit has been issued each week since the scheme started in October. It comes as part of a £50million support package.

One week passport warning before millions face paying more - see how it affects you,"The same fees for a passport apply regardless of whether you're applying for your first passport, for a renewal or to replace a lost, stolen or damaged passportHolidaymakers have just one week left to renew their passports before application fees to renew rise by around 9%. From next Thursday, February 2, the cost to replace your expired passport through a form online increases to £82.50.  This is £7 more than the current cost of £75.50.  For children's passports, the price will also increase from the current £49 to £53.50, which is an increase of £4.50. To get a new passport through the standard paper form which can be collected at the Post Office, the price will increase by nearly £10 going from £85 now to £83 next week.  For children, it will rise to £64 from £58.50.    For fast-track passports, which allow you to get your new passport in a week, is rising to £155 for adults and £126 for children.  This is £13 and £4 up respectively from the current price of £142 and £122.  For those who need the quickest turnaround, the premium passport services, which get you a new passport within the same day, are going up by nearly £20 to £193.50.  The same fees apply regardless of whether you're applying for your first passport, renewal or to replace a lost, stolen or damaged passport. These increases, according to the Passport Office, will “help enable the government to continue improving its services”.  The Home Office, which runs the Passport office, also says the fees will help it move towards a system which meets its costs and reduces its reliance on funding from general taxation.  It also added : ""The Government does not make any profit from the cost of passport applications."" The Passport Office has not changed its advice on processing times in response to the change in prices however there is a risk that a surge in applications to beat the price rise will put more pressure on the system.  The turnaround time to renew the old burgundy EU passport used to be just two to three weeks in 2019.  Now, however, you need to allow up to 10 weeks for the turnaround according to an investigation published by the National Audit Office (NAO) in December last year.  The 10-week period is the current target for the Passport office, so you should be aware that it could also take longer so if your passport is expiring in the next three months, the earlier you apply the better.

Major energy supplier launches lowest price heat pump installation offer,"Scottish Gas, which is British Gas' Scottish division, will start its heat pump installation price at £499 but are willing to go lower if you show them a cheaper offer by an MCS-credited installerA major energy supplier has said it will guarantee the ""lowest"" price to install a heat pump. Scottish Gas, which is British Gas' Scottish division, will start its heat pump installation price at £499 but are willing to go lower if you show them a cheaper offer by an MCS-credited installer. The same offer is being given to households in England and Wales, however, the starting installation price is £2,999.  Again British Gas is willing to match the cost of another installer.  The reason why Scottish Gas offer is a lot lower is due to a £7,500 grant provided by the Scottish Government through its Home Energy Scotland scheme.   The offer for all customers applies to a standard air source heat pump up to 7Kw and a standard cylinder with a capacity of up to 200L, along with mechanical and electrical installation. The energy firm will also offer five years warranty after the installation as part of the offer.  Scottish customers, who are managed by Scottish Gas, will also be supported by the new Heat Pump Heroes team which is a new heat pump advisory service by the energy firm.  The service aims to provide further guidance to those installing heat pumps.  British Gas hopes the offers will help more people make the switch to heat pumps and lower their emissions.  Overall, the energy firm has so far installed over 2,300 heat pumps  Andrew Middleton, managing director of British and Scottish Gas Net Zero said: ""Heat pumps are an essential part of the UK’s journey towards a decarbonised future.  ""We recognise that many households are being cautious with their spending in the current climate and want to do all we can to make this technology more affordable - so that those customers who can make the move to low carbon heating feel compelled to do so now."" The energy firm explained that heat pump technology is ""widely recognised"" as the ""best immediate option"" for off-grid and well-insulated homes.  It also said the installation of heat pumps was ""critical"" to keep the UK ""on track"" to achieve its Net Zero target by 2050. Business and energy minister Lord Callanan said: “We know that heat pumps are proven to be an excellent, reliable technology which help consumers to move away from fluctuating gas prices. “With offers like this one, alongside government incentives such as slashing VAT on heat pump installation to zero, government and industry can work together in helping more homeowners to see these benefits in 2023 and beyond”.

State pension age increase - five key questions answered as millions set to work longer,"A further increase to 68-year-old was not due to happen until 2046 - however, a review released in 2017 called for this to be brought forward and now the state pension age could be set to rise even further The state pension age could be set to rise to 68 by the end of the 2030s in a move that would mean millions of Brits have to work longer.   Your retirement age is the earliest age you can start claiming your state pension from the Government.   This is separate from any private or workplace pension you may have.  The current state pension age for women and men retiring now is 66, but it will rise to 67 between 2026 and 2028. A further increase to 68 was not due to happen until 2046 - however, a review released in 2017 called for this to be brought forward.  The review argued the state pension age should hit 68 between 2037 and 2039 due to people living longer. A Government source was quoted as saying: “There is a real risk that more people will die before they reach retirement and can draw their pensions, given the change in life expectancy projections since 2017 if we were to bring the state pension age increase too far forward. ""That would be especially true of people in the most deprived areas of the country where life expectancy is already lower.”  Here, the Daily Mirror's Head of Business Graham Hiscott answers five key questions.  What is the state pension age?  The earliest age you can start receiving your state pension may be different to the age you can get a workplace or personal pension. It was 65 but is now 66 and gradually increasing. It also now depends on when you were born. What are the current plans?  The state pension age for men and women will reach 67 by 2028. As things stand, a scheduled rise to 68 is not due until 2046. Can I boost my state pension? There are two main ways: by deferring it or buying extra years.  What’s the point of deferring?  You don’t automatically get the state pension at your retirement age – you have to claim it. By putting off claiming, or deferring, your pension you get bigger payments later on.  This is mainly useful if you are planning to work beyond your retirement age. But be sure to do the sums on just how much money you will be giving up in the short-term.  And what about buying extra years? If for whatever reason you missed out on paying national insurance you can replace missing years by topping up with any spare cash you might be lucky enough to have. Buying extra years involves paying what are known as voluntary class 3 national insurance contributions. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/household-bills/state-pension-age-increase-five-29042580
Asda makes major change to popular items as supermarket axes 'use by' labels,"Asda said the packaging change would allow customers to use their own judgement to when the product is ""off"" which will help combat food wasteAsda announced a major change for over half of its popular own brand products this month. The big four supermarket said it was to remove the ""use by"" dates across a range of its own brand yoghurts and will replace them with ""Best Before"" dates instead.  ""Best before"" dates are about the quality of food, while ""use by"" dates are used to show when a product is no longer safe to eat. Asda said the packaging change would allow customers to use their own judgement to when the product is ""off"" which will help combat food waste.  The change will gradually happen over the next few weeks with customers able to see it on around 28 of its products.   This includes Asda's natural yoghurt, Greek yoghurt and Extra Special strawberry and hazelnut yoghurt. Asda said the decision to change the packaging's wording comes after data from climate action group NGO Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap) revealed that a massive 50% of all yoghurt wasted from UK households comes from unopened cartons. The labelling itself has also been cited as the reason for the waste, as an additional 70% of yoghurt waste comes from households not 'eating the product in time'. The popular supermarket chain said it has conducted ""robust food safety and quality evaluations"" on all of the products it will make packaging changes too.  Asda says the 28 dairy products that have been targeted sell around 455,000 units a week.  Paul Gillow, vice president of fresh and frozen foods at Asda, said: “We are always looking at ways we can help customers reduce food waste in the home, and with research from WRAP saying 54,000 tonnes of edible yoghurt is thrown away unnecessarily each year we are hopeful this change will both make a big difference to the environment and save customers money at the same time.”  The packaging change to its yogurt products follows Asda's previous decision to remove the ""Best Before"" dates on around 250 of its fresh fruit and vegetable items in last year.  The ""Best By"" date was replaced with a new code that would be used by store staff to ""ensure quality and freshness"".  Again the decision was made to aid the prevention of food waste.  Over the last few years, several major supermarkets have done this with Tesco being one of the first back in 2018 to scrap the ""Best Before"" date on around 100 of its products.  Co-op scrapped the dates for its own brand yoghurts in April last year and in January, Morrisons announced its plans to remove ""Use By"" dates on milk and encourages customers to use a ""sniff test"" instead.  The charity WRAP has frequently condemned the idea of “Best Before” dates on fruit and vegetables arguing that they only contribute to the climate crisis by encouraging perfectly good food to be thrown away.  Catherine David, director of collaboration and change at WRAP, said: “WRAP is thrilled to see our partner Asda make these changes on yoghurts – which will help reduce food waste in our homes.  ""Wasting food feeds climate change and costs us money – with the average family spending £700 a year on good food which ends up in the bin.  ""Our research shows applying the appropriate date label to products like yoghurts can help reduce the amount of good food that is thrown in the bin.""

Best UK savings accounts - and how to BEAT these rates through your bank,"The top savings rate for easy-access accounts currently sits at 2.9% with rates having climbed again over the last few weeks - but you might be able to do better through your bankSavings rates have been slowly creeping up over the last year - so are you getting the most out of your money? The cost of living crisis means it is more important than ever to check where your cash is sitting. Interest rates on savings accounts have been rising thanks to nine consecutive base rate hikes by the Bank of England.  The Bank has just hiked its base rate to 3.5% with potentially more rises on the cards.  But while savings rates are on the up, they are still painfully behind the rate of inflation. Inflation has just dipped slightly to 10.5% but remains close to a 40-year high. The top savings rate for easy-access accounts currently sits at 2.9%.    You can also get up to 4.56% fixed - but this is down compared to October 2022 when the best-paying fixed deals paid over 5%. Experts suggest many longer savings products have already factored in future interest rate rises. When picking a savings account, make sure you are covered by the Financial Service Compensation Scheme (FSCS) which protects up to £85,000 of your money if a provider goes bust. There is an allowance you can earn in interest each year year tax-free.  The personal savings allowance is £1,000 for basic-rate taxpayers and £500 for higher-rate taxpayers. This doesn’t include interest earned in ISA accounts, as these are tax-free savings products.  You can put away £20,000 each year into ISAs. Savers should be warned that rates are changing rapidly - but here are the top rates at the time of writing.   Best easy-access savings accounts  Easy-access savings accounts allow you to withdraw your money when you want - although some providers do limit how many withdrawals you can make per year. This is good for those who may need to dip into their savings - although the rates aren’t as good as fixed accounts. The top-paying standard easy-access account at the time of writing are:  Yorkshire Building Society - 3.35% (between £1 and £5,000) or 2.85% (between £5,001 and £500,000) Shawbrook Bank - 2.92% (between £1,000 to £85,000 or £170,000 joint account) Cynergy Bank - 2.9% (includes fixed 0.15% bonus for first 12 months - deposit between £1 and £1million)  However, there are ways to get a better rate - depending on who you bank with and how much you want to save. Barclays' Rainy Day Saver offers a rate of 5.12% but you need to be a member of its Blue Rewards. You can also only deposit up to £5,000. Blue Rewards costs £5 each month but it does pay £5 cashback if pay out two or more direct debits. The Nationwide FlexDirect current account pays 5% interest fixed for one year for new customers - but only on up to £1,500. The Santander Edge Saver for existing Santander Edge customers pays 4% on up to £4,000 of your savings. This includes a 0.5% bonus for the first 12 months. Santander Edge isn't a free account, you pay £3 a month to use it. Or if you have a HSBC current account, you can get 3% interest on up to £10,000 on the months where you don’t withdraw any money. For months where you do withdraw money, the rate drops to 0.65%. Chip also offers a 3% bonus on your money - not technically interest - but this isn't protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.   Best notice savings accounts  Like the name suggests, these accounts require you to give notice when you want to withdraw your money. The top-paying notice accounts right now are:  Hinckley & Rugby Building Society - 3.6% (120 days notice - deposit between £2,500 and £300,000) OakNorth Bank - 3.35% (120 days notice - deposit between £1 and £500,000) or 3.2% (90 days notice - deposit between £1 and £500,000)   Best fixed-rate savings accounts  Fixed-rate accounts don't normally allow you to withdraw your money until the end of the term - not ideal for households who may need to access their funds. You do get a return compared to easy-access accounts, but as rates are expected to keep rising, it might be a good idea not to fix for too long. The top-paying fixed accounts right now are:  Zenith Bank via Raisin - 3.5% (six months fixed - deposit between £1,000 and £85,000) Atom Bank - 3.75% (nine months fixed - deposit between £50 and £100,000) Habib Bank Zurich - 4.33% (one year fixed - deposit between £5,000 and £1million) Atom Bank - 4.45% (two year fixed - deposit between £50 and £100,000 SmartSave - 4.56% (three year fixed - deposit between £10,000 and £85,000) Isbank via Raisin - 4.5% (five year fixed - deposit between £1,000 and £85,000)   Best ISA savings rates  ISA stands for Individual Savings Account. Each year, you can deposit £20,000 into an ISA and you don't pay tax on the interest. The rates on these savings products have been improving in recent years, although you can still get better rates elsewhere.

Major bank issues urgent warning over scam that could cost you £700,"Fraudsters are creating fake ads for loans and jobs before disappearing with people's money in a surge of advance fee scam cases, with hard-up households most at riskLloyds Banking Group has issued an urgent warning over the number of ""advance fee"" scams that have surged over the last year. Advance fee scams happen when a victim is asked to pay an upfront fee for goods or services that don’t materialise. Creating fake ads for loans, jobs and rental properties are among the most common tactics currently being used by crooks. Cases of this type of fraud more than doubled in the past year, with victims typically losing around £200. People can also be targeted by fraudsters when trying to secure a rental property or even a new job.  Victims lose an average £711 which is lower than the previous 12 months, recorded at £1,194.   Cases have jumped by 82% over the last year and continuing to increase, according to the latest figures. It suggests fraudsters might be chasing a higher number of lower value scams in the current economic environment. Liz Ziegler, fraud prevention director at Lloyds Bank, said: ""Fraudsters will ruthlessly adapt to any changes in consumer behaviour. ""With the increased cost of living putting more pressure on people’s finances, the recent surge in advance fee scams targeting those on low incomes or with a poor credit history is alarming."" Who is being targeted? London saw the highest number of cases of advance fee scams in the UK last year. But the West Midlands was a particular hotspot as, relative to population size, the number of cases reported was around 20 per cent higher than the national average. Worryingly, new analysis also shows that those living in more deprived areas of the country are twice as likely to fall victim as those in less deprived areas, accounting for over 70 per cent of all advance fee scam cases. Those aged between 25 and 34 are most likely to fall victim, followed by 35 to 44 year olds. Collectively those two age groups make up around half, or 49 per cent, of all victims.  Fast loan scams Loan fee scams are also a particular concern at the moment, as fraudsters will often target people on low incomes or with a poor credit history. Reports of loan fee scams have more than doubled over the last 12 months, up by 105 per cent compared to the previous year. Case numbers continue to rise sharply, with the average amount lost by victims last year recorded at £214. Victims will typically reply to an online advert for a fast loan from a company they have never heard of, or sometimes the fraudster will pose as a genuine firm. Their application will be approved regardless of their credit history and they are told to pay an upfront fee by bank transfer before they receive the loan. Once this fee is paid, the fraudster might even ask for further payments.  Eventually, the victim does not hear from the company again and the loan is never received. Some common reasons the scammers give to explain why the advanced payment needs to be paid include:  Payment release fee Insurance fee Verification fee Loan company fee Processing fee Guarantor fee Tax payment  Ms Ziegler added: ""The important thing to remember is that a genuine lender will always conduct thorough credit checks prior to agreeing a loan and won’t ask for an upfront payment before releasing the funds. ""If you’re concerned in any way about your finances there are lots of reputable organisations that can help, and it always makes sense to speak to your bank first. ""The abundance of these fake online ads reinforces the importance of the government’s Online Safety Bill to ensure social media sites and search engines stamp out fraudsters operating on their platforms.""  How to stay safe from loan fee scams  Do your research to ensure you’re dealing with a real company Avoid any company that says they can guarantee you a loan regardless of your credit status. A reputable lender will always conduct a thorough credit check. You shouldn’t be asked to pay an upfront fee for a loan from a genuine company. If you are, it’s likely a scam. If you’re worried about your financial situation, speak to your bank first. They should be able to help, or point you towards a reputable organisation that can.

"Martin Lewis explains how to get free £1,000 every year with one type of savings account","You get a 25% bonus on your savings when you put your money into a Lifetime ISA (LISA) account - but the money has to be spent on your first home or retirement, or you'll pay a penaltyMartin Lewis has explained how to get up to £1,000 free each year from the Government by using a specific savings account.   You get a 25% bonus on your savings when you put your money into a Lifetime ISA (LISA) account.  The maximum amount you can put into a LISA is £4,000 each tax year - meaning a yearly bonus of up to £1,000. If you save less than this, you'll still get the 25% bonus on what you've saved - for example, save £2,000 and you'll get £500 free. But the catch is, you need to use any money put into a LISA on either your first property or your retirement. If you withdraw the cash for any other reason, you’ll pay a penalty of 25%.   You can open a LISA if you’re aged between 18 to 39 although you can keep saving into an existing account until your 50th birthday. The maximum bonus you can pocket from the Government is £33,000 if you open your LISA at the age of 18, and max it out until you hit 50. This is unless you're born on April 6, in which case the biggest bonus is £32,000.  “The state will give you a 25% boost on the money you put in,"" explained Martin during his Martin Lewis Money Show Live on ITV this evening.  “You can put in up to £4,000 a year so that’s up to £1,000 a year bonus from the state.”  But the MoneySavingExpert issued a few words of warning about these savings accounts. If you’re opening a LISA with the intention of saving for your first home, you’ll need to have the account for at least one year before you get any bonus. You also need to keep in mind that the total property value you can buy with the help of a LISA must not exceed £450,000. “Do be careful if you think the house you could buy could be above a £450,000 maximum LISA house,” urged Martin.  The MoneySavingExpert team this week wrote to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to call on the LISA penalty to be removed, or the property value threshold to be increased.  “The LISA £450,000 [limit] hasn’t gone up since 2017. They should either wipe the penalty for people buying bigger [homes] or put that £450,000 up,"" he said. “Not the subject for today but I hope to hear back from the Chancellor on that because I don’t think it’s that fair.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/martin-lewis-explains-how-free-29041952
Striking Amazon staff say robots in warehouses are 'treated better' than employees,"Amazon staff walked out for the first time today. The row was triggered by last year’s 50p an hour pay rise from the US firm, whose stock market value is almost £800billionAmazon staff on strike over pay claim robots in its warehouses “are treated better than us”.  Darren Westwood and Garfield Hilton were among 300 employees who staged the online giant’s first walkout in the UK today.   The row was triggered by last year’s 50p an hour pay rise from the US firm, whose stock market value is almost £800billion.  Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, one of the world’s richest people, is worth almost £100bn. Staff at the Coventry site want their minimum wage of around £10.50 a hour to be upped to £15. Workers, who scan stock that is sent out to Amazon fulfilment centres to be shipped to consumers, claim they are constantly monitored.    Mr Westwood, 57, said he had a black mark put on his records for being a minute late when logging back on after a 30-minute break.  He told the Mirror: “If we have an injury, it is treated as our own fault. “If the robots break down, they have a team of engineers who fix them.”  Mr Hilton said he had seen fellow workers falling asleep on the short bus ride to Amazon’s warehouse.    He told the BBC: “There’s a huge amount of them in the building virtually in ghost mode.”  Stuart Richards, senior organiser with the GMB union, and Amazon worker Nazaret Zemuy also joined the picket line.  Amazon countered the staff claims, saying its system “recognises great performance”.  The company also said it “encourages coaching to help employees improve if they are not meeting their performance goals”. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/striking-amazon-staff-say-robots-29050943
Millions 'set to work longer under plans to fast forward state pension age rise to 68',"The current state pension age for women and men retiring now is 66, but it will rise to 67 between 2026 and 2028 but this is steadily increasing over the next few yearsThe state pension age could be set to rise to 68 by the end of the 2030s in a move that would mean millions of Brits have to work longer.  Your retirement age is the earliest age you can start claiming your state pension from the Government.  This is separate from any private or workplace pension you may have. The current state pension age for women and men retiring now is 66, but it will rise to 67 between 2026 and 2028. A further increase to 68 was not due to happen until 2046 - however, a review released in 2017 called for this to be brought forward. The review argued the state pension age should hit 68 between 2037 and 2039 due to people living longer.  But The Sun reports that this change could be brought forward sooner, to as early as 2035.    This would affect the retirement plans of those who are aged 54 and under today.  The newspaper claims the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt could announce the move as early as the spring Budget, which will take place on March 15.  The next review into the raising the state pension age had already been due this year by May 7, 2023. A Government source was quoted as saying: “There is a real risk that more people will die before they reach retirement and can draw their pensions, given the change in life expectancy projections since 2017 if we were to bring the state pension age increase too far forward. ""That would be especially true of people in the most deprived areas of the country where life expectancy is already lower.” Before any future changes could become law, Parliament would need to approve the plans.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pension (DWP) told The Mirror: “No decision has been taken on changes to the state pension age.  “The Government is required by law to regularly review the State Pension age and the second State Pension Age Review is currently considering, based on a wide range of evidence including latest life expectancy data and two independent reports, whether the rules around State Pension age remain appropriate.“The review will be published early this year.” The Mirror has contacted the Treasury for comment. How do I check my state pension age?  You can check your state pension age online.   You can also look at your state pension forecast to find out how much money you’ll get.  The state pension is separate to any private or workplace pensions you may have.  How much is the state pension?  There are two different types of state pension - which one you claim depends on when you were born. You claim the new state pension if you’re:  a man born on or after 6 April 1951 a woman born on or after 6 April 1953  The amount you get depends on your National Insurance record. You need 35 qualifying years on your National Insurance record to get the full new State Pension, and ten years to get anything at all. The full new State Pension is worth £185.15 per week. This is rising to £203.85 from April 2023. You can claim the basic state pension if you’re:  a man born before 6 April 1951 a woman born before 6 April 1953  How much you get through the basic state pension also depends on your National Insurance record. You need 30 qualifying years on your National Insurance record to get the full amount. The minimum number of years is usually 11 for men born before 1945, and 10 years for women born before 1950. The full basic state pension is worth £141.85 per week. This is rising to £156.20 from April 2023. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/millions-set-work-longer-under-29034403
Six things you should avoid doing between 4.30pm and 6pm to be paid by your energy supplier,"Tonight's event will happen for 90 minutes between 4:30pm and 6pm and those taking part are encouraged by the National Grid to reduce the use of ""power hungry"" appliances during the windowHouseholds will be paid to cut their energy usage again tonight under a new scheme by the National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO). This will be the second time the Demand Flexibility Service (DFS) has been activated outside the trials last year. It has been triggered because the National Grid says supplies remain ""tighter than normal"".  The first scheme ran yesterday from 5pm to 6pm. To take part, you will need to have a smart meter which can send readings every 30 minutes and if you have signed up, you should've already received a notification telling you about the window.  Tonight's event will happen for 90 minutes between 4:30pm and 6pm and those taking part are encouraged by the National Grid ESO to reduce the use of ""power hungry"" appliances during the window.    On its website, the National Grid ESO says that small appliances such as modern televisions consume very little electricity, so it won't ""be worth"" adapting usage of these during an event. As you are paid for how much you reduce your energy consumption, you should avoid doing these activities during the 90-minute window this evening. The National Grid is expected to pay energy suppliers the equivalent of £3 per unit (kWh) saved.  Dry your clothes  It is common knowledge that your tumble dryer is one of the most ""power-hungry"" appliances in your home.  Data from Comparethemarket.com, which is based on Energy Price Guarantee, shows you use you use around 2.50kWh of energy per tumble dryer cycle.  Cook food Another thing you could avoid doing between 4.30pm and 6pm to save money is using your electric oven.  This doesn't mean not eating - but cooking your dinner either before or after this time frame. Comparethemarket.com reports that electric hobs use around 0.71kWh of energy per average use and an electric oven can use around 1.56kWh of energy.  Wash dishes If you have decided to have your food a little early. you may want to hold off doing your washing up and maybe let the dishes ""soak"" for the hour and a half window.  If you have a dishwasher, the average use of this appliance can run up to 1.56Wh per use and is usually one of the most expensive appliances you can run in your kitchen.  By choosing to do your dishes after 6pm you could help build up the amount you could be paid by your energy supplier.  Wash your clothes Again if you have the sudden urge to put a clothes wash on in the 90-minute window tonight, maybe hold off until a bit later.  The washing machine is again one of the most expensive appliances you can run in your home. According to the cleaning and laundry support group In the Wash, the average household washing machine uses 0.793 kWh of energy per cycle. The most efficient machines can use as little as 0.52 kWh per cycle, while the least efficient machines can use as much as 0.99 kWh per cycle.  So you could make yourself a decent saving if hold off giving your wardrobe a wash.  Have a shower/run a bath Again, you will need to avoid heating water during this window as these are the activities costing you, particularly if your water is heated by electricity and not through your boiler.  According to the Waterwise Project, the energy you use for a 40 degrees power shower that lasts for 10 minutes, would require 5.76 kWh of energy to heat. To fill a 100-litre bath, which is the average in the UK, requires 3.84kWh of energy to heat up to 40 degrees. The amount of energy you use will be lower if you do not have a power shower, shower for less or have a shorter bath, but those minor details will not have that big of an effect on the energy used. Charge your electric car This may be obvious to many, but charging your electric car can use a significant amount of energy, so by avoiding it in this window you could help yourself save a lot of energy and in turn extra cash. Electric vehicle battery sizes are measured in kWh as is the electricity that is delivered to your home. It takes around eight hours on average to full charge an electric car. So you could save a significant chunk of your energy by holding off charging your car until 6:01pm.  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/six-things-you-should-avoid-29034682
Drivers could save £800 on energy bills by selling power from their electric car,"Ovo Energy has created a scheme that could see Electric Vehicle users save £800 a year by selling power from their cars - but it relies on getting hard-to-find and expensive chargers fitted firstElectric vehicle (EV) drivers may be able to shave hundreds of pounds off their energy bills through a new trial.  The idea is that Brits will be able to charge their car using cheaper off-peak energy. They could then use this surplus energy to either power their home at peak times, or sell the power back to the National Grid. The big players involved in the new Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) trial are OVO Energy, Volkswagen UK and smart energy company Indra. Ovo ran a limited trial from 2020 until 2022, and some users managed to save up to £800 a year on energy bills.  The scheme is currently only open to Ovo customers who own Volkswagen electric cars. Drivers also need a special ""bi-directional"" charger - which effectively lets power flow two ways - to take part in the trial.   These can cost thousands of pounds - This is Money claims there are some selling online for just under £6,000. It isn't clear if households will have to pay for this charger themselves as part of the next Ovo Energy trial, which launched on January 21. If drivers have to fork out the cost of the charger themselves, then this could potentially mean it would take years to claw any money back. Ovo Energy said it ""won’t share final details"" at the moment about who will pay for the charger. Regardless, the scheme is being praised, with many - including ministers - saying that the UK needs a ""new network infrastructure"" in place for EVs.  Energy and Climate Minister Graham Stuart said: “We want to make smart charging an easier choice for drivers of EVs, whether that is charging on the driveway, at the workplace, or parked on the street.  ""To do that we need to build new network infrastructure at pace, using the latest available technologies.” Alex Thwaites, Head of Zero Carbon Living at OVO Energy, said: ""OVO has been leading the way in supporting customers to transition to electric vehicles and bring them on the journey to zero carbon living through exciting new products and offerings.  ""This is not just about driving renewable energy solutions forward, it’s about demonstrating how customers can actually reduce their energy bills by making the switch to an EV.  ""With OVO's V2G tariff trial we saw some EV drivers save up to £800 a year on their bills.” Scott Neuman, Chief Executive Officer at Kaluza, added: “V2X will have a transformative effect on decarbonising our energy system but only if we make it accessible and affordable for all.” The scheme is currently only open to Ovo customers who own Volkswagen electric cars, but the energy firm hopes to expand it to owners of other car firms in the future.

Special 'social tariff' to cut energy bills long-term for certain people being considered,"Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of regulator Ofgem, said a fall in wholesale energy prices over recent months was expected to feed through to millions of households over timeThe chief executive of Ofgem has backed calls for a social energy tariff - as he warned bills are unlikely to return to pre-pandemic levels. Jonathan Brearley said a fall in wholesale energy prices over recent months was expected to feed through to millions of households over time. But he said: “While we are some way from the more shocking predictions that we saw a few months ago, prices are unlikely to go back to the levels we saw pre-pandemic.” A Government price cap currently limits the average energy bill for millions of households to around £2,500 a year. That is set to jump to an average of £3,000 a year from April.    By then, energy bills are expecting to eat up 10% of the average household’s income, rising to almost 30% for those on the state pension.  Mr Brearley called that “truly extraordinary”, adding “the scale of the challenge for many people out there remains enormous.” The fall in wholesale prices is expected to result in average bills falling below the £3,000 a year cap by the summer. That would save the government a fortune in top-up payments. However, even with the drop, average bills are still forecast to be more than double what they were last winter. Mr Brearley also used a speak at the Institute for Government in London to back calls for a social tariff.  The idea, already suggested by campaign groups, would be to provide a subsidised rate for the vulnerable. It is unclear how it would work in practice, when it could be implemented, whether it would policed by Ofgem and if it would replace the existing price cap mechanism for more than 20 million households. Mr Brearley said alternatives to the current price cap should be “actively pursued.” He went on: “We think there is a case for examining, with urgency, a social tariff that limits the impact of extremely high prices and reduces volatility for a defined set of vulnerable groups. “To be clear, this tariff would need to be subsidised when prices are high.” Mr Brearley admitted that Ofgem had made mistakes in allowing the number of suppliers to balloon in a bid to inject competition.  But the move backfired with huge costs when the surge in wholesale prices, caused by Russia ’s war in Ukraine, triggered more than 30 supplier collapses at the end of 2021 and the start of last year.  Mr Brearley said energy firms should be allowed to make a “reasonable” level of profit, without expanding on what that could be.

Mum who was switched to prepay energy meter without being told wins £620 in compensation,"Consumer champion Helen Dewdney, also known as The Complaining Cow, explains what happened when she tried to help mum-of-two Claire-Marie after an ordeal with Utility WarehouseA vulnerable energy customer who was switched to a prepayment meter without being told has been awarded over £600 in compensation. Mother-of-two Claire-Marie, 33, said she was effectively left without a way to pay for her energy for four days following the move by Utility Warehouse. The issue started after Claire-Marie, who also had a phone contract with Utility Warehouse, had tried to change her direct debit to match up with her pay day. The worried mum had fallen behind on her bills and said she had been trying to clear her debt by paying extra every month. But because she was in arrears, she ended up being put onto a prepayment meter after struggling to find a resolution with the energy firm. After being helped by consumer champion Helen Dewdney, also known as The Complaining Cow, Claire-Marie has now been awarded £624.    Here, Helen explains what happened... Claire-Marie had been trying for many months to get the monthly payment date for her direct debit changed to correspond with her pay day and clear the debt on the energy account. However, she says Utility Warehouse told her this was not possible as it only allows payment dates on the last or first day of the month. Back in 2021, Claire-Marie had got muddled over one payment and had missed paying the previous month. This meant for about eight months she was paying extra on the 15th of the month to try and clear the balance. But, because she was one month in arrears, the company were cutting off her mobile phone on the 9th or 10th of every month. Although she was clearing the debt “they kept disconnecting my services, rather than allowing me to pay on the 15th as I did every time,” she told me.  This contributed to her anxiety and on one occasion meant that she was unable to ring Lifeline, her GP and the West Yorkshire Mental Health Support team support service. She cancelled the phone part of the contract in February 2021. After ten months of trying to sort out the issue, Utility Warehouse installed a prepayment meter for her gas, without informing her that this had been done. Utility Warehouse installed the meter on December 16 but didn't tell her until December 19 and left no instructions on how to pay. Claire-Marie, her 33-year-old fiancé, 14 and 6-year-old children were without a way to pay for energy for four days. “I honestly felt they were going to leave my family without gas for Christmas,” she told me.  A spokesperson for Utility Warehouse said: “In the customer’s time with Utility Warehouse, our call records show that we have worked with them on a number of occasions to help manage their account.” However, a screenshot I sent Utility Warehouse showing calls made and received on Claire-Marie’s phone did not tally at all with the times given by them. I contacted Utility Warehouse to inform them of their apparent breaches of all four of the following Ofgem standards: behaviour towards consumers, providing information, customer service processes and considering vulnerable domestic customers. There were a number of issues regarding the communication with Utility Warehouse. Under Ofgem standards of performance rules, if you can’t get electricity or gas due to what you think might be a faulty meter, your supplier must attend and repair or replace it within three hours (or four hours on a weekend or bank holiday). The elapsed time starts at the beginning of the next working day if you contact them out of hours. Utility Warehouse appeared to have breached this standard.  Ofgem rules also state: “For unplanned interruptions to your gas supply, you are entitled to at least £60 for every 24 hours it is off. “There are also additional payments and provisions available for households on the Priority Services Register, such as alternative heating and cooking facilities.” I got involved and asked that Utility Warehouse switch on the gas for Claire-Marie’s family as soon as possible. Utility Warehouse said its engineer left instructions on how to top up the meter - but Ring doorbell footage appeared to show otherwise. The energy firm's response to this was: “While we trust the agents to leave the letter behind, we do know that human error can happen. “If that is the case here and a mistake has happened, we are sorry and we will give feedback to our third-party contractors.” But this did not acknowledge the effect this had on their customer. Claire-Marie received a phone call from the company offering her £200 plus £66 late payments, plus £18 debit legal fees refunded. She was also offered payment holidays, the opportunity to leave Utility Warehouse without objection and an alternative repayment plan. If Utility Warehouse had resolved the payment plan problem for Claire-Marie, she would not have incurred those charges. This payment was offered on December 23, so a nice Christmas present. The Utility Warehouse spokesperson said: “Since the meter has been installed, we ensured that the customer was kept on supply by providing her with a top up on their meter and through emergency and friendly credit.” However, this ran out without knowing how to top up. Utility Warehouse believed that the complaint was closed, having received verbal confirmation in a phone call from Claire-Marie. However, I subsequently told Utility Warehouse that it had not offered the right amount. The goodwill offer referred to service and did not include the £60 a day to which Claire-Marie was legally entitled. So, we emailed again to clarify that the payment plan had been agreed but the complaint was not yet closed. I continued the complaint with the CEO escalation team (find details of CEOs and their teams at ceoemail.com) and threatened to take the case further to the Energy Ombudsman. Finally, after sixteen emails from me, Utility Warehouse offered £60 per day for four days plus a further £100 by “way of apology”. Once the matter was finally resolved, a spokesperson for Utility Warehouse said: “We have worked with the customer to resolve this issue and have spoken with her at length on multiple occasions to try and bring this to a satisfactory conclusion. “This includes offering a gesture of goodwill payment, payment holidays, and the opportunity to leave Utility Warehouse without objection and an alternative repayment plan with suitable time to pay arrears. “We have now reached a resolution and consider the matter closed. Should they encounter any further issues, we will do our utmost to resolve these.” Utility Warehouse wanted the payout to be offset against the debt - however, Claire-Marie wished to continue the existing payment plan and have the goodwill gesture and compensation paid into her bank account. I asked Utility Warehouse where the Ofgem guidelines state that compensation can be used against outstanding debt. She has now received the payment into her bank account. The total Claire-Marie received was £624. She told me: “I believe the problems would have gone on much longer without help from someone who knows the rules and persevered. “Thankfully, I had the right support to eventually sort this out, and I just hope no one else is facing this kind of disgraceful treatment and feeling too scared.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/mum-who-switched-prepay-energy-29027595
BT investigated over fears it broke rules when customers signed new deals,"An investigation has been launched into BT Group as Ofcom has 'reasons to suspect' Plusnet, which is a BT subsidiary, may have 'failed to comply' with the regulator's rulesRegulator Ofcom is investigating BT to see whether it broke rules when customer's signed up to new deals. The probe centres will check if the telecoms giant failed to give people ""clear and simple"" contract information for new customers. Since June 2017, telecom providers have been required to give customers contact information and a short, usually one page, summary of the main contract terms before signing up.  The summary must include key information about the price, length of the contract and the terms and conditions if a customer decides to end their contract early. However, an investigation has been launched as Ofcom has ""reasons to suspect"" Plusnet, which is a BT subsidiary, may have ""failed to comply with these requirements"".  This comes after the regulator opened an investigation into EE, another BT subsidiary, in October 2022.   As a result, the Ofcom investigation will now consider if BT has breached Ofcom rules because of the suspected breaches at both EE and Plusnet. The investigation into EE has now closed but Ofcom will be merging this investigation with the one into BT.  BT could also be fined by Ofcom and asked to change its practices. Ofcom said it will continue to gather further information and will provide updates for customers as its investigation progresses. Alongside the contract summary, Ofcom said customers with disabilities can request to receive the documents in an accessible format free of charge.  For example, suppliers must provide the same information in large print or Braille.  Ofcom says these rules are intended to help all customers make ""informed choices"" about the services they are being offered. Commenting on the announcement, Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at Which? said: ""It's extremely concerning that BT is under investigation for potentially failing to provide clear and simple information for new customers at a time when customers under contract with EE, Plusnet and BT are facing huge above-inflation hikes to their bills.

Ofgem to investigate energy suppliers as more Brits forced on to prepayment meters,"Ofgem has warned energy firms that it will take legal action if they are found to not be taking proper due care of vulnerable householdsThe energy watchdog Ofgem has launched an investigation into the number of struggling households forced onto expensive prepayment meters. Ofgem could land suppliers with fines if it discovers wrongdoing by the firms.  The probe came after Business Secretary Grant Shapps, who wrote to Ofgem, warned energy suppliers could be named and shamed.  It comes amid mounting concern about the number of households being forced to have a prepayment meter, often to recover debts. However, with energy bill prices soaring and prepayment meter rates higher than other ways of paying, there is evidence that some households are going without heating and lighting altogether.   Analysis shows courts are waving through suppliers’ applications to install prepayment meters. Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem chief executive, said: “I am concerned about the sharp growth in households struggling to pay their bills being switched over to prepayment meters, sometimes without their even knowing about it, leaving them without heating. “I have spoken to many customers including those who use prepayment meters. “Many families choose this as an option principally to have more control over their budgets. “And used responsibly, they strike the right balance between protecting customers from being cut off and enabling suppliers to recoup debt.  “However, I have heard directly from people who have faced poor practice from suppliers. “For example, one customer I spoke to in Glasgow left to go on holiday and returned to find he’d been switched to prepay without his knowledge and had no way to top up.” Gillian Cooper, head of energy policy for the charity Citizens Advice, said: “We welcome the government’s call for energy suppliers to stop forcing people onto prepayment meters. “Millions of people are being left in cold, dark and damp homes because they can’t afford to top up their meter. No one should be forced to live like this. “It’s now up to suppliers to do the right thing and end this practice. ""If they don’t, the government must step in with stronger action. “It’s also vital further protections are brought in for people already using prepayment meters.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/ofgem-investigate-energy-suppliers-more-29024552
Martin Lewis suggests cheaper alternative for drying clothes that costs 7p an hour,"Martin Lewis Podcast has revealed an ingenious approach to drying wet clothes, suggesting Brits should invest in a dehumidifier as it is ""generally far, far cheaper"" than putting the heating onMartin Lewis has suggested a cheaper alternative for drying clothes - and it costs just 7p an hour.  The money-saving expert has shared a nifty hack, which could save households hundreds of pounds, as the cost of living crisis means many are struggling to make ends meet. It is common knowledge that the tumble dryer is one of the most expensive home appliances to run. According to analysis by uSwitch, a household that dries two loads of washing a week in an average tumble dryer will run up a £106 a year energy bill. In his latest episode of The Martin Lewis Podcast, the popular TV expert has revealed an ingenious approach to drying wet clothes for just 7p an an hour. And the best part about this hack is that Brits will not need to switch the central heating on or run a dryer - a very welcome tip when energy bills are so high.   Martin has suggested that Brits should invest in a dehumidifier as the amount of kilowatt's per hour it uses is ""generally far, far cheaper"" than putting the heating on. He explained that so long as you factor in the cost of purchasing one int he first place, having a dehumidifier will guarantee families lower electricity bills. The MoneySavingExpert founder explained on his show: “Many dehumidifiers have different wattages, the one I checked out was 200 watts (w). “Once we know it’s 200w and we know a kilowatt (kw) is 1,000w, which is how electricity tends to be priced, we know this is a fifth of a kilowatt. “And you pay roughly 34p per kw per hour. A fifth is 7p so you’re going to pay roughly 7p per hour to run a dehumidifier at 200w assuming it uses full power the whole time. Which is generally far, far cheaper than putting the heating on. “If a dehumidifier does work for you it will definitely have lower electricity bills but of course you do have the initial capital outlay of buying a dehumidifier and see how that works for you.”  The financial guru explained that the same method can be used for cooking, advising Brits that they should look into purchasing an air fryer as it may prove cheaper than using an oven or microwave. Martin said: “The problem with the equation for heating equipments is an oven is going to be about 2,000w. “A microwave I believe, from memory… gives you consistent heat whereas an oven is warming up to full temperature and then topping it up so it isn’t running at full power the whole time. “But if you’re doing a jacket potato for 10 minutes it’s going to be far cheaper than doing a single jacket potato in an oven and keeping it on for an hour and a half. “However, if you were doing a full roast dinner and you were cooking many of them, that is where it’s probably cheaper than putting five or six jacket potatoes in a microwave because each additional object you put in a microwave, you need to keep it on longer because a microwave just heats the individual object.” He concluded: “The general equation is: find the wattage of an item, then work out how many kilowatts or what fraction of a kilowatt it’s using, then multiply that by 34p per hour of use. “If you had a 1,000w microwave and you put it on for 10 minutes, one kilowatt for a sixth of an hour, a sixth of 34p is about 6p, shall we say? So it’s 6p turning the microwave on for that amount of time. So yes it’s a very useful equation.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/martin-lewis-suggests-cheaper-alternative-29034255
Major supermarket is offering £5 free fuel voucher - but there is a catch,"Morrisons customers can claim £5 off their bill at the supermarket petrol pump if they belong to this particular rewards scheme, offering discount codes via its appA supermarket is offering £5 worth of free fuel to drivers but not everybody can get the deal. Morrisons customers will get the discount at petrol garages across the UK next week. But motorists have to be a Vodafone customer in order to get their hands on the £5 voucher.  The offer is part of the company's VeryMe rewards scheme and can be claimed via the app. Customers can scan their code and apply the discount at their Morrisons petrol station of choice. But they are advised to be quick if they want money off their next tank, with only 65,000 e-vouchers available. The voucher is available for use between January 23 and 29.   Drivers are warned that the code is only valid for one hour after being claimed via the app. E-vouchers can be redeemed at any of Morrisons' 339 petrol stations across the UK. They cannot be used on self-service pumps, but instead must be presented at the till.  Meanwhile screenshots of the code will not be accepted, according to Vodafone. Fuel prices remain high in the UK, after the price of unleaded petrol peaked at a record £1.91 per litre in July.  Last week, the average price of petrol was £1.49 while diesel came in at £1.69, according to the latest figures from PetrolPrices. Drivers can check the price of fuel at their local Morrisons by using the locator tool on the supermarket's website. Prices can vary, depending on which petrol garage you use to fill up. Petrol prices can also be checked by typing in your postcode on sites such as petrolprices.com.  Drivers can also look out for other discounts offered at supermarket petrol stations. Retailers often offer money off fuel for shoppers who spend a certain amount in store. Loyalty schemes can also save motorists money on their fuel, with some offering as much as 5p off per litre.  One example is BP which offers reward card members one point for every £1 they spend in store or per litre of fuel at the garage. Once they have earned 200 points, customers are entitled to £1 off fuel. Texaco members can also save 1p per litre on fuel via its Star Rewards scheme.

"Exact time Brits will be paid to reduce energy by British Gas, EDF, Octopus, E.ON and more","Tonight will be the second time the National Grid will ask households to cut their energy usage to reduce pressure on the grid - Mirror Money has collected all the details you need to knowHouseholds will be paid to cut their energy use tonight under a new scheme being activated by the National Grid.  Tonight will be the second time the Demand Flexibility Service (DFS) has been launched outside of a trial. To take part, you will need to have a smart meter which can send reading every 30 minutes as this is used to verify the amount you have saved during the scheme.  In the future, the National Grid hopes to further expand the eligibility for the scheme so more customers can join in.  For now though, participating in the service is ""completely optional"" and you do not have to take part if you don’t want to, even if you have signed up to take part.  Mirror Money has compiled together the exact details of tonight's Demand Flexibility Service scheme - from when it will start to which suppliers are taking part. Have you signed up to this scheme to reduce your energy bill? Let us know: mirror.money.saving@mirror.co.uk   What time will it happen and for how long? The National Grid has said the scheme will run tonight from 4.30pm until 6pm. It will be the second night in a row where the scheme will be active, having run from 5pm until 6pm yesterday. Future events could be run up to three or four hours.  These are most likely to be held late afternoon or early evening on weekdays when the demand for electricity is highest. In the window, households taking part will need to reduce their energy consumption dramatically by not using ""power-hungry"" appliances.  These can include washing machines, clothes dryers, dishwashers, electric showers and immersion heaters.  On its website, the National Grid says that small appliances such as modern televisions consume very little electricity, so it won't ""be worth"" adapting usage of these during an event.  The National Grid has reiterated that the scheme is all about reducing your energy use where you can and they are not asking people to ""go without electricity"".   Full list of providers signed up to the Demand Flexibility Service (DFS) The majority of the UK's major suppliers have confirmed they will take part in the National Grid's Demand Flexibility Service, however, some firms have also introduced their own energy-saving initiative as well.

How does much it actually cost to run an electric blanket right now?,"Last year, a number of energy firms announced it was to give their more vulnerable customers electric blankets to help them save on their energy bills but exactly how much do they cost to run?It is a common fact that an electric blanket costs less to run compared to turning on your central heating - but how much could it save you? Last year, a number of energy firms announced it was to give vulnerable customers electric blankets to help them save on their energy bills. This was because the Ofgem Price cap rose significantly in October to £3,549 last year. It was then replaced by the Government's Energy Price Guarantee to protect consumers.  This guarantee however still took the price of the average energy bill up to £2,500 a year until April 2023.    So as the UK continues to battle with the high cost of their energy bills, is investing in an electric blanket the right way to go to save money and keep energy bills down? Most people use electric blankets under their sheets to heat their bed before they get in it.  How much energy do electric blankets use? According to research by the energy comparison site Uswiitch, an average electric blanket uses around 100 watts of energy in the warming stage for a double-sized bed.  This then reduces to around 25 watts when it is turned down to the sleep setting, it will go down even further if you turn off the blanket completely.  This tends to be what most people choose to do.   How much does this cost? Under the current energy price guarantee, the cost of one kWh of electricity averages around 34.0p/kWh (pence per kilowatt hour) for those on a standard variable tariff. As such, a standard electric blanket uses around 100W and under the current guarantee, would cost between 2p and 4p to run at full power for an hour. To get this figure you need to convert the above figure of 100w from watts to kilowatts which is 0.1kW.  This means if you were to leave the blanket on for two hours before going to bed, it would cost between 4p and 8p.  However, it must be noted that this is just an estimation as different electric blankets do have different energy settings, and some can cost more to run than others. Electric blankets can range from 50 watts to 300 watts. Every electric blanket says how much energy it uses at full power with its wattage. This means you can work out yourself how much it will cost to use per kilowatt hour of electricity. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/how-much-actually-cost-run-29026596
Experts reveal if it's cheaper to leave heating on low all day or turn it up high,"According to experts at the Energy Saving Trust, the idea it's cheaper to leave the heating on all day on low is a complete ""myth"" although there are arguments before and againstTemperatures have plunged across parts of the UK and many homes will be wondering how they can run their central heating in the most cost-effective way. When it comes to heating our homes, we all have differing opinions on when to turn the heating on, when to turn it off, how high or low the temperature should be, and how long the heating should be on for each day. However, one question which usually comes up in conversations about central heating, and is a highly debated topic. Is it cheaper to leave the heating on all day but on low, or to only turn it on when you need it? Unfortunately, this question is one without a straightforward answer.   According to experts at the Energy Saving Trust, the idea that it is cheaper to leave the heating on all day on a low light is a complete ""myth"". This is mainly due to problems such as home insulation as older or more draughty homes will allow heat to leak out through windows and doors.  With poor insulation, your boiler will have to work harder to keep your home's temperature at a set level which will use more energy and in turn cost you more money.  The Energy Saving Trust says if you're keeping the heating on all day you're losing energy all day, so it's better to heat your home only when you need it.  Despite this, some engineers have been quoted by MoneySavingExpert as saying that keeping your boiler on low all the time can save you some money. This is because turning your boiler on and off regularly will mean it needs to use more energy to heat your home to your desired temperature. Some experts recommend turning all your radiator valves up to the max and your boiler down to the minimum is the better alternative than turning your heating on and off.  This is because the problem with turning your boiler off can help condensation build up on the walls which can help heat outside the home, which then can allow heat to escape more easily, meaning you spend more on energy as a result. If your home is well-insulated, you may be better off leaving the heating on low as good insulation will prevent too much heat loss from occurring your thermostat will work with your boiler to maintain the temperature with relative ease.   If your home hasn't got good insulation, then you may be better off using a timer and a thermostat to turn your heating on only when you need it.  If you cannot decide what to do, then the energy comparison site Uswitch offers an at-home test which you can try.  Uswitch advises, provided you have a well-insulated home, to take meter readings at the beginning of the week before leaving your boiler on continuously and at the end of the week, you take some meter readings again. You should then repeat the experiment using a thermostat and time to control when your central heating comes on and off.  You can compare your results at the end of this week and you will able to see which method is cheaper for your home.  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/cheaper-leave-heating-low-day-29024670

'My pet insurance won't pay out - what should I do?' Everything you need to know,"Consumer rights guru Martyn James delves into the world of pet insurance, from what exactly it does - and doesn't cover - to what to do if your insurance provider doesn't pay outThe UK has changed dramatically in recent years but we still have national obsessions that are quintessentially British. Over lockdown, an astonishing 3.2 million households purchased or adopted a pet – and a huge and evolving industry has grown up around them, from daycare to specialist food providers.  According to the latest research that almost two thirds of the population have a pet. That’s 13 million dogs, 12 million cats, 1 million rabbits, 600,000 guinea pigs and 200,000 ferrets!  This demand has led to spiralling prices and a worry trend of pet theft – to such a degree that the Government is considering much tougher penalties for pet thieves. And from the complaints I see, the additional costs that pet owners incur are clearly causing concern. Which brings us to the most important pet expenses you’ll encounter - pet insurance and vet bills.   Though many more policies have come on to the market in recent years, lots of people are put off by high prices or confusing contracts. Pet insurance varies considerably like all insurance products but it makes sense to buy the best one you can afford – but that doesn’t always mean the most expensive.  Pet insurance – what you need to know  There are four main types of pet insurance:  Lifetime cover Maximum benefit cover Time limited cover Accident only cover  Lifetime policies: The best policy you can buy is a lifetime policy which covers your pet for treatment for life (in most circumstances), though usually for a set amount each year.  These are the priciest policies but make the most sense for pet lovers. The policies cover you for new illnesses and accidents, not pre-existing conditions. But lifetime policies will pay for ongoing treatment as long as the agreement stays in force (if you renew them each year). The amount paid out is capped each year, so bear in mind that the policies don’t cover limitless expenses for veterinary treatment. The insurance covers various ailments, so your cat could be treated for two separate illnesses in a year, though each illness will have a maximum policy limit.  Maximum benefit policies: If lifetime policies are a little too pricy then the next best policy is the maximum benefit or ‘money limited’ policy.  Just as with lifetime policies, pre-existing conditions are generally not covered. Maximum benefit policies will pay out a capped or fixed amount for each potential medical condition your pet might have. You’ll be able to make claims up to the policy limit for each condition. The big difference here is once you’ve hit that limit, that’s the maximum amount that will be paid out even if the condition is ongoing, though there tends not to be a time limit if you’re under the limit. You’ll still get payouts for new illnesses or conditions but only if they are unrelated to the previous claims. Time limited policies: Though time limited policies look similar to maximum benefit policies, there is one key difference.  The insurance works by setting a fixed limit for each medical treatment. However, as the name suggests, the policy will only cover you for a set time frame from the start of treatment (usually a year). So unlike a maximum benefit policy, once you hit the maximum payout or cross the time deadline, the claim ends. Accident only policies: The cheapest policy you can buy only covers accidents, not conditions that might be diagnosed by a vet. The policy should set out fixed limits for each type of injury and treatment.  Some policies also have a time limit for ongoing treatments. Look for policies that offer emergency treatment for some illnesses too. With the last three policies, if you find that you’ve maxed out your limit for a medical condition, you may still be able to get a good policy elsewhere, however, this will exclude the treatment that you’ve already claimed for.    What should be covered?  It’s not just medical treatments that are covered by pet insurance. Here are some other things to look for in your pet insurance policy. Death payments: No-one wants to think about this eventuality, but it’s worth pointing out that most pet insurance pays a sum in the event of your pet’s death to cover the amount you paid when you purchased it (or what your pet might be worth if it was sold).  After a certain age, these policies will not pay out. Traveling abroad: Surprisingly, your policy might cover you for illness or injury that happens to your pet while abroad.  You’ll need to have followed the rules of entry to that country though, so no sneaking your cat abroad in your purse on the Eurostar. Pet accommodation: Some policies cover the cost of your pet going into kennels, a cattery or other shelter if you fall ill or are hospitalised, leaving the pet alone.  Third party cover: As with other forms of insurance, third party cover is there should your pet injure someone or damage something. This covers legal costs, the other person’s bills and other expenses.  Euthanasia and other death costs: Cremation and euthanasia can be surprisingly expensive, so look for this in your insurance contract.    Problems and things to think about  Much like human illnesses, most complaints about pet insurance involve ongoing medical treatments, disputes over whether a ""new"" condition is related to an older one and ""non-disclosure"" – where the insurer feels you haven’t disclosed a previous medical condition. As with all general insurance products, terms and conditions are very much open to interpretation. If your insurer is relying on unclear or ambiguous terms to reject a claim, you should complain. In addition, if the insurer is giving more weight to their veterinary experts than your vet, you should push back. In recent years, I’ve seen some quite unusual treatments recommended by vets. Again, as with humans, treatments for pets need to be generally accepted as effective and practical. Check with your insurer to find out if the treatment is approved before you pay for it up front. Other things you might assume are covered may not be, like ""preventative"" treatments. This can be anything from spaying, anti-flea treatments and grooming. Some policies will cover dental treatment though expect limitations on when the policy will pay out. The whole process of your pet giving birth may also be excluded.  What if you are unhappy with a claim  If you need to make a claim, speak to the insurer and tell them about the vet’s costs that you’ve been quoted ASAP. Some vets may recommend ""experimental"" treatments that aren’t recognised and might not be covered. We’ve seen dogs sent for hydrotherapy treatments that turned out to be frolicking in a paddling pool in a shed – for hundreds of pounds. So make sure you look into what every treatment involves and how it helps the underlying medical condition. The business must write to you with their decision on the claim. Set out what you don’t think is fair in your own words and ask the firm to reconsider its decision. You can ask your vet to get involved too if the insurer is ignoring their advice. Ultimately, you can take your complaint to the free Financial Ombudsman Service.

Royal Mail stamp deadline: Everything you need to know as millions to become worthless,"Classic stamps are being replaced by ones with barcodes, which allow recipients to watch videos and greeting messages from senders - but when is the deadline to use old stamps?Royal Mail customers have been left confused by an upcoming deadline to use old stamps before they become worthless.  Classic stamps are being replaced by ones with barcodes, which allow recipients to watch videos and greeting messages from senders.  The deadline for which you have to use older stamps is January 31, 2023 - but the Royal Mail has now introduced a six month “grace period”. This means you technically have until July 31, 2023 before they become worthless. But to complicate matters, the Royal Mail still says you have to use your old stamps by January 31.  This has understandably left some people scratching their heads.  “Royal Mail website still saying old stamps are expiring end of Jan even tho [sic] they supposedly pushed back the deadline,” wrote one person on Twitter.  So what's going on? Here is what you need to know.  When is the deadline to use old stamps?  You can continue to use old stamps until July 31, 2023. This is covered by the six-month ""grace period"" from the January 31 deadline. As the Royal Mail is not calling it an official extension, this is why its website still says the deadline as January 31 - despite this confusing people. But rest assured, you can still keep using your older stamps until July 31. In the FAQs section on the Royal Mail website, it states: “Mail posted with non-barcoded Definitive stamps after 31 January 2023, will for the first six month be delivered as normal, no surcharge will be raised.” Royal Mail moved the deadline back to give people more time to adjust to the change.   What happens if I use an old stamp after July 31?  After this date, Royal Mail will treat any post sent with non-barcoded stamps as having insufficient postage. This means you may need to pay a fee. For example, sending a letter or large letter currently incurs a £2.50 fee where no postage has been paid at all on a regular sized or large letter.  Are there any exceptions?  Yes, you can still use commemorative and non-barcoded Christmas stamps even after July 31.  I’m worried I won’t use my old stamps by July 31 - what can I do?  You can exchange your old stamps for free through the Royal Mail 'Swap Out' scheme. To do this, download a 'Swap Out' form on the Royal Mail website, call up Royal Mail on 03457 740740, or pick up a form from a local delivery office or Post Office. If you’re downloading the form online and you don't have access to a printer, you can instead complete a web form and request for it to be posted to you. Once you’ve filled it out, post back the stamps you want to swap using the Freepost address. Your new barcode stamps should then arrive in seven days. You will need to complete a standard form for stamps worth up to £200, or a Bulk Stamp form for stamps worth more than £200. There is no limit on the number of forms you can request. There is also currently no deadline for swapping old stamps, although it’s best to do it sooner rather than later in case an end date does get announced.

Thousands of households could get up to £500 in free supermarket vouchers - how to claim,"Local councils distribute their funding at their own discretion so the criteria to be able to claim the free supermarket vouchers varies between each authorityThousands of low-income families could be entitled to free supermarket vouchers worth up to £500 through a council help scheme. Councils are providing this type of help through the Household Support Fund which is money given by the central Government specifically to help vulnerable households.  Each council gets a different portion of funding depending on the size of the catchment area, population, and need. They distribute the funding at their own discretion - this means the help on offer varies up and down the country. Some councils might give out energy vouchers or free cash grants instead of supermarket vouchers. The majority of councils detail the help they are offering and who they are giving it to on their website, so you can check what help is available to claim and how exactly you can claim it.    Some councils will contact you directly while others require you to apply directly online, or over the phone. Luton Borough Council provides supermarket vouchers as part of their Household Support scheme with eligible residents able to claim between £100 to £500 worth of vouchers.  Luton Council says it only accepts one claim per household and will tell you the exact amount you are eligible for after assessing your claim.  Plymouth City Council is also offering supermarket vouchers of up to £180 which can be spent at either Asda, Morrisons, or Tesco.  Like Luton, only one application can be made per household and the help can only be accessed if you did not receive support from the previous Household Support Fund between July 6, 2022 and November 27, 2022.  Households in Camden and Ealing are providing supermarket vouchers to households with children under 18 years who are receiving Housing Benefit or Council Tax support or who are eligible for free school meals.  In Camden, households will get £15 worth of vouchers for every child who lives in the home in February 2023 and in Ealing households will receive £15 per child in February and another £30 per child in March.  North Yorkshire County Council is also offering supermarket e-vouchers of up to £325 through their Household Support fund which can be spent in Aldi, Asda, M&S, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Tesco, and Waitrose.  North Yorkshire Council has sent letters to all eligible households and they have until Wednesday, February 15 to select their e-voucher.  To claim, you will need to enter a personalised code which you will receive in your letter into North Yorkshire Councils Household Support Fund web page.  If you think you may be eligible to claim through the Household support fund then you will need to make an application as soon as you can.  While the deadline for councils to hand out the latest round of cash support is March 31, 2023, it's done on a first-come-first-serve basis so the sooner you make a claim, the more chance you will be successful.  The Government has said that all Household Support Funding needs to be spent before the end of March and it cannot be carried over for future usage.

Martin Lewis issues 'danger' warning to anyone using a debit card,"Money saving expert Martin Lewis explained why debit cards are not always good and how they are in fact the worst way to borrow money during his ITV Money Show LiveMartin Lewis has issued an urgent warning to anyone who uses a debit card and is regularly overdrawn. On last week's episode of The Martin Lewis Money Show Live, the financial guru spent the entire 60 minute show talking about debt and how to clear it. He explained how overdrafts are actually the most expensive way to go about borrowing money. An overdraft lets you borrow money through your current account by taking out more money than you have in the account. You'll go into your overdraft when you go below your current bank balance. ""Most consumer overdrafts are now 40%, double a high street credit card, which means debit cards are now danger cards if you're overdrawn.""   The money saving expert gave several pieces of advice around paying back debt, including using balance transfers to shift expensive debts onto 0% interest credit cards. He also advised people to in serious trouble to contact services like StepChange if they are in real difficulty. ""Now the first thing if you're overdrawn is to check your eligibility for a 0% overdraft and to what amount,"" he continued. ""People also ask me, can I shift my overdraft onto a 0% card? The answer is yes, but only a few specialist cards. It's called a money transfer.  ""With a money transfer card you apply for a new card and it pays the money into the bank account for you so you can get rid of your overdraft, you now owe the card. ""It's best for large overdrafts, you need a decent credit history."" Martin advised people to treat an overdraft ""like every other debt"" and trying to shift your direct debits to just before payday. ""The longer you're overdrawn, the bigger your interest charges,"" he explained. ""So if you can move it to just before payday, you won't be in debt for as long and it should reduce the interest.""  Martin said the rules change for those who have multiple debts. In this case, he advised people to list all their debts in order of interest rates, with the highest first. ""Then you take all the spare cash you possibly have and you pay the highest interest rate ignoring the others,"" he added. ""When this one goes, you then focus on clearing the next-highest interest rate. ""Once that goes, you clear the next and the next and so on. It's known as snowballing and it means you get rid of your debts more quickly."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/martin-lewis-issues-danger-warning-29024199
Cheapest places to get petrol and diesel - as prices fall to lowest since February,"The AA said it was seeing a ""pump price superstore turf war"" in areas where there were multiple different supermarkets in close proximityThe cost of petrol has fallen to the lowest price the UK has seen since February last year and for diesel since last March, according to the AA. The average UK petrol price was 148.59p a litre on Wednesday, while diesel was down to 170.71p. These are falls of 4.4p and 5.0p a litre respectively compared to just before Christmas. On Monday, the motor insurance collected the average pump price from all major brand retailers, it also looked at the disparities between prices across different parts of the UK.  This analysis revealed which drivers were the ""lucky ones"" in regard to the cost of filling up their tank.  Of course, the below figures from the AA only take into account the supermarkets and mainstream petrol stations - it doesn't include any independent fuel stations.   Pump prices on Monday, January 16 Average petrol price per litre   Asda - 144.50p BP - 151.17p Esso - 150.15p Jet - 147.57p Morrisons - 145.54p Murco - 148.13p Sainsbury's - 146.41p Shell - 148.54p Tesco - 146.72p Texaco - 148.71p  Average diesel price per litre:  Asda - 166.43p BP - 173.90p Esso - 172.79p Jet - 170.02p Morrisons - 167.82p Murco - 171.48p Sainsbury's - 168.68p Shell - 169.78p Tesco - 169.07p Texaco - 171.16   The AA's analysis also revealed that there were ""major price gaps"" between different areas of the UK.  The most obvious gap was the cost of diesel in Northern Ireland which averages at 10p cheaper than London and the South East of England.  In Wales, the average price difference with southern England was around 6p a litre.  The AA also noted that at a more local level and ""largely restricted"" to certain areas of the UK that even bigger price gap anomalies have emerged. Last weekend, supermarket petrol in Ashton-under-Lyne was as much as 13p a litre cheaper than 10 miles up the road in Rochdale, which is a saving of around £7.15 a tank. In the neighbouring town, the cheapest supermarket petrol was 145.7p.   The AA noted that they were seeing supermarkets raging a ""pump price superstore turf war"" in areas where there were multiple different stores in close proximity with fuel prices dropping dramatically as they fought for customers.  Luke Bosdet, the AA’s spokesman on road fuel prices said: “Discovering that supermarket petrol or diesel is £5 to £7 a tank more expensive than just 10 miles down the road is guaranteed to leave drivers livid.  ""It just doesn’t make sense, particularly when other essentials like bread, milk and eggs are pretty much the same price wherever you go,”  ""Say, for instance, a supermarket lures you into their store with a voucher offering £6 off a £60 shopping bill. ""To find out that that supermarket clawed back all that saving, and perhaps £1 on top of that, at the pump compared to a superstore in a neighbouring town will quite rightly lead to a howl of protest. The AA says that supermarkets can ""get away"" with this because the fuel price transparency that the Competition and Markets Authority recommended to the Government in October doesn’t yet exist in England, Wales and Scotland.  It does however exist in Northern Ireland where the AA's analysis has proven to be offering significantly lower petrol and diesel costs.

Renters could be owed thousands if their landlord does not follow this one rule,"According to UK housing law, if landlords are renting a single property to multiple residents they need to licence it with the local council if they don't then you could be owed a lot of moneyRenters could be due a refund of 12 months' rent if their landlord has not properly licenced the property they are living in. According to UK housing law, if landlords are renting a single property to multiple residents they need to licence the property with the local council.  The council can then check if the property meets the right standards for multiple occupancies.  Other types of rental property may also have to be licensed under local council rules. If your landlord hasn't licensed your rental property properly then you could be owed a refund through a rent repayment order (RRO) which could amount to a few thousand pounds. A tenant or the council can apply for this through a tribunal, and a council might offer help doing this as they run the licencing scheme.   If you are to do this there most likely will be fees involved, however, these fees can be claimed back if you are successful.  The amount you would get back depends on how much rent you pay. If the rent for your entire property is £750, then you could be entitled to a refund for the entire year which would equate to £9000, if the landlord is ordered by the tribunal to repay the entire amount.   If you receive Housing Benefit for rent or have used Universal Credit to pay your rent then this can be reclaimed from the landlord by the council or the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).  The charity Shelter, which campaigns for tenant rights, says your landlord must have a house in multiple occupations (HMO) licence from the council if these two things apply to the property:   you share with four or more other people there are two or more separate households   HMO licences usually last around five years, however in some areas, councils make landlords apply more often. Shelter also highlighted that an HMO licence cannot be transferred to another person so If your landlord changes, they will have to reapply for the licence. If your landlord does not have an HMO licence, then alongside having to repay rent, they cannot evict you from the property with a section 21 notice or ""no-fault eviction"" notice and they can be banned from renting out properties. According to the group, Justice for Tenants, you can also apply for a rent repayment order if:  The landlord has not complied with a council notice The tenant has been harassed or evicted without the correct paperwork.

How to cut energy bills by up to £500 without having to buy a new boiler,"Boilers usually make up around 50% of your yearly energy bill and Uswitch says that the lowest-grade models can waste around 40% of the money you spend on your gasOld gas boilers can waste up to £500 a year in energy bills however you can prevent this by following some relatively simple and free home hacks. According to the energy comparison site Uswitch, there are 23million homes with a gas boiler in the UK however a lot of these boilers may not be running as well as they could be. Boilers usually make up around 50% of your yearly energy bill and Uswitch says that the lowest-grade models can waste around 40% of the money you spend on your gas.  When you compare these figures to the current typical energy bill of £2,500, around £1,250 is believed to be the boiler cost, and as 40% is wasted, with a rough estimate you could possibly be wasting around £500 each year through an inefficient boiler.    Ben Galilizzi, energy expert at Uswitch explained modern boiler systems that have been looked after with regular boiler maintenance burn their fuel ""more efficiently"" than old models that have ""been neglected"". He told ThisisMoney.co.uk: ""'Looking after your boiler on a regular basis will also reduce the risk of gas leaks, and improve protection within your home, including carbon monoxide safety."" If you are unable to fork out for a brand new boiler, which according to Uswitch can run up to around £1,500, there are a few ways to get the most out of your old one for free. However, the comparison firm did note that it was always a good idea to have a professional check your boiler regularly as this will help guarantee it is running as smoothly, safely and efficiently as possible.  Set a timer for your boiler A boiler timer lets you set the hours when you want your heating and hot water on during the day. By setting a timer, you can make sure the heating in your home is on only when someone is there to use it so you are not wasting hours of heating when there is no need to have it on.  If you have an older boiler, you can set a timer on it by manually setting the dial on the boiler to the current time and you can then choose what time you want the boiler to come on by changing the pins which are located around the dial. For example, if you want your boiler to turn on from 7-8 AM, then set the four pins between seven and eight to the “On” position. You can then set the switch to the timer function to activate your boiler.   Reduce your boiler flow rate Uswitch says that around 80% of homes have a combi boiler in the UK and if you have one you should consider reducing the flow rate on it to help you save some cash. The ""flow temperature"" is the temperature your boiler heats up the water to before sending it off to your radiators. Most households run the flow rate at around 80 degrees, but this temperature can be safely lowered with little impact on the useable hot water in most cases. If you reduce its flow temperature to 60 degrees can save £112 a year on energy bills, according to figures from charity Nesta.    Bleed your radiators By bleeding your radiators, you can release any air that has become trapped inside and will then allow the entire surface of the radiator to produce heat, meaning lower energy bills for the same level of household warmth. To bleed it, you will need to have a radiator key, which can be purchased online or in most hardware stores. You then insert the key to turn the valve at the top of the radiator, you should hear a hissing sound which is just the trapped air escaping. Once this has stopped you can retighten the valve.  Check your boiler pressure All boilers should have a pressure gauge, with modern boilers it is on the front and with older boilers, it may be underneath amongst the pipework. Most boilers run best at pressures between 1 and 1.5 bar, any lower than this and your heating system costs more as it becomes inefficient. As not all boilers are the same, you can refer to your boiler's specific manual which can explain the ways you can increase the pressure If the pressure is too high it can lead to faults with your heating system, and according to British Gas the most common culprits are the pressure valves which may have come loose or the radiators.  If it's the valves you will need to tighten them, and if it is the radiators you can bleed them to reduce the pressure load.  If you have done these steps and the problems are still there, then you are advised to call a boiler professional to address the problem.

Lloyds and Halifax to shut 40 more banks this year - see full list of branches,"Lloyds Banking Group, which owns both banks, will shut 22 Lloyds branches and 18 Halifax sites - see the full list of affected towns and cities belowLloyds and Halifax will close another 40 branches this year as more banks disappear from the high street. Lloyds Banking Group, which owns both banks, will shut 22 Lloyds branches and 18 Halifax sites. It comes on top of the 14 Lloyds banks and five Halifax branches that had already been earmarked for closure this year. The latest closures will happen between April and June this year.

She used a cheap window insulation kit on her windows and posted the results. In her video she lists the good points she found about using the window insulation, writing: ""Room felt warmer, less heat loss = saving on bills, no condensation on windows, cheap, easy to fit, can open window.""  Claire shows the product with the packaging which looks to be a plastic sheet to cover over the window. She then cuts to a clip of her windows which look clean and clear, with nothing to indicate there was anything on them.  In a previous video she showed herself putting the sheet up which she taped around her window and cut to size. She then uses a hair dryer to heat up the product so it shapes better to the window, giving a less obvious look.    She wrote: ""Sounds too good to be true"" as she pushed against the now taught plastic protecting her window. Each criteria was bullet pointed and ticked off after her test, showing that it worked for her home. Claire added in the caption: ""As air temp decreases the volume of moisture it can hold decreases (a room at 20c can hold twice the amount of water vapour that a room at 10c can). When the warmer air hits a cold surface it causes condensation.  ""Therefore, these kits will help increase the room temp marginally (by reducing heat loss through inefficient windows) and stop the windows attracting condensation but won't eliminate air moisture if your house is poorly heated and/or ventilated - so if you suffer with very bad condensation due to the heating being off a lot use with a dehumidifier if you can.  ""In short, these are fantastic value at £3.50 and will deffo help but won't fix all your problems on their own."" Commenters asked where she purchased this clever condensation clearing kit from and although Claire did not answer with where she specifically had got hers, one helpful commenter added that they could be purchased on Amazon.

How much your mortgage bill could fall by this year if rates continue to drop,"New research from wealth manager Quilter shows the average mortgage payments rose by 66% in the last year - but rates are starting to drop which could mean big savingsMonthly mortgage payments could fall by around 25% by the end of the year, new analysis suggests, in what would be welcome news for homeowners.  Mortgage borrowers have been hit by rocketing costs due to nine Bank of England interest rate rises - the base rate is now at 3.5% - and the infamous Mini Budget.  New research from wealth manager Quilter shows average mortgage payments rose by 66% in the last year. At their peak, mortgage rates soared above 6% in September 2022 - but deals have started to climb down and the cheapest fixed rate is now 4.34%. Quilter has now looked at how your mortgage could be impacted if rates continue to fall over the next few months.   The latest Government house price index data shows the average UK property cost £294,910 in November 2022. During this period, mortgage rates were still at around 6%. This means those who purchased a property at this price and mortgage rate with a term of 25 years and an 80% loan to value ratio faces a monthly mortgage payment of £1,520.  This is a huge 66% increase on the £918 monthly mortgage payment this same person would have paid a year earlier when rates were 2% and house prices were 10.3% lower.  Halifax Building Society predicts house prices will fall by 8% in November 2023, while mortgages could continue to dip as well. If mortgage rates continue to fall to around 4% and house prices drop to £271,317 as predicted, analysis from Quilter suggests mortgage payments would fall by 25% compared to a year earlier to £1,145. Of course, various factors will impact the exact amount that mortgage payments will fall by, including the loan to value level, the cost of the property, and the mortgage term length.   It is also impossible to predict how the mortgage market will react over the next year - this is just based on predictions. Quilter notes some parts of Britain have been hit harder than others in terms of house prices and mortgage costs. The North West of England saw a 13.5% increase in the average house price between November 2021 and November 2022. When combined with the 6% mortgage interest rates seen during November 2022, the average monthly mortgage payment for someone with a loan to value of 80% increased by 70% year on year. Those living in London saw the smallest percentage increase in monthly payments as house prices. This is because those living in the capital saw a much lower increase of 6.3% over the year to November 2022, but they were still up 58.6% to £2,796 a month. Karen Noye, mortgage expert at Quilter said: “Rising mortgage rates have played a significant role in the affordability of buying a first home or moving home, and for many these costs were pushed to unaffordable highs. “It is therefore a real positive that looking forward we can hope to see such a significant dip in monthly mortgage payments by the end of the year should house prices and mortgage rates continue to fall as expected. “However, there is no guarantee that the changes in the housing market will materialise in the way that has been predicted.  “Inflation is still incredibly high and people’s buying power has taken a real hit as a result, particularly with rising energy bills, but thankfully we look to now be moving past the peak.  “Lower inflation should mean interest rates stabilise and even start to drop with mortgage rates following suit. This could result in mortgage rates dropping to 4% by the end of the year and potentially even lower in the future which will have a real impact on monthly mortgage costs.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/how-much-your-mortgage-bill-29007465
Millions of homes hit by £116 energy bill hike - despite prices being fixed,"Those who have seen their bills increase were customers on Economy 7 electric tariffs which new analysis found rose by 7.6% on average this JanuaryMillions of households in the UK saw their annual energy bill go up by an average of £116 this January even though prices should be fixed until April.  Those who have seen their energy bills rise are on Economy 7 electric tariffs which means they pay a different price for electricity at different times of the day.  With this tariff, you usually pay more for energy during the day than you do overnight.  According to figures released by Future Energy Associates, those on this tariff saw an increase of 7.6% to their energy bills this year. Energy companies who supply this tariff can set their own rates and were allowed to increase them on January 1 when the new Ofgem price cap came into force.    On January 1 2023, Ofgem's price cap rose by 20% to £4,279 a year for a typical household. The price cap changes every three months and underpins the Government's Energy Price Guarantee, which provides a discount on those rates.  This discount brings typical bills down to £2,500 a year until April 2023, with the Government offsetting the difference. The analysis found that due to the average rise of 7.6%, those on the Economy 7 tariff are now paying on average 46% more than others on electricity-only tariffs. The consultancy says a typical Economy 7 annual bill is now £2,964, far higher than the Government's Energy Price Guarantee figure of £2,500.  Clement Attwood from Future Energy Associates said: “It is a little known fact that it is actually up to the supplier to determine rates for some tariffs that are not explicitly capped by the current Energy Price Guarantee rate. “This has caused the average electrical Economy 7 tariff to be more expensive than the average active electrical constant rate tariff.  “We also saw a higher level of variation between dual fuel and electricity-only tariffs than we expected, which will hit those on the margins of fuel poverty the hardest. “Price variations similarly do occur by region and certain regions consistently have more expensive tariffs.”  Energy regulator Ofgem has responded to the analysis saying even with the 7.6% increase, those on Economy 7 tariffs will still be paying less than the government's price guarantee. An Ofgem spokesperson said: “Electricity use is higher in winter for people with electric heating systems designed to use peak- and off-peak meters.  ""This will balance out across the rest of 2023 so average bills are less than people on other meters.  ""The bottom line is if Economy 7 customers use cheaper off-peak electricity for night-storage heaters, they can make substantial savings. They will pay more if they use more peak-time electricity.""  The energy regulator urged Economy 7 customers to speak to their supplier about alternative options if they believe their energy bill is too high. It added: ""“Customers have the power to switch to a new deal if it will cut their costs are rising because they don’t use electricity at night. ""Our licence requires suppliers to give customers information about the cheapest Economy 7 tariff or cheapest tariff on other meters.”  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/millions-homes-hit-116-energy-29004358
Six things you need to know before January 31 tax deadline if you have a second job,"Around 1.2million people are said to have a second job in the UK and with extra income, there comes tax implications Brits will need to be aware ofIf you have a second job, then there are six things you will need to be aware of ahead of the self-assessment tax deadline on January 31.  The Office of National Statistics (ONS) estimates that around 1.2 million workers in the UK have a second job. With the cost of living rising every day, it's likely more and more Brits will follow suit and look for additional work. While the extra income will be a necessity for so many, it doesn't come without tax implications that you will need to be aware of.  Experts at the tax and accountancy software platform, Crunch, have compiled together answers to the most Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about tax when you have a second job.    Do you need to tell HMRC if you get a second job? You may need to talk to HMRC about your second job, however, this will all depend on whether you’re employed or self-employed in each of your jobs.  You don’t need to talk to HMRC if you’re employed in both jobs If you’re employed in your first job and self-employed in your second job you’ll need to register for Self Assessment on the HMRC website If you’re self-employed in both jobs, you don’t need to contact HMRC if you’re already registered for Self Assessment for your first job.   Can my employer stop me from having a second job?  The tax experts at Crunch warn that your employer may be able to stop you from getting a second job if there’s a clause in your contract about taking on additional work.  However, in most cases, these clauses may only prevent you from working for clients, suppliers, or other companies within the same sector. This is because it could cause a ""conflict of interest"" which can take a variety of forms. However, a common type of conflict of interest with a second job can be if you work for one company which provides you with specific information and you use that information at your second job which doesn't have this info, then that is a conflict of interest.  Crunch also added: ""If your second job clearly impacts your performance in your main job, your employer may have grounds for dismissal.   Do you need a P45 for a second job?  Crunch highlighted that you do not need to have a P45 for a second job, however, you’ll need to tell your second employer that you already have another job and won’t be able to provide a P45.  Instead, they’ll ask you to fill out a Starter form which was previously known as a P46.  Do you get taxed more if you have two jobs?  The tax and accountancy software firm says this answer can be both yes and no.  The group said: ""You don’t get taxed more for having two jobs. Instead, your tax bill is based on your total income for the tax year.  ""So while you won’t be penalised for having a second job, you’ll naturally pay more tax because you’re earning more money overall.""  Do you pay more tax on a second job?  Crunch says you will ""usually"" pay more tax on a second job.  This is because your tax-free Personal Allowance of £12,570 is applied to your first job and you don’t get another tax-free allowance for a second job.  The experts added: ""So assuming you’ve used up your whole allowance on your first job, you’ll pay tax on all the earnings for your second job."" This is because you will need to pay 20% of the whole amount of the income on your second income.  Things are different however if your combined income is below the personal allowance threshold or if you second job pushes your overall income into the higher tax bracket.  Do you pay National Insurance on a second job?  You only need to pay National Insurance on your second job if your second employer pays you over £242 per week.  Unlike tax, National Insurance is calculated on a job-by-job basis.  So if you earn £1,000 per week on your first job and £200 per week on your second job, you’ll only pay National Insurance on the first job.

Sainsbury's shoppers about to see HUGE change in 237 stores as key service disappears,"LloydsPharmacy has revealed it is cutting all 237 of its branches in Sainsbury's stores across the UK in 2023 following a review, with the number of job losses unknownSainsbury’s is set to lose its in-store pharmacies across all its stores, it has been announced. LloydsPharmacy revealed it has cut its services following a recent strategic review and blamed “changing market conditions”. The chain had 237 sites within the supermarket which will be removed over 2023. It has not revealed how many pharmacy workers the removals will affect. Kevin Birch, chief executive officer of LloydsPharmacy, said: “This decision has not been an easy one and we understand that our patients and customers may have questions about how the change will affect them “We would like to thank them for their continued support and assure them that we are committed to providing a smooth transition over the coming months.   “I am very grateful to all our colleagues for their dedication to our patients, customers and communities.” The decision comes seven years after LloydsPharmacy first snapped up the pharmacies from the retailer for £125 million. It runs around 1,400 pharmacies across the UK. A Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: “LloydsPharmacy is withdrawing pharmacy services from our stores over the coming months. “We will work with them to ensure customers are clear on how they can access an alternative pharmacy provision to meet their needs.” Mark Pitt, Assistant General Secretary of the PDA Union added: “We have seen many disposals of LloydsPharmacy branches over recent months and we know more may occur, however for every disposal there has been a buyer, therefore patients and communities have seen no reduction in availability, the pharmacy network has not lost capacity and there were no job losses.   “This situation is different and means significant reductions in access to a pharmacy for patients and we expect those who represent communities to be concerned about the loss of a key part of their local NHS service.  “Forward-thinking governments around the UK are seeking to make greater use of pharmacies as the most accessible contact point in the NHS, to reduce pressure on other parts of the healthcare system, so there should be greater community pharmacy capacity, not less. “The PDA Union will be working tirelessly to avoid job losses for pharmacists, and we will be protecting their interests. It’s important in these situations that any distress caused to individuals is kept to a minimum and that everyone is treated with respect and dignity. “Those pharmacists who are PDA members can contact our service centre for advice in due course and in the meantime should ensure they read communications from the PDA.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/shopping-deals/sainsburys-shoppers-see-huge-change-29001812
Calls for ban on forced pre-pay meters as campaigners warn 'every delay will lead to deaths',"Campaigners are calling for energy firms in the UK to be banned from forcefully installing prepayment meters that risk the poorest in the country being left without heatingThe Government is under mounting pressure to ban energy firms from forcing customers to have prepayment meters. Groups including Fuel Poverty Action and the National Pensioner’s Convention yesterday (Thursday) ramped-up calls for the practice to be halted amid fears that some of Britain’s poorest households are being left without heating as temperatures plummet. A recent report from Citizens Advice found an estimated 3.2 million people could not afford to top-up their energy meter last year. It said more than one in five prepayment meter customers cut off in the past year spent at least 24 hours without gas or electricity, leaving them unable to turn the heating on or cook a hot meal. It comes amid evidence that courts are routinely waving through applications from energy suppliers to force entry in people’s homes to fit the meters.   An investigation by the i newspaper found just 72 out of more than 500,000 such applications have been refused since July 2021. Protestors took part at an event in Westminster yesterday to highlight the plight of those living in cold and damp homes. Ruth London, Fuel Poverty Action co-founder, said, “We need an outright ban, and urgent removal of the hundreds of thousands of meters that have been installed where they are not safe or practical in defiance of suppliers’ licence conditions. “The energy suppliers were quick to find men to drill out locks and break into homes to install these meters, now they must act quickly to take them out. “People are being left in the cold and dark even when they are dependent on heat or on power for disability aids, medical equipment, for light and for charging phones. “Every delay will lead to deaths.”  Jan Shortt, general secretary of the National Pensioners’ Convention, said: “It’s shameful that anyone in this country should die as a result of the cold. “Yet tens of thousands more will do so if the government does not act as a matter of urgency.”  Business Secretary Grant Shapps raised hopes this week that he was preparing to take action as he told MPs in the Commons he was preparing to write to the regulator Ofgem.  Labour has called for an immediate halt to the “shameful” forced installation of prepay gas and electricity meters. Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband recently accused the government of a “dereliction of duty”. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/household-bills/calls-ban-forced-pre-pay-29002684
Thousands of homes could save £350 on energy bills by making six easy changes,"The energy advice from Citizens Advice includes turning appliances off standby, draught proofing windows and doors and not overfilling the kettle - and you could save a substantial amountHouseholds could save £350 on their energy bills by making six simple changes in their home. This is according to new tips pulled together by Citizens Advice and Energy Savings Trust. The advice includes turning appliances off standby, draught proofing windows and doors and not overfilling the kettle. These may sound obvious changes to make, but they could make a big difference to your energy bill in the long-run - without impacting your lifestyle.  Energy bills are a huge source of worry for many Brits right now after prices sky-rocketed over the last year.  The typical energy bill for an average household is £2,500 because of the Energy Price Guarantee - although this isn't an absolute cap on what you pay.   The Energy Price Guarantee puts a limit on how much you can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity you use, along with the standing charges. This means if you use more energy, you'll pay more - or reduce your consumption, and you'll pay less. The Energy Price Guarantee is due to rise to £3,000 in April.  Cut your energy bill by £350   Turning your appliances off standby could save you £65 a year Draught proofing windows, doors and blocking cracks around your home could save you up to £125 a year Turning off lights when you leave a room could save you £25 a year Washing your clothes at 30 degrees and doing one less machine run a week could save you around £34 a year Reducing your shower time to 4 minutes can save you £95 a year Avoiding overfilling the kettle could save you £13 a year  Total savings: £357   Gillian Cooper, head of energy policy for Citizens Advice, said: “Millions of people are struggling with sky high energy bills.   “These expert tips should help you safely save money and make sure you’re getting all the support you’re entitled to.  “We also know many people are already doing everything they can and are still stretched beyond their limit. “If you’re in this situation, you’re not alone - talk to your supplier or come to Citizens Advice for free, independent support.”  Citizens Advice has this week put together TikTok videos to help people manage their energy bills - you can view these savings tips here.

Energy bills could drop by hundreds of pounds towards the end of the year,"The current forecasts from energy consultants Cornwall Insight are about £300 a year lower than its previous expectations due to the recent fall in wholesale gas pricesEnergy bills could fall hundreds of pounds lower than previously thought by the end of the year, according to new predictions. Experts at Cornwall Insight say the typical bill under the Ofgem price cap could drop to around £2,200 a year from July. This is around £300 less than previously forecast due to wholesale gas prices falling. Cornwall Insight suggests the typical household bill will be £3,209 from April - although households will remain covered by the Energy Price Guarantee. The Energy Price Guarantee will rise to £3,000 from April and has effectively overridden the Ofgem price cap. If the Ofgem price cap falls in line with predictions, it will mean the Energy Price Guarantee will cost the Government less money to subsidise.   Without backing from the Government the average household would pay £4,279 per year for their energy bills from now until April. If the price cap falls to £2,200 in July, it means the Government would not have to subsidise energy bills at all. Cornwall Insight does expect bills to rise slightly again in October, with the price cap predicted to hit £2,241. Gas prices have plummeted in recent weeks, and have more than halved since early December.  Even though wholesale gas is cheaper than it has been for over a year at around 150p per therm, it is still around three times higher than at the beginning of 2021. Cornwall Insight noted that due to this, the political debate going forward is likely to ""centre on household bills remaining about double the level that they were prior to the recent crisis, but with much less support available"".   Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight said: ""As our price cap forecasts fall yet again, it is only natural that people will begin to assume our predictions will stay on a downward trajectory.  ""But, we really don’t have a precedent to look to work out how the market will evolve in 2023."" Dr Lowrey noted that there was a long way to go before the UK can be certain of what the true unit rate will be beyond the summer and warned that things could rapidly turn around again if global markets get spooked. He added: ""Reading too much, too early, into prices falling, could be just as risky as reading too much, too early into prices rising."" Cornwall Insight and other energy experts have long forecasted that energy prices are not going to fall back to what used to be considered ""normal"" levels until the end of the decade at the very least.

Argos to close all 34 stores in Ireland with almost 600 jobs at risk - see full list,"The retailer has 34 stores across Ireland and employs around 580 people with the hours worked by staff equating to around 330 full-time rolesArgos has announced plans to close all its stores in the Republic of Ireland by the end of June this year. The retailer has 34 stores across Ireland and says it will be entering talks with around 580 workers to discuss their options. Argos, which is owned by Sainsbury's Group, said its last stores will shut by June 24 2023. Customers in Ireland will no longer be able to pay for orders through its website or place orders via its home delivery service after March 22. Orders placed up to this date will continue to be fulfilled and customers will still be able to reserve products online and pay for them in-store. Its stores in Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales are unaffected by the announcement.    Argos said it arrived at the decision to leave Ireland following a long period of ""careful consideration"" and a ""thorough review"" of its business and operations in the country. The company said the investment required to develop and modernise the Irish part of its business was ""not viable"" and the money would be better invested in other parts of the company. Argos said it would consult with staff and the trade union Mandate, and offer an ""enhanced redundancy package"" that goes ""well beyond"" its statutory obligations. However, it did say a ""small number"" of staff will not be eligible for redundancy under Irish law and were set to receive a ""one-off goodwill payment"".  The company said it was also committed to a programme of wider support to staff over the coming months. Andy McClelland, Operations Manager at Argos Ireland said: “We understand this is difficult news for our customers and colleagues. As with any major change to our business, we have not made this decision lightly and we are doing everything we can to support those impacted.  ""On behalf of everyone at Argos, I would like to thank our colleagues, customers, suppliers and partners for their support to our business.”  The Mandate Trade Union expressed its disappointment at Argos’s decision to close all of its outlets in Ireland and said it would be ""engaging intensively"" with the company to get the ""best deal possible"" for workers who were being made redundant.  Mandate official Michael Meegan said: “Today is a difficult one for Argos’s staff here in Ireland as they get the news that the company will be closing down here.  ""Because Argos is shutting down its complete operation in Ireland this amounts to a collective redundancy which requires a 30-day consultation period and we know the company intends to honour that obligation to engage.  ""We will be using this period to negotiate the best possible terms for those who are losing their jobs and we are expecting a constructive response from the company.  Argos said in a statement that there will be ""no change"" to its stores in the rest of the UK as its stores in Northern Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales were ""performing well"".  Argos said it has over 1,000 ""points of presence"" across the UK which included 253 standalone stores and 422 Argos stores inside Sainsbury’s stores.

'I tested £6 thermals for two months - now I won't leave the house without them',"Mirror writer Amber O'Connor first tested the popular thermals back in November. Two months on, she loves the base layers and they've become a staple in her wardrobeIt's freezing in the UK right now, as I'm sure we can all agree. So, while everyone's on the hunt for the best warming products, I'd like to make a case for the humble base layer. Specifically, thermals. Following the cold weather alert issued on Monday , it remains vital to follow UKHSA's advice, such as heating your home and checking on vulnerable people. Thermals should never be used in place of following important safety advice. However, they can make a significant difference to how warm you feel if you're looking to stay extra cosy. I, for one, feel glad I've found a pair of thermals I love, as they've really helped this winter.   Last November, I was lucky enough to test a bargain set that cost just over a fiver per piece, and I've never looked back since. With the cold weather drawing in, I decided to try out Decathlon's cheapest Ski Base Layers. My reasoning was simple: if these products are designed for the ski slopes, they should help keep me warm inside and outside of my home. Retailing at £5.99 for the top and £5.99 for the trousers at the time (now £6.99 each) the total set came to a respectable £11.98. But even if I'd paid more, I'd still think the layers were very worthwhile investment. I was impressed by the products at the time, save for the length of the leggings on my long legs. But they've turned out to be even more useful than I could have known, since the winter days have closed in.  As someone who does not deal with the cold well, I kept wearing them after completing my first review - and here we are. Two months on, the thermals have become a staple in my wardrobe.  Whenever I know I'll be outside for most of the day, I make sure the set is freshly washed and ready to wear, as the garments make a real difference.  They've been everywhere, from the supermarket to the beach, during one windswept walk, and they were a welcome addition when I visited Winter Wonderland last month. Despite sub-zero temperatures, I happily walked around the outdoor fair wearing my thermals. In a bold move, I didn't even add a full-length layer over the leggings, instead wearing them under my skirt and knee-high boots. Black, form-fitting and comfortable, the products easily fit under top layers without adding bulk. Thanks to the quality, they can also be worn as they are, if you dare to brave the cold. Don't get me wrong, neither is a luxury product, but you can tell they been designed with functionality in mind. These are no-nonsense thermals, and you get what you expect from the stretchy knit and brushed interior.  Sure you can layer up with jumper after jumper, if you prefer. I certainly needed layers during my visit to Winter Wonderland. But I'm glad I had my thermals as well as my knitwear and coat.  They are cheap, wash well, and I've yet to find another set that's just as good for the price. Then again, I haven't been looking, as I love almost everything about this pair.

Lloyds Bank issues urgent scam warning with customers losing £642 in fraud,"A high-street banking chain has warned people to be vigilant when it comes to online shopping scams after a UK Finance Fraud Report revealed the average cost to victimsLloyds Bank has warned all customers to be aware of scams that are causing people to lose an average amount of £642 each. The banking chain is running a billboard campaign alerting people to beware of potential dangers when shopping online. Lloyds said that the average losses per person when falling for an online shopping scam is £642, citing figures from the 2021 UK Finance Fraud Report. The bank also offered advice on how to protect yourself while shopping on line, alongside the warning: ""Scams are changing every week.” Analysis showed that the number of consumers falling foul of online shopping scams had increased by 20% in December 2022.  Lloyds said certain goods are particularly risky, such as trainers, clothes, gaming consoles and phones, Liverpool Echo reported. Warning signs, Lloyds said, include:  The seller has recently joined the online platform There aren't any reviews or the reviews are bad You're being rushed into a bank transfer payment  Last month, Liz Ziegler, fraud prevention director at Lloyds Bank, told the Liverpool Echo: “Online shopping scams come in all shapes and sizes, but the vast majority start with items advertised on social media, where it’s too easy for fraudsters to use fake profiles and advertise goods that simply don’t exist.  “The safest way to pay for things online is always by debit or credit card, and buy from a trusted retailer. Remember that if a deal looks too good to be true, it usually is.” Last month Brits were warned to be on the look out for bank scams in 2023, with fraudsters taking advantage of the cost of living crisis to steal money. Online purchase scams were among the top five scams to be wary of, along with money mule requests – when people allow a criminal to use their bank to move stolen money - card theft, fake apps that target bank accounts and spoof calls or texts where fraudsters imitate legitimate companies, often banks.

The uplift to salaries, which followed discussions between Tesco Bank and both USDAW and Unite trade unions, is in addition to the bank’s annual pay review which will follow in May 2023. Tesco Bank Chief Executive, Gerry Mallon, said: “The rising cost of living is having an impact on households across the country, and we’ve been listening to colleagues about how this is affecting them.    ""That’s why we’ve taken action and awarded a permanent increase to base pay for the majority of our colleagues. “The salary increase aims to provide sustainable, long-term support to colleagues, including our contact centre colleagues who show great commitment to helping our customers in the current economic climate.” Tesco Bank is one of the latest UK businesses to give their staff an increase to their wage with fellow high street bank Natwest giving a £2,000 increase to over 39,000 of its UK staff on lower pay bands.   Natwest also provided a one-off payment of £1,000 for all employees in junior and junior management positions.  According to recent figures by the Office of National Statistics (ONS), the average pay in the UK rose by 6.4% between September and November 2022 compared to the year before. This was the fastest wage growth the UK has seen for over 20 years however, due to high inflation, which currently sits at 10.5%, wages fell in ""real terms"" by 2.6%.  The ONS figures also found that the gap between public and private sector pay was at a record high with private sector pay rising by 7.2% annually in the three months to November.  Compared to this, public sector pay only rose by 3% during the same period.  Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said the ""real value"" of people's pay was continuing to fall, with regular earnings dropping at the fastest rate since records began once inflation is taken into account.

Warning over change to MOT test that could see cars become 'death traps on wheels',"At the moment, drivers are required to put their vehicle through an MOT test every year but this could be set to increase to every two years - and from three years to four years for a new car needing its first MOTCars could become “death traps on wheels” if the annual MOT test is changed to every two years, the AA has warned.   At the moment, drivers are required to put their vehicle through an MOT test every year.  But under new plans, this could increase to every two years - and from three years to four years for a new car needing its first ever MOT. The test itself could also change too, with a greater focus on emissions and electric and hybrid car batteries. A consultation into the proposal - which would cover cars, vans and motorbikes - launched yesterday. However, motoring organisations have this week sounded the alarm over fears it could cause a huge increase in unsafe cars on the roads.   An MOT tests how safe a car is with parts checked including lights, seatbelts, tyres and brakes. Drivers who do not have a valid certificate can be fined up to £1,000. Edmund King, president of the AA, told This is Money: “If you move the MOT from every year to two years that means you would have an increase of death traps on wheels on the road because there would be no independent check on those cars. “And within two years, a driver doing 30,000 miles a year, it is very easy to have bald tyres and no brakes, and that's why the MOT is good.” RAC's head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes added: “While we're not opposed to delaying a new vehicle's first MOT, we believe there should be a requirement for particularly high mileage vehicles to be tested sooner. ”'If the Government is looking to improve the MOT, now is the ideal time to take into account how much a vehicle is driven alongside the number of years it's been on the road. “We're also disappointed the Government is still entertaining the idea of increasing the time between MOTs. Our research clearly shows drivers don't agree with this and believe it's dangerous.”  Eric Smith, MOT scheme manager at Kwik Fit said: ""We don’t believe there is good evidence to indicate that delaying a car’s first test beyond three years is a risk worth taking. ""In fact, the Government’s own forecasts show that delaying tests could lead to an increase in road casualties as well as a risk of more cars running with illegal emission levels. ""Of the vehicle defects listed as contributory factors to accidents, the Government data show that tyres are most common, and tyre condition is unrelated to vehicle age. ""Our experience shows that the annual check remains vital in not only improving the safety of our customers but also extending the life of their vehicles and reducing drivers’ overall maintenance costs.” The Department for Transport (DfT) argues that an annual MOT test is no longer needed due to advances in vehicle technology - and claims the change would collectively save drivers around £100million. But motoring groups have challenged this saving, and argued that delaying repairs could work out more costly in the long-run. The Mirror has contacted the Department for Transport for comment.

Mr Kipling owner Premier Foods to close UK factory putting 300 jobs at risk,"Premier Food announced the closure of the Staffordshire site, which largely makes unbranded powdered drinks for the group, in its recent trading updateThe company behind the Mr Kipling brand, Premier Foods, will be closing one of its UK manufacturing sites - putting 300 jobs at risk. The food giant is proposing to close its Knighton manufacturing site in Staffordshire, which it said was ""marginally"" loss-making. A consultation has been launched and will run until the middle of this year. The site in question, which largely makes unbranded powdered drinks for the group, is likely to continue operating into 2024 before finally shutting after a ""phased closure"". However, the group has not confirmed its plans for the closure of the site.  Announced in its most recent trading update, Premier Foods said the Knighton factory does not fit in with its ""branded growth model strategy and is marginally unprofitable at a trading profit"".    The group, which also makes sweet favourites such as Angel Delight and Bird's Custard, said: ""It is recognised that this will be an unsettling time for those circa 300 colleagues who are potentially affected by these proposals and they will be fully supported and consulted with throughout the process."" The move is set to cost it around £10 million in one-off closure costs, but Premier Food’s said the closure of the site will boost trading profits in the long run. Despite the announcement of the plan, Premiere Foods reported a 12% growth in group sales over the December period with its grocery sales up 17% and its branded item sales up 15%.  It said pricing provided a ""significant"" boost to revenue growth in the quarter, though it added that ""demand was particularly buoyant running into the key festive period"".  Premier Foods is not the only big brand to announce potential job losses in the recent few weeks as more businesses continue to struggle. Last week, the online retail giant Amazon announced that it was to shut three of its UK warehouses which was to put over 1,000 jobs at risk.  Another tech giant, Microsoft also recently announced around plans for 10,000 layoffs, which is just under 5% of its total workforce and would affect staff worldwide.  The casual dining burger chain Byron Burger also recently announced plans to close nine of its restaurants after falling into administration. In its announcement of the closures, Byron said the move was to affect around 218 jobs.  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/mr-kipling-owner-premier-foods-28995088
Millions of broadband and mobile customer face huge 14.4% bill rises - see full list,"Under current rules, telecom companies are allowed to increase prices mid-contract in line with inflation, plus roughly 4% extra on top of this - and that inflation figure was confirmed todayMillions of broadband and mobile customers will be hit by price hikes of up to 14.4% from this spring. Under current rules, telecom companies are allowed to increase prices mid-contract in line with inflation, plus roughly 4% extra on top of this. The rate of Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation for December or Retail Price Index (RPI) for January are normally used to decide these price rises. CPI inflation was today confirmed to be 10.5% for December and some companies will increase bills by this amount, plus an additional 3.9% on top. This means some bills will rise by up to 14.4%. But if you’re out of contract and you’re unhappy with the price rises, there are ways to lower your bill. We explain below. Here are all the major providers that have confirmed how much their bills are going up by - and when.    BT   BT has confirmed “the majority” of its broadband and landline customers will see prices rise by 14.4% (CPI plus 3.9%) from March 31, 2023.  This increase will also apply to all mobile and TV customers from the same date. The telecoms company said it is freezing prices for certain packages - including its BT Home Essentials, BT Basic and Home Phone Saver deals.  EE   If you’re an EE broadband, landline or mobile customer, your bill will also rise by 14.4% (CPI plus 3.9%).  This is because EE is owned by BT Group. These price rises will also come into effect from March 31, 2023. Anyone on the EE Mobile Basics or a pay-as-you go deal will see their prices frozen - so your bill won’t rise this year.   GiffGaff No price change announced today for mobile customers. O2  We don't know how much O2 will increase bills by yet. The rise will be based on the January Retail Price Index (RPI) figure which is released in February, plus 3.9% on top. If you're on an O2 Refresh package, the rise will only apply to the airtime part of your plan, so what you pay for calls, texts and data. It won't be included in what you pay for your device. Pay-as-you go customers won't see their bills rise.  Plusnet   Plusnet is also owned by BT Group - so prices for broadband, landline and mobile customers will go up by 14.4% (CPI plus 3.9%).  This will kick in from March 31, 2023. If you're a broadband and landline customer who signed up before October 7, 2020, the 14.4% increase will only apply to call costs. But when your contract expires, the increase will apply against your entire bill.   TalkTalk   TalkTalk broadband and landline customers will see their bills go up by 14.2% (CPI plus 3.7%) from April 1.   If you're a Fixed Price Plus customer who is out of their minimum contract period, your bill will rise by 10.5% in line with inflation.  TalkTalk says it will protect ""vulnerable"" customers from price rises by freezing the price of their current bill. Tesco No price change announced today for mobile customers.  Three  If you're a Three customer, how much your bill will rise by largely depends on when you took out a contract with the company.  Your bill will go up by 14.4% (CPI plus 3.9%) from April 1 for broadband and mobile customers who joined or upgraded from November 1, 2022.  Three said ""the majority"" of its contract customers will see bills increase by 4.5%. This applies to customers who joined between October 29, 2020 and October 21, 2022. Broadband and mobile users who signed up before October 29, 2020 and haven't upgraded will be subject to price rises in line with the January RPI figure.   Sky   Sky Mobile users who are out of contract will see their prices rise by an average of 9% from February 14.  The telecoms giant told The Mirror the average bill rise will be £1 a month - so £12 a year. If you're still in contract with Sky Mobile, your price won't change as Sky has a promise not to introduce mid-contract price rises. Sky told The Mirror it doesn't link increases to CPI and has not announced any bill hikes for broadband customers today.  Virgin  Virgin told The Mirror that all mobile customers will see their airtime plan increase by the January RPI rate plus 3.9% from April. This means you'll know how much your bill will go up by next month, when the January RPI figure is release. A spokesperson said no broadband changes have been announced today.  Vodafone  Vodafone hasn't announced any price changes today in line with CPI. In previous years, Vodafone has increases prices by a mixture of CPI and RPI figures depending on what product you've taken out. VOXI No price change announced today for mobile customers.   How to cut the cost of your broadband and mobile bill  If your mobile or broadband bill is about to get more expensive, you might be able to cut costs. If you're out of contract, you're free to leave and go elsewhere - or maybe you want to haggle down your current provider. There is also no harm in trying to haggle if you're still in contract. The first thing you should do, is compare prices elsewhere to see what other deals are available. You'll normally find SIM-only plans are the cheapest. You can compare prices by using comparison websites such as MoneySupermarket and Uswitch. Take a look at how many minutes, texts and how much data you currently use, so you can find similar plans that suit your needs. You may find you're actually paying too much right now for allowances that you're not using. When haggling, explain the better deals you've seen elsewhere then ask if the company can match or beat that price. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/millions-broadband-mobile-customer-face-28988139
Inflation dips to 10.5% but remains close to 40-year high - what it means for your money,"Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation fell to 10.5% in the 12 months to December - this is down from 10.7% in November and 11.1% in October when it hit a 41-year highUK inflation dipped to 10.5% in the 12 months to December as fuel prices fell - but the cost of living is still rising at one of the highest rates in 40 years. Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation was marginally down from 10.7% in the previous month of November - and has fallen further back from a 41-year high in October. Crucially, this doesn't mean prices are no longer rising - they are still going up, but just that little bit less sharply. Inflation is also still five times higher than the Bank of England target of 2% - meaning more interest rate rises could be on the cards. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said falling fuel prices helped lower CPI inflation, along with cheaper clothing and footwear.   Fuel prices rose by 11.5% in December 2022, down from 17.2% in the year to November. Prices of clothing and footwear rose by 6.4% overall during the same timeframe, easing from the 7.5% recorded in the previous month. But the price of restaurants and hotels, food and non-alcoholic beverages all continued to rise. Restaurants and hotels saw an 11.4% increase in December 2022, up from 10.2% in November. Food and non-alcoholic beverage prices rose by 16.9% - a further rise from 16.5% in the previous month.   Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, said: ""Inflation eased slightly in December, although still at a very high level, with overall prices rising strongly during the last year as a whole.  ""Prices at the pump fell notably in December, with the cost of clothing also dropping back slightly. ""However, this was offset by increases for coach and air fares as well as overnight hotel accommodation. Food costs continue to spike, with prices also rising in shops, cafes and restaurants."" Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt said: ""High inflation is a nightmare for family budgets, destroys business investment and leads to strike action, so however tough, we need to stick to our plan to bring it down.   ""While any fall in inflation is welcome, we have a plan to go further and halve inflation this year, reduce debt and grow the economy - but it is vital that we take the difficult decisions needed and see the plan through.""  Inflation figures are released each month by the ONS to show how the prices of everyday goods and services have changed over a 12-month period.  For example, if something cost £1 a year ago and the rate of inflation is 2%, it would now cost £1.02 today. When inflation is higher, you're paying more so something compare to one year ago - so your money doesn't stretch as far as it used to. At its highest point in recent months, inflation stood at a 41-year high of 11.1% in the 12 months to October.   Why is inflation so high?  The soaring cost of energy - triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and high demand after Covid - is a key reason why inflation is so high.  The typical household saw their energy bill shoot up to £1,971 in April last year.  Bills were then due to rise to £3,549 in October but the Energy Price Guarantee was brought in instead.  The Energy Price Guarantee has “frozen” energy bills for the average family at £2,500 - although this isn't a total cap on your bills.  You can still pay more or less than this, as what is actually capped is the unit rates for gas and electricity used. The Energy Price Guarantee will rise in April 2023 to £3,000 for the typical household.  The price of food has also risen dramatically this year - meaning we're all paying more in the supermarkets.  Annual food inflation hit 16.5% in November, the ONS said, the highest rate for 45 years.  The war in Ukraine has had a knock-on effect on what we pay in the supermarkets here in the UK, as this has pushed up the cost of animal feed, fertiliser and oil.  Retailers are also being hit by higher energy costs and rising wages, with this being passed down to customers.   Why is inflation a worry?  When inflation is high, it means you're able to buy less for the same amount of cash. This is particularly bad when inflation outstrips wage growth, as you need to use a higher percentage of your money to buy everyday essentials. Higher inflation also means the Bank of England will likely keep putting up interest rates. This means millions of mortgage deals and borrowing rates become more expensive.  Will inflation keep falling this year?  The Bank of England forecast in November forecast CPI inflation would drop to around 5% by the end of 2023. But of course, no one knows for sure what will happen to prices over the next year.  This week, the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said UK inflation could fall rapidly following a drop in global energy prices.  Wholesale gas prices have fallen in recent weeks thanks to milder weather and high levels of gas storage. Mr Bailey told MPs on the Commons Treasury committee: ""The biggest single reason inflation has risen to that level is the war in Ukraine. ""It is also the most likely reason that we’re going to see a rapid fall in inflation in the year ahead, because we are not seeing energy prices rising further. In fact, they’re coming down."" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has vowed to halve inflation ""by the end of the year"" as one of his five visions for Britain.   How is inflation linked to interest rates?  The Bank of England is trying to lower inflation by raising interest rates. Its base rate - which influences the rates banks charge you as a customer to borrow money - is currently at a 14-year high of 3.5% The idea behind raising interest rates is that households will spend less and this should mean inflation will drop. Financial markets expect the Bank to increase its base rate from 3.5% to 4% on February 2.  What can you do to tackle rising inflation?  When inflation is high, it is important you take stock of your money and make sure it is working as hard as possible for you. For example, any savings you have should be in high-paying account. Savings rates have been creeping up - although slowly. The top-paying easy access account currently pays 2.9% or you can get up to 4.56% fixed. Keep in mind if you fix for a long time, you won't benefit from any potential future rate rises. If you've a lot of investments, you might want to consider diversifying your portfolio with a mix of assets - but do your research first and seek proper advice. Another thing you should be doing is reassessing what you're buying.  See if you can save money in the supermarkets and take a good look through your bank account too and see if they are any bills you can lower.

Full list of biggest price rises from food to eating out as inflation falls to 10.5%,"Although it has reduced, the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) rate of inflation still remains at one of the highest levels in 40 years as the cost of living crisis continuesInflation in the UK has slightly eased going from 10.7% to 10.5% in the 12 months to December 2022. The fall in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was in line with city forecasts however, is still more than five times the Bank of England’s target of 2%. Although it has reduced, the CPI figure still remains at one of the highest levels in 40 years as the cost of living crisis continues, with a peak of 11.1% recorded in October. Alongside the inflation announcement, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed the main driving forces behind the latest inflation figures. Prices were higher prices in restaurants and hotels, as well as food and non-alcoholic beverages. But it said falling fuel prices helped lower the CPI inflation figure, along with cheaper clothing and footwear.   What is rising in price the most? Here is how prices are changing, according to the ONS:  Housing and household services: (+26.6%) Food and non-alcoholic beverages: (+16.8%) Restaurants and hotels: (+11.3%) Furniture and household goods: (+9.8%) Transport: (+6.5%) Clothing and footwear: (+6.5%) Miscellaneous goods and services: (+5.4%) Health: (+5.1%) Recreation and culture: (+4.9%) Alcohol and tobacco: (+3.7%) Education: (+3.2%) Communication: (+2.0%)  Inflation figures are released each month by the ONS to show how the prices of everyday goods and services have changed over a 12-month period. So, if something cost £1 a year ago and the rate of inflation was 2%, then it would now cost £1.02.  When inflation is high, it means you're able to buy less for the same amount of cash which causes problems when inflation outstrips wage growth.  Food inflation, which is still rising at the fastest pace in recent memory, is piling monumental pressure on households which are also being squeezed by rising interest rates and elevated energy bills.  Supermarkets in the UK have notably increased the price of their products over the last year with recent research by Which? revealing that budget items rose by 20.3% on average in December compared to the same month a year before.  Supermarkets’ luxury ranges also rose 12.6% and the price of branded items went up 12.5%. Campaigners have warned that higher budget prices hit poorer households the hardest because it means more of their take-home income goes on essential food and there aren’t cheaper options. The rising cost of food to shoppers is because making and transporting that food costs more which means supermarkets have to pay more to get the food they sell to the public, and that cost is being passed on. These rising costs, which include energy bills, animal feed and transport expenses, are also effecting restaurants and hotels with the extra costs again being passed over to the consumer.

Martin Lewis explains 'snowball' trick to clear debt and pay off what you owe,"Martin Lewis returned to TV screens again and tonight's episode tackles the subject of debt and the Money Saving Expert shared how you could clear all your debt by following the technique of 'snowballing'On his money show tonight, Martin Lewis shared his tips on the ""important technique"" called ""snowballing"" which he says could help you clear larger debts sooner. The Money Saving Expert explained how if you have more than one debt, then you should try and ""repay the right way"" by using the ""snowballing method"".  The debt snowball method is a debt-reduction strategy where you pay off the debt in order of smallest to largest, gaining momentum as you knock out each remaining balance.  Martin says the first thing you should do is line them all up in order of the highest interest rate from high to low, which he says will be the overdraft for many.   Once you have done this, you should then ""shift"" all your ""spare cash"" you possibly have or can have towards paying the highest interest rate debt first, you should then pay off the minimum payment on all the others. Martin reiterated that you don't need to pay all of these debts equally and you do not need to pay the biggest debt first. Instead, he said you really should focus on paying the highest annual percentage rate (APR) first as this is the debt that is growing the quickest, which in turn will be the most expensive. Once you have cleared this debt, then you can work on paying off the second one and so on. By approaching your debts this way, Martin says you can ""get rid of your debt more quickly"".  He added: ""Of course within all of this, try not to borrow anymore as that is going to make life more difficult.""   The Money Saving Expert noted that to be able to pay these debts, you will need to make yourself a budget and try to stick to it, as you will need to be able to cover the debt payments each month.  Martin then explained how debts were not something you had in isolation, but something that you build up due to spending elsewhere and you should try and pay them off where you could, by using savings if need be.  After this section of his show, the Money Saving Expert noted that during this cost of living crisis, there is a lot of ""peer pressure"" to spend.   He said: ""If you're struggling, I would be open about it. Tell people you're in debt. Tell people you can't afford it and can't afford to go to dinner with you.  ""I can't afford to go to the pub and have a round I just need to stay in myself and everybody else. Let's accept that honestly, and not put pressure on people to spend when they don't have the cash."" Throughout the show, the Money Saving Expert reiterated that if you were struggling with debts, as several viewers wrote in to say they were, then you should reach out for help if you felt like you were not coping.  Help can be found at charities such as StepChange Debt Charity, Citizen's Advice, and National Debtline.  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/martin-lewis-explains-snowball-trick-28980946

British Gas to give thousands of customers free £250 credit to help with energy bills,"British Gas says it will identify those who are eligible for the free help - meaning you shouldn’t need to apply - as it launches a new £10million support packageBritish Gas is to give thousands of prepayment customers free £250 in energy credit to help pay their bills. The money will be rewarded to those who are struggling with energy costs, which have risen astronomically over the last year. British Gas says it will identify those who are eligible for it - meaning you shouldn’t need to apply for the help. It comes as part of a new £10million support package announced by the energy giant today to help prepayment customers. Prepay meters are often installed when a household falls behind on their bills - but they’re more expensive than paying by direct debit.   As part of its extra support, British Gas says it will ban forced remote switches to prepay meters this winter, unless a customer asks for one. The UK’s biggest energy provider will also run extra vulnerability checks and will install smart prepay meters so customers having issues can be identified quickly.  The new help from British Gas comes after worrying research from Citizens Advice showed 3.2 million people ran out of credit last year because they couldn’t afford to top up their meter.  This figure equates to around one household cut-off every 10 seconds, said Citizens Advice - with more than two million people having been disconnected at least once a month. In particular, the charity is the most concerned about disabled people and those living with long-term health conditions.  Chris O’Shea, Chief Executive of Centrica, parent company of British Gas said: “We know that some prepayment customers are self-disconnecting and not coming forward for help, so we have reviewed our policies to do more to target support at this group. “As a responsible business we are doing all we can to support our customers during this crisis – our work with the British Gas Energy Trust provides grants and money advice services. “As well as helping our customers with much needed cash grants, I’m really proud of how our teams are giving expert advice and support at this busy time to help guide people through this crisis. “Our call centres are helping around a million energy customers each month with their bills and our engineers are in homes every day advising customers on how to be more energy efficient and make savings.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/british-gas-give-thousands-customers-28983720
Aldi is giving thousands of workers a pay rise - see how its hourly rate is changing,"Following two pay increases for hourly-paid warehouse colleagues in 2022, this further rise means colleagues will be paid up to 20% more than at this time last yearAldi is increasing its pay rates for around 7,000 warehouse workers across the UK from February 2023. The budget supermarket's warehouse workers will begin to be paid £13.13 an hour, up from the £11.48 they currently earn now.  This is the third increase since the beginning of last year.  The move follows Aldi’s recent pay review for its store assistants, which came into effect this month, and saw Aldi staff receive an hourly wage of £11.90 nationally, and £12.75, within the M25. The new wages offered to both Aldi's store assistants and warehouse staff exceed the Living Wage Foundations' recommended hourly wage of £10.90.    Giles Hurley, chief executive officer of Aldi UK and Ireland, said: “Just as we promise our customers that we will do all we can to support them, we are equally committed to supporting our amazing Aldi colleagues – as we remain the highest-paying supermarket in the UK. “This announcement recognises the hard work and contribution our colleagues make in serving communities across the country and it’s down to them that we are able to ensure our customers can access fresh affordable food, every single day.” Wages at Aldi have been raised by more than 15% in the last year and the supermarket's commitment to paying staff more has even led to it being named employer of the year in 2022 by The Grocer Magazine.  It is the first UK supermarket to pay a minimum of £11 per hour to all store assistants. The budget supermarket also says it is currently the only supermarket to offer paid breaks, which is worth an additional £871 a year for the average store colleague. Currently, the supermarket has around 457 sites across the UK with seven distribution centres and over 9,000 employees.  Aldi's popularity has increased significantly over the last few years for its cheaper-than-average groceries, particularly during the current cost of living crisis which has seen consumers' finances squeezed significantly.  Aldi was also recently crowned the cheapest supermarket of 2022 by the consumer champion Which? after offering the lowest priced for seven consecutive months, from June to December.  Aldi's fellow german-chain Lidl was the cheapest for five months, from January to May. According to Which? in December a basket of 48 groceries cost £81.63 on average at Aldi - while Lidl shoppers paid £83.24. This was significantly cheaper than other popular supermarkets whose average cost for the same basket ranged from £93 all the way up to £113.

Supermarket basics soar by 30% as shoppers feel the squeeze - see full list of rises,"The huge increase was highlighted in the Which? inflation tracker, which shows how prices have changed at Aldi, Asda, Lidl, Morrisons, Ocado, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and WaitroseSupermarket basics soared in price by up to 30% on a yearly basis last month - as worrying research shows how shoppers are feeling the squeeze in stores.  The huge increase was highlighted in the Which? inflation tracker, which reveals how prices have changed at Aldi, Asda, Lidl, Morrisons, Ocado, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Waitrose.  Across the eight retailers, butters and spreads went up an eye-watering 29.4%. Milk prices rose by 26.3% and cheese was up 22.3% during the same period. The tracker - which looked at tens of thousands of food and drink products across three months - shows overall food and drink inflation in December was at 15%. It comes as overall Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation was this morning confirmed to have dipped slightly from 10.7% to 10.5% in the 12 months to December. The worst individual price hike noted by the Which? track was Quaker Oat So Simple Simply Apple (8x33g) at Asda which shot up a staggering 188% from £1 in December 2021 to £2.88 in December 2022.   Utterly Butterly (500g) rose 95% from £1 to £1.95 at Waitrose, while one pint of Waitrose Duchy Organic Homogenised Semi-Skimmed Milk (568ml) increased 87.1% from 65p to £1.22. Tesco Creamfields French Brie 200G went up in price by 81.59% from 79p to £1.43. Budget and own-brand items again went up at a faster rate - 20.3% and 18.5% respectively - compared to premium and branded counterparts - up 12.6% and 12.5%.   Lidl prices went up the most at 21.1% in December, followed closely by Aldi at 20.8% - although Which? says both supermarkets are still cheaper overall compared to other stores.  Asda had the third highest inflation where prices rose 15.4%. Inflation rose slightly less at Waitrose at 14.5%, followed by Sainsbury’s on 13.7%, Tesco at 13.1%, Morrisons on 12.9% and Ocado with 10.5%. Supermarket shoppers have told Which? of their dismay over how fast prices are rising.  One participant, a man in his late 30s from the South East, told Which?: “The cost of food from supermarkets is close to unmanageable for many people, including myself. “Given that large supermarkets make huge profits, I feel they could keep their prices down while we struggle with the cost of living.” A 43-year-old woman from Yorkshire and Humberside said supermarkets “don’t care about the consumer and charge whatever they can to make as much profit as possible.”  Sue Davies, Which? Head of Food Policy, said: “We know food prices have risen exponentially in the last year and our inflation tracker shows the dramatic impact this is having on everyday products at the supermarket. “Some households are already skipping meals to make ends meet and our findings show trust in supermarkets taking a hit as many people worry they are putting profits before the people suffering during this cost of living crisis. “Supermarkets must do more, Which? is calling for them to ensure everyone has easy access to basic, affordable food ranges at a store near them, particularly in areas where people are most in need.“  A spokesperson for Asda said: ""We have a long-standing reputation for providing customers with outstanding value and it’s more important than ever that we deliver on this for them. ""We’re focused on keeping prices on branded and own-label products in check to ensure that Asda remains the lowest-priced traditional supermarket as shown by independent research carried out by Which? Magazine.”  A Waitrose spokesperson said: ""With the increase in production costs for primary products and the war in Ukraine, no retailer is immune to inflation, however our overall price inflation is much lower than the examples selected, which have been impacted disproportionately.  ""We’re working very hard with our suppliers to ensure we offer great value, while continuing to deliver industry-leading animal welfare standards, fresh produce grown with care and fair deals for farmers."" A spokesperson for Morrisons said: ""We are working hard to keep prices down and competitive for our customers while maintaining high standards and availability in all our stores. ""Since December we have invested over £16 million to cut the prices on over 50% of our entry level products to help customers' money go further."" An Aldi spokesperson said: ""We are the lowest-priced supermarket in Britain. Our customers will always pay less for their shop with Aldi and that is why Which? has named us as the cheapest supermarket in 2022.  ""Value is the number one consideration for most households and our promise to our customers is that we will always provide the lowest grocery prices in Britain.""

Barclays to shut 15 more banks this year - see full list of affected branches,"The latest closures comes on top of 11 sites already earmarked by Barclays in 2023 - taking the total number of banks set to close their doors for good this year to 26Barclays has announced plans to shut 15 more bank branches this year. It comes on top of 11 sites already earmarked for closure in 2023 - taking the total number of Barclays banks closing their doors for good to 26. Barclays will shut the newly listed 15 bank branches in April 2023. You can see a full list of affected sites below. If you're a Barclays customer and you're worried about your local bank shutting, you do have options if you need in-person support. Barclays runs a support van and pop-up banks where you can get help and advice on certain days each month.  You can check Barclays website to see the latest dates for both the van and bank pop-ups.   Barclays customers can also access certain facilities at Post Office branches including cash and cheque deposits, checking your balance and withdrawing cash. A Barclays spokesperson said: “Our customers’ behaviour has changed significantly in recent years, with the majority choosing online banking. As we adapt, we are closing less well used branches whilst investing in brilliant customer service and digital technology.  “We are maintaining our community presence with alternative options for customers who still require in-person support. This includes our network of Barclays Local sites in libraries and community centres, bank pods and mobile vans, our cashback without purchase service, Shared Banking Hubs and everyday banking at the Post Office.” Banks up and down the country have been shutting their doors due to more customers shopping online - and Barclays isn't alone in closing branches. HSBC has said it will shutter 114 banks - around a quarter of its total sites - in 2023.  Lloyds is closing a further 14 banks next year, while NatWest currently has 43 scheduled to shut forever.

Paperchase set to appoint administrators as it continues search for new buyer,"It is unclear how many stores and jobs might be put at risk with the possible administration processPaperchase has put administrators on standby as the stationary chain continues to search for a rescue deal.  The retailer has lined up the corporate restructuring firm Begbies Traynor as the administrator in the event of talks for a backer collapsing. It is unclear how many stores and jobs could potentially be put at risk by another administration process.  There are currently 101 Paperchase stores in the UK and Ireland.  This is the second time within the last two years that the retailer has been on the brink of administration with the first notice to appoint administrators having been made in January 2021.    The near collapse of the chain was due to Covid-19 after it saw sales slide on the back of significantly lower footfall amid the coronavirus lockdown restrictions. The accountancy firm PwC was appointed as the administrator at the time and Paperchase managed to secure a rescue deal with the newly-formed company Aspen Phoenix Newco, which was backed by Permira Debt Managers.  The pre-pack administration deal meant the stationary firm was able to save around 1,000 jobs when the newly formed company Aspen Phoenix Newco, which is backed by Permira Debt Managers, took control of the firm. However, around 270 jobs were reported to be lost as the firm had to permanently close 27 of its sites.  At the time, the company employed 1,278 staff across its store portfolio, head office function and distribution centre. Sky News first reported ""city sources"" said Paperchase was continuing to seek a solvent rescue deal, and Begbies' prospective role represented ""sensible contingency planning"" in the event one did not materialise. These sources also said another pre-pack administration deal was likely.  Paperchase was taken over in August last year by the retail entrepreneur Steve Curtis who was backed by Retail Realisation, an industry advisory firm with which Curtis was affiliated with. Sky News reported earlier this month that Paperchase had been again put up for sale again just a few months after the recent change in ownership.  It was reported that the sale, which was being handled by PWC, was set to be completed in the coming few weeks with some sources saying that an insolvency process may be required to ""expedite"" a transaction.  Paperchase told Mirror Money: ""We confirm that we have retained BTG and PWC to advise Paperchase on strategic options, including the sale of the business as a going concern to new owners. Talks are continuing with a number of interested parties. ""All Paperchase stores and the website will continue to trade as normal during this period. We can’t comment further on this process until discussions with interested parties have been concluded."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/paperchase-set-appoint-administrators-continues-28975394
Interview mistake easily made as soon as you leave home that could cost you the job,"A few business owners give their top tips for nailing a job interview - from start to finish - including how to be memorable and why prepping small talk countsNew year, new you... new job? In the spirit of new beginnings, many workers will be looking for a career change or new role in 2023 - and with endless applications comes the possibility of landing an interview or two. Everyone knows how daunting and nerve-wracking they can be, and there are some theories that suggest hiring managers make their decision within the first 15 seconds of meeting you, while some interviewees can also fail the 'coffee cup test'.  Now, one business owner has warned that some people can make a big interview mistake from the moment they shut their front door and start their journey into the office or place of work.   Thankfully, along with being as prepared as you can be, knowing about these faux pas along with other tips and tricks could potentially help you land your dream job.  Here, a few business owners, who often find themselves on interview panels, share their advice with Diamond Interiors to set you on the path of the perfect job interview, from start to finish. It starts before you get there  Every interview starts long before the first handshake, the experts say.  You never know who you might sit next to on the bus, or stand behind in the coffee shop queue - anyone could be your interviewer. So always be sure to project a friendly, professional and confident air from the moment you step out your front door. Of course, you've already prepared to arrive early. Not on time, early. Make sure the receptionist knows you're there, have a chat, turn off your phone and take note of your surroundings - it may make for good small talk topics later. Resist the urge to cram in some last-minute prep, the experts add. You don't want to come across as flustered or under-prepared, but rather organised and calm. First impressions count  Stating the obvious? Maybe. But never underestimate the importance of establishing a real connection, and putting across the best version of yourself, the professionals say. Make eye contact, smile, give off positive body language, give a good handshake, and be enthusiastic. Be yourself, but also the best version of yourself. After all, everyone wants to work with people they like, so use this to your advantage. Nick Politt, managing director of Diamond Interiors, says you only have mere minutes to show your best side: ""It's not unheard of for hiring decisions to be decided a few minutes into the interview.  ""First impressions are difficult to change; people form opinions and stick to them. So you always need to put your best foot forward.  ""Personally I like to see a smile, a firm handshake, and a little bit of chat before the more formal part begins, rather than a silent walk to the boardroom. Make that connection and impression straight away, and make it the very best you can."" Prep for small talk  Small talk always comes first and, love it or hate it, there's really no way around it.  Getting your small talk right can make or break the interview. It's how we build rapport and affinity and can be the first clue for your potential employers of whether you have the right 'chemistry'. Part of small talk is undoubtedly being able to think on your feet and improvise, but you can still do a little prep work beforehand to keep the conversation flowing smoothly. Claire Crompton, commercial director of digital marketing agency The Audit Lab, says she often hires for culture over everything else: ""Unless you're hiring for a senior or highly technical role, it's becoming more important than ever to hire for culture first.  ""If a person doesn't have the right personality for your business, then they won't fit in with the team around them, and quality and productivity is likely to suffer.  ""This can work really well when you're hiring for junior positions or straight out of uni - pretty much any skill can be taught - but if you're hiring further up the ladder, then patience and perseverance are required to get the balance right."" Be memorable Unfortunately, interviewers often don't remember much about every person they speak to - a downside of speaking to multiple candidates for one position.  To jog personal memories, you may be referred to as ""The Runner"" or ""The Cat Person"" - so make yourself memorable; as soon as someone says ""The Crossfit Guy"", someone else immediately says ""Oh yeah! Them! They were good!"" So, what makes a good hook? The experts suggest clothing or personal style; an unusual fact about you; an outside interest; a past job. Hooks are memorable, and they create an anchor for people to remember you by. And never underestimate the power of being memorable, they say.  Jessica Morgan, owner of Carnsight Communications, prefers to take an informal approach to her interviews: ""I don't like putting people on the spot.  ""I believe people are at their best when they feel comfortable - that's when they really deliver. I want to see what they can offer and I want to see a glimpse into the real person – so I try to make people feel at ease during an interview. ""It helps if they're talking about their achievements and things they know about - at work but also their hobbies. I've actually just been on a WhatsApp chat with someone I interviewed 20 years ago for a role.  ""The thing that stands out from that interview was his passion for talking about running a radio show at university. He came alive and I saw a bit of the real him and hiring him was one of the best decisions I made in that role."" Have you got a unique interview theory you'd like to share?

Millions on benefits to miss out on £720 in backdated payments after court ruling,"Four benefit claimants took the DWP to the High Court in November 2021 arguing that it was ""unfair"" to exclude legacy benefit claimants from the £20 Universal Credit uplift during the Covid-19 pandemicAround two million benefit claimants have missed out on back payments worth £720 after the High Court dismissed an appeal against the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Four legacy benefit claimants took the DWP to the High Court to claim it was unfair that those on older benefits missed out on the £20 weekly uplift given to those claiming Universal Credit during the Covid pandemic.  In November 2021, the four claimants lost the case but were later allowed to appeal the decision with the appeal hearing taking place on December 7, 2022. The four claimants wanted to DWP to backpay the amount that they didn't receive during the pandemic and in the appeal in December, they asked for payments of £720.    This is based on the £20 a week for 36 weeks or nine months. The original claim wanted back payments worth £1,560 for the entire 18 months, however, this was shortened at the last appeal.  However, there was never a guarantee that the back payments would be given if the claimants were successful.  Today, the High Court upheld the ruling made in the original hearing which was held in February 2022. The four claimants, who were represented by William Ford of Osbornes Law, Jamie Burton QC of Doughty Street Chambers and Desmond Rutledge of Garden Court Chambers, argued that the decision by the DWP was ""discriminatory contrary to Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights"". This is because those with disabilities were more likely to be claiming the older legacy benefits or Personal Independence Payments (PIP) instead of Universal Credit. Two of the Claimants in the case were in receipt of Employment Support Allowance (ESA) and the third and fourth were in receipt of Jobseekers’ Allowance and Income Support.  In today's verdict, the Court of Appeal judges accepted the DWP’s claim that the £20 uplift was not intended to alleviate hardship but to reduce the financial shock to the newly unemployed and prevent them from becoming dependent on benefits in the long term. Read More
 The court accepted that the uplift was paid “in recognition of the fact that sudden, short-term unemployment can trigger social and health problems, leading to dependence on welfare, and hampering a return to employment.” The court went on to find that: “The uplift was not targeted at alleviating hardship as a result of increased costs during the pandemic.  ""It was targeted at alleviating a particular type of financial disruption, namely that experienced by those who had lost or were at risk of losing employment or significant income, and who as a result were making new claims for social security benefits for the first time having previously been financially self-sufficient.” It also ruled that legacy benefits claimants were not a priority for help because they were “either not in the labour market at all by virtue of their disabilities, or only to a limited extent"".   The judge added: ""That does not mean they were not a deserving group, and they were undoubtedly vulnerable. Nonetheless, a hard choice was made to prioritise those in the labour market but who it was anticipated would quickly become unemployed as a direct consequence of the pandemic and the lockdown measures that followed, and do so in large numbers.” The court documents also noted that the decisions in the case ""involved complex social and political judgments and difficult socio-economic choices"" which were only introduced as a temporary measure to address the situation which was ""regarded as a national emergency"". However, the judge again recognised, as it did in the previous hearing, that amounts paid to legacy benefits claimants during the pandemic were low and it was ""obvious that any person required to rely on that level of income would suffer hardship and would find it more difficult to meet basic living expenses during the pandemic"". William Ford, the solicitor who represented the claimants said: ""I appreciate that this outcome will be a great disappointment to many people on legacy benefits who have been waiting patiently for this judgment.  ""All possible effort was made to persuade the Court of Appeal to reach a different outcome and it is deeply disappointing that this did not prove possible.""  A DWP spokesperson said: “We welcome the Court of Appeal’s findings in our favour. It has always been the case that claimants on legacy benefits can make a claim for Universal Credit if they believe they will be better off.” Osbornes Law told Mirror Money their legal team were considering the judgement and looking at their options.

Sky is hiking prices by 9% for 1.3million customers next month - how to cut costs,"Roughly 1.3million Sky Mobile customers who are out of contract will see their bill go up from February 14 as a result of the increase - Sky says is writing to anyone who will be affected.Sky Mobile customers who are out of contract will see the price of their phone bill rise by an average of 9% in a few weeks' time. “The majority” of its tariffs will increase by £1 a month, with the price rise kicking in from February 14. Roughly 1.3million customers will see their price go up as a result and Sky says is writing to anyone who will be affected. The first payments following the price increase will be taken on February 17. This means if your payment date is before February 17, the increase will show on your next bill. If you’re still in contract, the price you pay won’t change. This is because Sky has a promise not to bring in mid-contract price rises for mobile customers.   A Sky Mobile spokesperson said: ""This is not a decision we have taken lightly. ""We try to provide our customers with as much value as possible which is why our data plans have not increased in price for five years. ""However due to increased cost pressures the majority of our mobile tariffs are increasing by £1, with the average percentage increase being below levels of inflation."" How to save money on your mobile bill If you're not happy with the price rise, there are options available. The first thing you should do, is compare prices elsewhere to see what other deals are available. You'll normally find SIM-only plans are the cheapest. You can compare prices by using comparison websites such as MoneySupermarket and Uswitch.  Take a look at how many minutes, texts and how much data you currently use, so you can find similar plans that suit your needs. You may find you're actually paying too much right now for allowances that you're not using. Once you've found all the best deals available to you, you can either switch to another provider - or try and haggle down Sky. When haggling, explain the better deals you've seen elsewhere then ask if the company can match or beat that price. Always be polite when trying to negotiate a better deal. As well as lowering your mobile bill, you should also compare and haggle down your broadband bill before March. Many telecom firms are set to hike bills by the rate of Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation or Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation, plus roughly another 4% on top.

"Supermarkets raised prices of almost 10,000 products right after Christmas","Apparently, price rises by supermarkets just after Christmas are not ""uncommon"" but the number of increases seen this year is almost double than what is expectedBritish supermarkets have upped the prices of nearly 10,000 products in the weekly directly after Christmas, new analysis has revealed. Price rises after the festive period are not “uncommon” as supermarket chains have usually spent several weeks trying to keep prices steady in the lead-up to Christmas. However, this year’s increase, noted by the retail data firm Assosia for The Grocer, was seen as being “unusually“ large. Altogether, around 9,763 products, from 156,555 grocery-based products, were subject to price rises across the UK’s major grocery chains between Boxing Day and January 6. This was slightly higher than the 9,103 product price rises recorded in January 2022.   The Grocer Magazine reported that normally shoppers could expect to see only about 5,000 price increases at this time of year. According to the report, Asda lead the way with price rises having upped the price of around 2,470 products which is around 11% of its entire range.  However, Asda had lowered the prices of around 734 products meaning overall 1,736 items are now more expensive than before. Morrisons took second place having upped the prices of £1,585 of its products and Sainsbury's took third place with a price increase of around 1,329 products.  Although, both supermarkets did reduce the price of a few hundred products taking their increase figure to 1,032 and 1,007 respectively or 8% and 5% of their entire range.    According to this data, Tesco had upped the least with just 741 products, or 3% of its range seeing a price increase.  The UK's favourite discount supermarket Aldi, which was named the UK's cheapest supermarket by Which? in 2022, increased prices on 6% of its range, while Lidl, who received second place, did so on 7% of products. Amongst the categories, drinks saw the biggest price rises with 11% of the range seeing a rise. According to the Grocer, this figure was higher among certain alcoholic drinks, 23% of beer and cider, 15% for spirits, and 7% for wine. Cupboard essentials and frozen food saw an overall increase of 7%, whilst the cost of fresh food saw a 5% rise.  The products with the lowest amount of increases were health and beauty where only 3% of its range saw a rise and baby, which had only 4% of its range upped. In response to the findings, Asda said in a statement that it is “consistently named the lowest-priced traditional supermarket in independent price comparison surveys carried out by Which? and The Grocer”. It added: ""There are a number of reasons why grocery prices vary over time and during this period we also reduced prices on thousands of products.” A Tesco spokesperson said: “With household budgets under increasing pressure we are absolutely committed to helping our customers, by keeping a laser focus on the cost of the weekly shop. We are therefore pleased to be recognised as the retailer doing the most to keep prices down right now. “So whether it’s price matching Aldi on the basics, locking the price of more than a thousand household staples until Easter 2023, or offering exclusive deals and rewards through thousands of Clubcard Prices – we’re more committed than ever to providing our customers with great value.” Morrisons said it was ""working hard to keep prices down"" whilst ""maintaining high standards"" in their stores.  It added: ""Since December we have invested over £16 million to cut the prices on over 50% of our entry-level products to help customers' money go further, particularly during the January squeeze."" The Mirror has contacted Sainsbury's, Aldi and Lidl for comment. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/supermarkets-raised-prices-almost-10000-28965449
Money expert explains 4 things you're paying too much money for - and how to fix it,"Consumer rights expert Martyn James runs through all the ways you can cut your costs and save money - as he highlights everything you're probably paying too much forWith costs rising in all aspects of our lives, it’s easy to assume that we just have to accept a world of higher prices. But did you know that many of the expenses we assume are non-negotiable are actually a big rip-off and you can save a fortune by switching, cutting back or shopping around? Here’s my guide to some of the main services you’re paying for that are likely to be too expensive – and how to save some cash or escape your contracts. I’d love to hear from readers about the big financial rip-offs you’ve encountered. So get in touch and share your stories.    Insurance  One of the biggest overcharging scandals in the last few decades was the insurance ""loyalty charge"". This is where insurers increased the premiums of their customers who stayed loyal each year, often leading to vastly inflated costs. The Financial Conduct Authority effectively banned this practice, with the new rules kicking in last year – but only for home and car insurance, on the understanding that loyalty charges would also be phased out in other insurance contracts. However, loads of readers are telling me that their insurance costs are still increasing each year. But there are ways you can beat this and save a packet. For a start, are you paying for policies you don’t need? When you buy a new phone or upgrade, chances are the business will try to sell you a new mobile phone insurance policy. If you assumed that the old policy would be cancelled, you may be in for a nasty surprise. Though it should be obvious to businesses that you don’t need your old policy any more, they often don’t remind you to cancel. If you’re being charged for old insurance policies you don’t need, not only can you cancel them, you can ask for the money to be refunded too, with interest. I’d also recommend consolidating all of your insurance policies for your gadgets in to one. You may be paying separate policies for your phone, tablet, laptop, gaming console and smart devices, at £10 to £15 or more a pop. If you get a multi-gadget policy for five items, it could cut your costs for £20 to £30 a month down from £150 a month. That’s over £600 a year!   Broadband  It’s estimated by regulator Ofcom that over 7 million people were ""out of contract"" with their broadband deals. Annoyingly, people who are out of contract are generally paying much more for their broadband package than new customers. Once again, there’s a high price for staying loyal, so if you’ve been out of contract for a few years then you’ll have had annual above inflation price rises stuck on your monthly payments. It’s not unheard of for people to be paying upwards of £100 a month for their broadband and TV packages. You can easily cut your costs in half, or get your payments down as low as £20 if you are happy to go for a basic package. There are also new, super low deals for people in receipt of benefits, though you do have to ask to go on to these. One of the biggest blockers when it comes to switching broadband providers is the fear of something going wrong and being left without vital communications tools. I recently put my money where my mouth is and switched. Though not everything went smoothly, there was an overlap period of a month where both my old provider and new one was operating, which meant I could alternate while a few teething problems were sorted out. A word of warning though - remember to ask about price rises in April 2023. Regardless what the business says, their contracts allow them to hike the amount you pay. The current rate of inflation is 10.7%. If you add on 3% and add that to your proposed new monthly payments, you’ll have a clearer picture of what the price rise might be in a few months, though inflation could change quite a bit before April. You usually get better deals if you sign up for longer periods, but that could be a false economy if you can’t afford the prices rises as exit fees can be unbelievably high if you want to leave a contract early. So have a think about whether it makes more sense to sign up to a more expensive deal that only lasts 12 months, particularly if you think you might move or change jobs in the next few years.   Overdrafts  What’s the most expensive form of borrowing? Well, there are a range of borrowing options to watch out for:   High interest, short term loans : Or payday loans, in a new form. These forms of lending operate in the same way as payday loans, just running for longer periods. The interest has come down a little but is still really high.   Doorstep lending : This is illegal, but evidence suggests that doorstep lending is increasing once more. Speak to Citizens Advice if you are stuck with one of these loans.   Credit cards : Credit card interest rates are creeping up at the moment, having crossed the 20% APR boundary a few years ago. However, high risk customers can routinely face interest charges of 30% or more, which makes this form of borrowing dangerous for those on limited incomes.   Yet surprisingly, the humble agreed overdraft has become one of the most expensive ways to borrow money with rates starting around 20% and hitting 40% or more. Overdrafts have proved to be controversial recently after the banks were effectively banned from overcharging people who slipped in to the red.  So now, you’ll be charged for using your existing , agreed overdraft.   These new overdraft fees often are added by the day and compound interest can apply, which means debt interest is added to your total debt – then you then pay subsequent interest on the whole sum.  So the longer you are in an agreed overdraft, the more you will pay. The way this is worked out is enormously complicated, so now is the time to get out of your overdraft once and for all if you can. Try reducing it by £50 a month or speak to your bank for their suggestions on reducing costs.   Subscriptions  From magazines to gym memberships, we waste thousands of pounds each year on subscriptions we don’t want or need. So be honest with yourself. What can you ditch? Ditching a gym membership alone can save you £300 or more a year depending on where you go. There’s also loads of cheap gym equipment for the home on resale websites after everyone’s pandemic health kicks faded. Subscriptions are crafty because they’re often low value, so you might not think too much of a £7.99 debit, but that works out to just under £100 a year. Yet this is where we spend hundreds, if not thousands of pounds each year. Take streaming services, for example. You might have signed up to watch a film on an extra channel on the service, yet after a seven-day trial, you could be paying an extra fiver a month. These charges are often hidden as they appear only through bills from you main streaming service. Virtual services are easy to miss because they exist in digital form. We often agree to pay a little extra to store data on ""the cloud"". Yet because we can sign up to cloud storage when we buy laptops, phones, tablets, anti-virus software, and anything linked to the internet, chances are you’re paying for more than one service – which you don’t need. The same goes for music streaming. Did you get nudged in to paying for YouTube or Spotify ad free? Was Apple Music the easiest way to listen? Pick one streaming service and settle for adverts.

Supermarket expert shares little-known shelf 'trap' that makes you spend more in shop,"A consumer psychologist has shared her thoughts on some of the little-known tricks used in supermarkets that make you want to shop for longer and buy more - including product placement and music choicesMany of us will have nipped to the supermarket to grab a few basics like milk or toothpaste and ended up heading home with a basket, or even a trolley full of items we didn't necessarily need. You might have convinced yourself the purchases were helpful and will save you from going back again to the shop later that week, or you might have just cursed your impulsive spending habits and moved on. But an expert has claimed that it's more likely than not that you were being influenced by your surroundings and the supermarket had used subtle psychological tricks to try and get you to shop for longer and thus spend more money.  Consumer psychologist Dr. Cathrine Jansson-Boyd has shared some of the sneaky ways supermarkets do this with The Mirror, and many people probably won't have realised they'd played into the tricks.    Dr. Jansson-Boyd begins by explaining how the layout of supermarkets are designed to ""trap"" people in the hopes they'll buy more things.  ""It's no fluke that you have to walk up and down long aisles in the supermarket,"" she says. ""They do that to make sure that you're trapped, because the more time you spend in an aisle, the more likely you are to pick up things along the way that you wouldn't otherwise buy if you could whisk through the shop in any direction."" The expert goes on to explain how the placement of products on the shelves can also impact how much you spend, with many stores encouraging shoppers to opt for pricier items by putting them at a certain height on the shelves. She claims they will often put more expensive, branded items at eye level and place cheaper items lower down towards the floor.   ""Supermarkets tend to want to make as much profit as possible,"" she explains. ""If we walk down aisle after aisle we tend not to want to scan up and down because it's a bombardment of stimuli and that's exhausting if you do it continuously. ""So we are often just looking at eye height which is about both consumers 135 centimetres from the floor. We're then more likely to pick up what's right in front of us as it's more convenient.  ""Therefore by putting the most expensive stuff at this level, supermarkets can maximise their profits."" Another common way the aisles are used to encourage people to buy more is through end-of-aisle offers. Dr. Jannson Boyd claims that ""nine out of 10 times"" shoppers will pick something up from the end of the aisle display as they are shown to be special offers and nabbing a bargain can give us an ""adrenaline rush"" and make us feel good about ourselves.   If this weren't enough, she tells how supermarkets will also move their stock around every six months to a year to stop customers from becoming overly familiar with the layout of the store. This means that shoppers will have to walk around more to find what they need, instead of breezing straight to the aisle they'd expect to find it in.  ""They tend to move things around. If you go to a supermarket regularly, there will come a point where you'll walk in and you're like, 'hang on a minute, I knew the bread was down here...' but it's not there. ""It's not to frustrate customers, because of course, they want people to be happy, it's to ensure you have to walk around looking and you'll pick up more things along the way. There's a real relationship between the length of time spent in a supermarket and number of products purchased."" Other tricks supermarkets use include playing music at Christmas to make your shopping experience seem more cheerful and festive and pumping out artificial scents into the store, such as the smell of fresh bread around the bakery. The latter is the most ""traditional trick of all"", Dr. Jannson-Boyd says, going on to add how it evokes a feeling of nostalgia for many of us. ""It's so often an artificial scent because it doesn't smell in the bakery as often the bread is pre-manufactured but they still pump out a smell of fresh bread, as shoppers have childhood associations with the smell. ""It's homely, it's nice and it's fresh. You want to believe that everything in the store is made from scratch and is amazing, but of course, it isn't. However, we sniff it and we're quite easily duped, we buy into it and we think it's all very fresh."" Do you have an expert story to share? We want to hear all about it.

Primark launches new deal that will save shoppers money - but only for next two weeks,"Primark has slashed the minimum price you need to spend on its click and collect service but the offer is only available for the next two weeks so you will need to be quick to take advantage of the offerPrimark has reduced the minimum spend of its click and collect service from £15 to £5 for the next two weeks. This means shoppers only need to spend a fiver to use the service throughout the rest of this month, with the offer set to end on Tuesday, January 31. With limited time to claim the savings deal, Primark fans will need to be quick in order to take advantage of the offer which allows them to spend a lot less then they normally need to use the service, Of course, you can save more money by just shopping in stores as normal - but the deal is good for those who want to try out click and collect. Primark currently offers click and collect service exclusively at 25 of its stores across the North West of England, Yorkshire and North Wales.   The service allows shoppers to browse and purchase certain items online, and then pick them up at a dedicated counter at a Primark store. The only items which can be bought online through Primark's click and collect service are the chain's kids' toys, clothing and nursery ranges. This means you have to have to head to your local branch to get your womenswear, menswear and homeware. Primark does not charge a fee for its service but normally needs shoppers to spend at least £15 to qualify for it.  Fans of Primark have called on the retailer to introduce an online shop for years, particularly since the Covid-19 pandemic when all its shops were forced to close because of the national lockdown.  When it introduced the service last year, the service was so popular that it crashed shortly after going live as it faced bigger than-expected demand.   Even with its popularity, Primark is reluctant to fully convert into an e-Commerce site with Primark's owner, Associated British Foods’ CEO George Weston, telling the Financial Times that the retailer “is and always has been a high street retailer” and the transition into home delivery across its entire range was simply not going to happen.  One of the reasons for the introduction of the click-and-collect service was to give shoppers who lived near smaller Primark outlets a chance to browse the retailer's entire range.  The full list of stores currently offering the click-and-collect service include:  Birkenhead, Grange Road, CH41 6EA  Blackburn, The Mall Blackburn, BB1 7JG  Blackpool, Bank Hey Street, FY1 4RY  Bolton, Crompton Place Shopping, BL1 1EA  Broughton, Broughton Shopping Park, CH4 0DE  Burnley, Charter Walk Shopping Centre, BB11 1BB  Bury, The Rock Shopping Centre, BL9 0ND  Carlisle, English Street, CA3 8NX  Chester, Foregate Street, CH1 1HA  Huddersfield, New Street, HD1 2TR  Lancaster, Marketgate Shopping Centre, LA1 1JF  Liverpool, Church Street, L1 3AY  Llandudno, Parc Llandudno Retail Park, LL30 1PX  Manchester, Market Street, M1 1WA  Manchester, The Trafford Centre, M17 8AS  Oldham, Market Place, OL1 3AB  Preston, Fishergate Shopping Centre, PR1 8HJ  Sheffield, Meadowhall, S9 1ER  Sheffield, The Moor, S1 4PA  Southport, Chapel Street, PR8 1AE  Stockport, Chestergate, SK1 1NT  Wallasey, Cherry Tree Shopping Centre, CH44 5TL  Warrington, Golden Square, WA1 1QB  Wigan, Standishgate, WN1 1UP  Wrexham, Regent Street, LL11 1RY  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/primark-launches-new-deal-save-28973550
DWP issues new scam warning for those receiving £301 cost of living payments,"Ahead of the second round of Cost of Living payments, the DWP has started to share warnings about scammers looking to take advantage of the help that is being given outThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has issued a new scam warning to millions who are due to receive a Cost of Living payment over the coming months. In November last year, the Government revealed that a second round of cost-of-living payments was going to be given to more than eight million households This spring, the first part of the £900 means-tested cost of living payment worth £301 will start to be paid out. The DWP recently took to social media to spread its warning of scammers who will take advantage of the cost of living crisis by targeting those who do not know how the payments are made.   In posts shared on both Twitter and Facebook, the DWP reminded people that if they are eligible for a payment, they do not need to apply for it as the money will arrive in their bank account automatically. You should receive your payment in the same way you usually get your benefit or tax credits.  The Government says this includes if you’re found to be eligible for a Cost of Living Payment or a Disability Cost of Living Payment at a later date. The department also warned that they will never ask for personal details in a text message or an email.  In its post, the DWP said: ""DWP tweeted: “Watch out for scammers targeting people about #CostOfLiving Payments “If you're eligible   You do not need to apply for the payment  You do not need to call us  Payment to you is automatic  We will never ask for personal details by SMS or email.”  The new warning reiterated the guidance on the official Cost of Living Payments page on GOV.UK.   This guidance added: “If you have had a message asking you to apply or contact someone about the payment, this might be a scam.” If you receive a text message like this, the DWP advises you forward it to 7726 in order to report the scam.  It is completely free to do and simply reports the message to your mobile phone provider. If you receive a suspicious email, then you should forward it to report@phishing.gov.uk and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) will investigate it.    The new round of Cost of Living payments, which includes payments for those who are disabled and are older, will provide financial help to certain households during the current period of high inflation the UK is seeing.  The Government has yet to release the exact details on the eligibility criteria for the payments, although it is likely to be the same criteria as last year's payments, as well as codes you should look out for in your bank statement. These are expected to be announced closer to the time.  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/dwp-issues-new-scam-warning-28967753

Marks and Spencer to open 20 new stores across UK - see list of confirmed sites,"Some of the shopping centres where M&S will open new stores will include the Birmingham Bullring and the Trafford Centre in Manchester - both of which will be converted from old Debenhams sitesMarks and Spencer has announced plans to open 20 new stores across the UK in a move that will create 3,400 jobs. The posh supermarket will open eight full-line stores, selling both food and clothing, along with 12 new food halls. Some of the new sites will be located in shopping centres, including the Birmingham Bullring, Trafford Centre in Manchester, Leeds White Rose, Liverpool ONE and Lakeside Thurrock. All five of these new full-line stores will be converted from old Debenhams sites. The new openings will see M&S invest £480million in new stores and comes under a wider restructure of its business. But these plans mean some existing shops will close for good, as M&S looks to focus on its food-only outlets.   M&S last year revealed it would reduce the number of its full-line stores by 67 to 180 over the following five financial years. However, it will open 104 more Simply Food shops - taking the total number of its food-only sites from 316 to 420. M&S is aiming to save £309million in rent costs through this huge business shake-up. Stuart Machin, chief executive of M&S said: “Stores are a core part of M&S’s omni-channel future and serve as a competitive advantage for how customers want to shop today. “Our store rotation programme is about making sure we have the right stores, in the right space and we're aiming to rotate from the 247 stores we have today to 180 higher quality, higher productivity full line stores that sell our full Clothing, Home and Food offer whilst also opening over 100 bigger, better food sites.”  The first of the new shops confirmed so far are:  Purley Way (expected Summer 2023) Leeds White Rose (expected Summer 2023) Liverpool (expected Summer 2023) Birmingham Bullring (Autumn 2023) Lakeside Thurrock (Winter 2023) Trafford Centre (Winter 2023) Stockport (expected Summer 2023) Barnsley (expected Autumn 2023) Largs (expected Winter 2023)   In its latest Christmas trading update, M&S said fashion and home sales were 37.7% up in the 13 weeks to 1 January at just over £1billion when compared to the same period last year. Food sales were 10% up on a 12-month basis at £1.9billion, with this figure boosted by a tie-up with Ocado. It now expected full-year profit before tax and adjusted items to be at least £500million.

Royal Mail warns customers NOT to send parcels abroad after cyber attack,"Royal Mail has today asked customers to refrain from sending items to overseas destinations until further notice as it tries to address a ""cyber incident""Royal Mail has asked customers to not send items abroad until ""further notice"" following a cyber attack. The delivery giant said it is continuing to experience ""severe service disruption"" following a ""cyber incident"" - however, the group has not provided further details on the issue. In a statement, Royal Mail said: ""To support faster recovery when our service is restored and to prevent a build-up of export items in our network, we're asking customers not to post international items until further notice. ""Items that have already been dispatched may be subject to delays."" The National Cyber Security Centre has said it's aware of the incident.   The group first announced it had been affected by a cyber attack last week. The area affected by the cyber incident was the back office system which is used by Royal Mail to prepare mail for being sent abroad and to track and trace overseas items. In its statement, Royal Mail said it was temporarily unable to despatch export items, including letters and parcels to overseas destinations. Last week, people were told to ""avoid"" posting any items abroad while the problem is tackled. When Royal Mail reported the news, it described the incident as a ""cyber-incident"" rather than an attack as the group did not know what had caused the problem.  It also said it had ""immediately"" launched an investigation into the incident and were working with its external partners.   However, it was later reported by news outlets that the incident had been an attack by a ""ransomware gang"" who reportedly have close links to Russia. The Telegraph reported that printers at the Northern Irish Royal Mail distribution centre had begun ""spurting"" out copies of a ransom note.  The ransom note has been reported by the Telegraph as saying: """"Lockbit Black Ransomware. Your data are [sic] stolen and encrypted. ""You can contact us and decrypt one file for free.""  The ransom group has also reportedly threatened to publish stolen data on the dark web.  Royal Mail declined to comment on this at the time of the report.  With Royal Mail asking customers to not send items using the overseas delivery service for the ""foreseeable,"" it is unclear how long the disruption will go on.  Royal Mail is able to send items overseas to around 220 countries across the world, and in the year until March 2022, it sent around 152 million international parcels. This equated to around 200,000 items a day and amounted to one-tenth of total parcel volumes. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/breaking-royal-mail-warns-customers-28964341
Beer prices to rise TODAY with brands including Heineken and Strongbow going up,"Heineken confirmed it would raise prices in an update last year, with the brewery to start charging 15.8% more per keg on average from today (January 16) in what spells bad news for pubs and puntersHeineken is raising its beer and cider prices from today with brands including Fosters and Strongbow set to be affected. The hike will also hit other Heineken brands such as Amstel, Birra Moretti and Old Mout. Heineken confirmed it would raise prices in an update last year, with the brewery to start charging 15.8% more per keg on average from today (January 16). The brewery blamed the move on “unprecedented cost increases” hitting its business. It comes amid a backdrop of soaring inflation and higher energy costs. The rise could hit drinkers if businesses choose to pass on the wholesale price rise on.   If they do, then drinkers face paying more for pints and bottles sold in the pub, as well as bottled and canned beers sold in supermarkets. Heineken has also announced a new keg surcharge for the popular Birra Moretti brand at £1.20 per 50 litre kegs and £0.84 per 30 litre kegs.  A spokesperson for Heineken said: ""Like many UK manufacturers, Heineken UK is facing unprecedented cost increases on a number of critical inputs used to make beer and cider. ""This is predominantly driven by the significant rise in energy prices, which is also having a dramatic impact on the costs of other goods including glass, aluminium and malted barley. “Whilst we have undertaken initiatives to increase our efficiency and reduce cost volatility, the scale of these input cost increases means we have no choice but to change the wholesale price of our products to our customers. “We appreciate these are challenging times, and we are committed to working with our customers to support a strong and sustainable category going forward.”   On top of the price increase, Heineken is also reducing the alcohol content in Fosters from 4% to 3.7%.  It claims this is because more of its customers are choosing a ""healthy lifestyle."" The new lower alcohol by volume (ABV) Fosters will come into circulation in the UK from January 23 for draught products and February 13 for packaged products. A spokesperson said: “We know consumers are increasingly choosing lower abv beers and ciders as part of a healthy lifestyle.  ""Reducing the alcohol content of one of our highest volume brands will also help remove millions of alcohol units across the UK, aligned to our long-held position of promoting moderation.""

"Mum saves £3,800 on new kitchen with £300 bargain - and 'couldn't believe her luck'","Instead of forking out £5,000 for the installation of a new kitchen, one mum decided to be a little thrifty which helped her save nearly £4,000The cost to install a new kitchen isn't cheap and can cost a few thousand, however, one savvy DIY-er has managed to bag herself a new kitchen for the cost of just £300. Rachel Poolton, who runs Inch Go Lipo, was quoted over £5,000 for the installation of a new kitchen for her home and instead of forking out the cash, she decided to be a little thrifty instead. The mum of two from Cardiff, who is always taking on small DIY projects in her home, made the decision to buy herself a second-hand kitchen which she then installed entirely herself. This decision gave Rachel not only the new kitchen she wanted but also helped her save thousands.   The idea of buying a second hand kitchen came to Rachel when she was browsing Facebook Marketplace after she saw the high quality of the used items being sold.   She said: ""Loads of people moving into old homes and updating them to their taste and offering the existing kitchens for bargain prices, I knew it would save me thousands."" ‘I bought a complete used kitchen for just £300 which included the integrated dishwasher, fridge freezer and ovens. I couldn't believe my luck!  ""I also got the wall and floor cupboards as well as integrated housing units for the fridge and other white goods, I also purchased all of the worktops and baseboards, too. I knew I bought a lot more than I needed, but for that price, it was a complete bargain."" Rachel then paid a local man with a van £50 to drop it at a storage unit until she was ready to renovate.  The thrifty mum then picked up some stick tiles to use as flooring, which were on offer at the time for 14 tiles for £10 from Dunelm, waterproof drawer liners for £3.99 from B&M Bargains, and sticky-back plastic for the worktops which cost £6 a roll on eBay.   Rachel was kitted out with a drill, freezer bags, and a sharpie when she arrived at the property to pick up her new kitchen.  She said: “I labelled every door that came off and stored every item's nails and screws in individual freezer bags and handwrote what piece of the kitchen it came from. It saved loads of time when I tried to fit the individual items into my kitchen when they'd all been moved around loads."" When ready to assemble her kitchen, Rachel said it took a bit of time and effort as she had to jiggle the pieces around a bit to get them all to fit. She added: ""The challenges along the way were dealing with the uneven old walls and floors, as my house is an older build. If I had to do it again the only thing I would change is to plaster the walls to get a flush finish. However, the haggling with the spirit level and packing to make everything flush is part of the fun!""  On top of this, Rachel purchased a few added extras such as new blinds, dried flowers, and a new microwave, kitchen and toaster.  Rachel wanted the design for her kitchen to be matte black which after researching the style, she decided to pair with natural warm wood tones finishes and tones.  The lipo specialist says she is ""so in love"" with the final result of her ""new to her"" kitchen and says her clients are always complimentary of the space she has created.  Rachel says overall, with the cost of the kitchen units, the flooring, the worktop and all the added extras she spent around £1,200 which gave her a saving of around £3,800 when compared to the quoted cost she originally got.

Sainsbury's announces huge change that affects deliveries - it's good news for shoppers,"From the end of February, Sainsbury's shoppers near 175 stores will be able to order their everyday groceries through the Just Eat app and have them delivered in 30 minutesSainsbury's has teamed up with online meal ordering and delivery firm Just Eat in a bid to add faster home delivery for its groceries across the country. Under the deal, customers will be able to order everything from fresh milk and vegetables to household essentials through the Just Eat app.  Just Eat will then have a rider collect their order and deliver it within half an hour. The big four supermarket said there will be more than 3,000 products available for delivery from 175 of its stores nationwide by the end of February. The new delivery partnership will be offered to those living in areas such as London, Edinburgh and Bristol.   Sainsbury’s and Just Eat say that it hopes the partnership will expand to other locations before the end of the year. Sainsbury’s already offers its own Chop Chop fast delivery service and has partnerships with Deliveroo and Uber Eats and the partnership is a big addition to Just Eat’s growing grocery offering. Just Eat already has partnership deals with Asda, wholesaler Booker which is part of market leader Tesco, and the bakery chain Greggs. Just Eat has said that on-demand grocery deliveries are growing in popularity around the world and that it is committed to expanding its grocery options. Grocery deliveries such as this have grown rapidly since the Covid-19 pandemic, and other grocery-specific delivery businesses, such as Getir and Gorillas have become common sights in the UK, especially within the capital.  Amy Heather, director of strategic accounts at Just Eat said: ""Just Eat's grocery offering is going from strength to strength and continues to be an area of significant focus."" ""We're excited to be working with Sainsbury's to bring even more choice and flexibility to our customers when ordering the food and products they want, when they want.""  Siobhan McMullan-Finnegan-Dehn, director of eCommerce at Sainsbury's, said: ""We are always on the lookout for more ways to make our customers' lives easier and we look forward to working with Just Eat and to serving more shoppers with even more great value and quality Sainsbury's products.""  In the recent Which? supermarket price review, Sainbury's took fifth place in the consumer group's roundup of cheapest supermarkets in 2022.  In December, the average cost of a basket of 48 groceries at Sainbury's cost on average £95.71. while at Aldi the same basket cost an average of £81.63.  With convenience being a major factor in deciding where you go to buy your food, and not just price, Sainsbury's new step could help entice shoppers back after Sainsbury’s said it's online grocery sales were down 10% over Christmas.

Sky customers to get easier access to cheaper broadband - and it could save you £180,"Sky has joined the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) Social Tariff scheme, which makes it easier to identity people on benefits and give them access to cheaper broadbandSky customers on low incomes will get easier access to cheaper broadband after the telecoms giant signed up to a new Government scheme.   The TV, mobile and internet provider has joined the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) Social Tariff scheme, which makes it easier to identity people on benefits  Many companies offer cheaper broadband deals, known as social tariffs, for people on low-incomes - but customers have to prove their entitlement, sometimes as often as every month. The Social Tariff scheme means people do not need to keep showing they are in receipt of benefits. Introduced last summer, the scheme lets internet service providers – with customers’ permission – ask the DWP whether they are claiming benefits.   Sky and its subsidiary brand NOW are the only national providers currently signed up and live with scheme, although another provider called WightFibre piloted the checker last year. The Government claims switching to a social tariff could save you up to £180 a year - but many people don't realise these deals exist. Prices start from £12 a month with Vodafone - but you might also be able to get six months free if you're a jobseeker through TalkTalk.  Sky and NOW offer a social broadband tariff that costs £20 a month. See the full list of social tariff providers below. Minister for Social Mobility, Youth and Progression Mims Davies said: “It’s positive to see a major provider, such as Sky, sign up to our scheme, making it easier for families to access cheaper broadband and mobile tariffs in difficult times, and I call on other providers to follow suit in offering this type of tariff for those in need. “Claimants who think they might be eligible for one of these tariffs, should contact their provider. “This is just one of the ways we are working to help households during these tough times as part of the government’s £37billion support package for those most in need. “Do use the DWP benefits calculator, which is a helpful tool for those looking to see if they could access wider support.” Stephen van Rooyen, Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer, Sky, UK & Europe, said: “We know how important connectivity is to our customers, which is why we are focussed on ways we can support them to stay online. “As well as support with bills, we also provide existing, eligible customers with a broadband and mobile social tariff, helping them stay connected for a significantly reduced cost. “The Department for Work and Pensions eligibility tool is a useful step forward, enabling us to more easily confirm eligibility.”   Full list of all the 'social tariffs'  As well as ""social tariffs"" normally being cheaper than standard deals, they also normally don't come with any exit fees. It is worth checking what is available in your area. If you're interested in one of the below tariffs, visit the main company website to check the eligibility criteria.

All the Universal Credit and benefit changes coming in 2023 - and how they affect you,"A whole raft of changes to the benefits system is set to come over the next 12 months and if you are claiming a DWP benefit then you should be aware of what they areEvery new year brings changes and this year is no exception - and there are quite a few changes set to come throughout 2023 for the UK's benefits system.  Last year, a lot of changes were announced by the multiple Tory cabinets we saw, which will impact a wide variety of Department for Work and Pension (DWP) benefits, with a particular focus on Universal Credit.  If you claim a particular benefit, you will need to be aware of the changes which are expected over the next year. To help you keep on top of it all, Mirror Money has compiled a complete list of what is set to happen and when they will take place.   Changes to how many hours you need to work This month, the Administrative Earnings Threshold (AET) of Universal Credit will be raised to a higher level which will mean more people will have to actively look for work whilst claiming.  At the end of September 2022, the AET was raised to the equivalent of 12 hours on the National Living Wage, at £494 per calendar month for single claimants and £782 per calendar month for couples. From January 30, 2023, the threshold will be raised to 15 hours on National Living Wage, making it £617 for single people and £988 for couples. People earning below this threshold will be placed in an intensive work search group where they face more pressure from job centre staff to boost their pay. With the threshold raised, the Government says that an additional 120,000 people will be moved into the intensive work search group.  Benefits to rise in April Most benefits including Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment (PIP), the state pension and the benefit cap will be uprated by 10.1%. The full list of benefits which will see an increase in payment from April include:   Universal Credit Housing benefit Pension Credit Attendance Allowance Constant Attendance Allowance  Carer's Allowance Disability Living Allowance  Employment Support Allowance Jobseekers Allowance Maternity, paternity, adoption and shared parental pay Maternity Allowance Income Support Personal Independence Payment State Pension Widows Benefit Severe Disablement Allowance Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Industrial Death Benefit Incapacity benefits Bereavement Benefit   The Universal Credit standard allowance will increase from: Under 25:  2022-23 - single person - £265.31 2023-24 - single persons - £292.11   2022-23 - joint claimants - £416.45 2023-24 - joint claimants - £458.51  Over 25  2022-23 - single person - £334.91 2023-24 - single person - £368.74   2022-23 - joint claimants - £525.72 2023-24 - joint claimants - £578.82  Benefit Cap  Annual cap for couples and families in Greater London - Increasing from £23,000 to £25,323 (Monthly equivalent: £1,916.67 to £2,110.25)  Annual cap for single adults in Greater London - Increasing from £15,410 to £16,967 (Monthly equivalent: £1,284.17 to £1,413.92)  Annual cap for couples and families in the rest of the country - Increasing from £20,000 to £22,020 (Monthly equivalent: £1,667.67 to £1,835)  Annual cap for single adults in the rest of the country - Increasing from £13,400 to £14,753 (Monthly equivalent: £1,116.67 to £1,229.42)  The full list of how much each benefit will be rising can be found on the Government's website.  State pension triple lock back in place The state pension will rise by 10.1% after the return of the triple lock was confirmed by the Tories. The triple lock promise guarantees the state pension rises by the highest of average earnings, CPI inflation and 2.5%. But this was downgraded to a double lock to avoid a record 8% increase after the pandemic pushed earnings growth higher as workers returned from furlough. Now the triple lock guarantee is being kept in place, the full state pension will rise from £185.15 to £203.85 per week. The basic state pension will increase from £141.85 per week to £156.20 per week under the triple lock.  Cold Weather Payments replaced in Scotland Beginning in February, Scotland will replace the Cold Weather Payment in Scotland with a new benefit called the Winter Heating Payment. The Scottish Government says if you’re currently eligible for Cold Weather Payment from the DWP and your circumstances have not changed, you’ll be eligible for a Winter Heating payment. Unlike the UK Government's Cold Weather Payment, the Scottish benefit will not be dependent on how cold it gets - instead, it will offer all eligible households an annual payment of £50 to help with energy bills.  Changes to child Disability Living Allowance in Scotland The Scottish Government intends to have transferred all recipients of child Disability Living Allowance (DLA) to Scottish Child Disability Payment by spring 2023. The Government will also introduce changes to the rules for the Support for Mortgage Interest (SMI) help, this is a loan to help pay the interest on your mortgage or other home loans for those on certain benefits.  The changes will see the waiting period reduced from 9 months to 3 months and there are no changes to the zero earnings rules.   More pressure to meet with work coach People on Universal Credit who work 15 to 35 hours a week for minimum wage will be required to meet a work coach to increase their hours or earnings. The Government says this change will affect 600,000 Universal Credit claimants, and says it is part of plans to encourage people into better paid work. This was one of a flurry of welfare announcements in the Autumn Statement back in November 2021. Switch to Scottish Carer's Allowance The Scottish Government has been working towards delivering a new benefit that will start to replace Carer’s Allowance by the end of this year, with a full roll out expected for Spring 2024. The benefit will be called Scottish Carer's Assistance and the Scottish Government says it will provide a ""improved service"" for Scottish carers. The benefit will continue to provide the extra £245.70 Carer's Allowance Supplement payments twice a year, and will increase the monthly payment by around 13%.  More people moved over to Universal Credit The DWP intends to continue its process of moving people on ""legacy benefits"" onto Universal Credit.  The Government says the process, which is called a ""managed migration"", was restarted in November 2022 after a brief hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic and is set to be completed by 2026.  There is an exception for people who get Employment and Support Allowance and do not get Tax Credits as they will be moved onto Universal Credit in 2028. This was confirmed in the Chancellor's Autumn Statement last year. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/full-list-universal-credit-benefit-28946035
Tinned food giant Heinz faces backlash after hiking baked beans price by 21p,"Retail experts warn the food giant could lose out as shoppers go for cheaper supermarket beans. Heinz blamed the rising price of ingredients, energy and packagingTinned food giant Heinz is facing a backlash after hiking the price of its baked beans. Britain’s leading brand has put a 415g tin up by 20p in the last year to an average £1.41 – but at least one chain is charging £1.70. Retail experts warn the food giant could lose out as shoppers go for cheaper supermarket beans.  Independent analyst Richard Hyman said: “If the gap gets too big they’ll lose sales.”  One shopper tweeted: “Heinz baked beans £1.70 in #Tesco today. Disgusting for a tin of a beans.”  Another wrote: “HeinzUK You’re an absolute disgrace. Why aren’t you ashamed?” Mr Hyman said costs had been severely affected by inflation at 14%.   But he added: “If you lose sales by inflating prices too far, will you make more profit? It’s a tough call.”  Meanwhile supermarkets have kept own-brand prices lower. Tesco’s 420g tin is up 50% in a year, but still just 50p.  Morrisons still charges 39p for its 410g tin, the same as in 2021, according to price site trolley.co.uk.   A Kraft Heinz spokesperson said: “Like the rest of the food industry, we continue to face significantly increased production costs – whether it’s ingredients, energy, or packaging – and rising inflation.  ""We’re absorbing costs wherever we can however we've unfortunately had to increase our prices to retailers – a measure that continues to remain a last resort. “To offset some of the pressures consumers are facing, we’re working collaboratively with retailers to offer great value through regular promotions and promotional cycles across a range of our products.  ""We’ve adapted our offer to consumers with different pack sizes, value ranges and lower price points. We are also continuing to look for efficiencies in our operations.” Lou Ellerton, of analyst Kantar, said: “The beans come from North America, so they’ve got transport, UK inflation, plus the drop of the pound against the dollar. “It’s a pretty vicious combination.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/tinned-food-giant-heinz-faces-28954256
Energy bills predicted to FALL further this year as price of gas tumbles,"Finance firm Investec predicts the Ofgem price cap on energy bills could fall to £3,317 in April, then £2,478 in July and £2,546 in October - this would be lower than the Energy Price GuaranteeEnergy bills could fall further than previously forecast this year, in what would be welcome news for struggling households.  Finance firm Investec predicts the Ofgem price cap on energy bills could fall to £3,317 in April, then £2,478 in July and £2,546 in October.  The price cap is currently set at £4,279 for someone with typical energy use, having risen on January 1 from £3,549. But no one currently pays this. At the moment, families are covered by the Energy Price Guarantee which has “frozen” the typical bill at £2,500. This will rise in April to £3,000 but the new predictions from Investec could mean that the typical call falls below this from July.   Of course, these are just guesses - no one know for sure just yet how energy prices will fluctuate over the next few weeks and months. The new predictions are lower than figures released by energy consultancy Cornwall Insight earlier this month, who said the typical annual bill could fall to £2,800 in the summer. However, bills remain far higher than before the start of the energy crisis in 2021, when households were typically paying £1,277. The lower price cap forecast is linked to a drop in the price of wholesale gas.  The price of gas rocketed after Russia invaded Ukraine last year but wholesale costs have now fallen to pre-war levels due to warmer weather in Europe and higher levels of storage.    The term “price cap” when speaking about energy is often confusing as there isn’t actually a total cap on what you can pay for gas and electricity. Instead, both the price cap and Energy Price Guarantee set a limit on the unit rates you can be charged for gas and electricity and the standing charges. The £2,500 figure via the Energy Price Guarantee is just used to illustrate how much the typical household will pay Your energy bill depends on how much gas and electricity you use, where you live, and your supplier.  If you're worried about paying for energy, we've rounded up all the help available - included grants worth up to £1,500.  Lowering your energy consumption has been touted as the best way to slash your bill, by doing simple things like turning lights off when you leave a room and unplugging ""vampire"" appliances.

Byron Burger to shut nine UK restaurants - see full list of branches,"Byron Burger announces it will close nine of its burger restaurants after falling into administration with the closures causing over 200 people to lose their jobThe owner of Byron Burger has said it will permanently shut nine restaurants after falling into administration. Famously Proper, which owns Byron and fried chicken brand Mother Clucker, currently has 21 casual dining restaurants across the UK, however, the closure will see only 12 continue to trade.  With 12 restaurants remaining open, around 365 jobs have been saved, however, as a result of the closures, 218 jobs will have to be cut.  The administrators from Interpath Advisory said they would provide support to those impacted by the redundancies as a ""matter of priority"". The company was set up after the Mayfair-based private equity firm Calveton rescued Byron from a previous administration in 2020 following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.   The administrators were appointed on Friday and immediately confirmed the company has been sold in a pre-pack administration to Tristar Foods, a new company linked to Calveton. Interpath Advisory said the company had faced ""significant challenges"" over the last 12 months which were driven by rising costs, principally food and utilities, together with a reduction in customer spending as a result of the current cost-of-living crisis. It said: ""Following an exploration of a number of options to safeguard the future of the business, no solvent offers were forthcoming, and the directors took the difficult decision to file for the appointment of administrators."" Alongside this, Byron, like many other hospitality venues was hit hard by rising inflation throughout 2022.   Claire Winder, managing director at Interpath Advisory and joint administrator, said: “Like many other companies across the hospitality sector, Byron had seen a boost in trading following the end of the COVID lockdown measures. ""However, the sky-high inflation seen in 2022 saw costs spiral and resulted in reduced customer spend, which in turn placed significant cashflow pressure on the business."" After falling into trouble in 2020, the burger chain Byron closed 31 of its sites at a cost of around 650 jobs. At the time the burger chain operated more than 50 restaurants and was majority-owned by Three Hills Capital Partners. Before this, Byron fell into trouble in 2018 and had to go through a restructuring exercise to erase its hefty debt burden which closed some of its underperforming restaurants. Byron has become another victim of the ""casual dining"" downfall which has occurred over the last few years which has seen a number of chain restaurants fall into financial difficulty and have to close a number of their venues.  Other examples include Bella Italia, Cafe Rouge, Gourmet Burger Kitchen (GBK) and Pizza Express. Which Byron Burger restaurants are closing?

Millions of Virgin Mobile customers to be transferred over to O2 - what it means for you,"Virgin Mobile customers will be switched to O2 in stages with the first people to transfer across from March 2023 - the first letters detailing the changes will be sent out from next monthMillions of Virgin Mobile customers will be moved over to O2 in the coming months as part of a huge shake-up. It comes after the two telecoms giants completed a mega £31billion merger in June 2021. Virgin Mobile customers will be switched to O2 in stages with the first people to transfer across from March 2023. The first letters detailing the changes will be sent out from next month. When you receive your letter, it will explain details of your new plan and when you will move over. The letter should give you at least 30 days’ notice and Virgin O2 expects to have everyone transferred over by the end of 2023.   Customers will move to a 30 day rolling contract when they transition to O2 – regardless of whether they are already tied into a contract with Virgin. You will be able to choose a new O2 contract if you wish. But no customers will see the cost of their plan rise following the switch, the mobile network said - and some people will see their allowances increases. For example, some customers will get unlimited texts and voice calls, and either double the data or unlimited data for the same amount. Virgin Mobile customers will also be able to use O2 Priority, where you can get early access to concert tickets and enjoy freebies including Greggs. But one perk you won't be able to use once you've moved to O2, is the ability to rollover data each month.  The Mirror has asked Virgin O2 if customers who are in mid-contract will see the length of their deal stay the same, and we'll update this article when we know more. For those on a 30-day rolling contract with Virgin Mobile, we're checking if you'll be moved across to a similar rolling deal. If you’re being switched to O2, you won’t need to do anything as you’ll be automatically moved across. This means you won’t need to change your SIM or do anything with your handset. The entire Virgin Mobile base transferred over to using the O2 network at the end of last year – so all data, voice and text traffic is already using the O2 connectivity. Virgin Media O2 chief commercial officer Gareth Turpin said: “This is a major milestone moment for Virgin Media O2 as our Virgin Mobile customers start moving over to O2 plans, receiving added value and benefits on top. “Our teams will guide customers through every step of the migration, and we’re laser-focused on making sure this all occurs in the most hassle-free way possible. “With all of our mobile brands now powered by the award-winning O2 network, we are making fantastic progress in our integration plans while continuing to deliver a range of knockout mobile services that cater for all needs.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/millions-virgin-mobile-customers-transferred-28938973
Thrifty mum is already saving money for 2024 energy bills using a clever £1 hack,"Heidi Ondrak, 51, from Plymouth, has shared a clever trick that means she'll already have money put aside for next year's gas and electricity bills before 2024 even startsA mum has revealed a clever trick to manage her household utility bills by thinking ahead, and she's already putting money away for gas and electricity expenses next year. Heidi Ondrak, 51, from Plymouth, has made a name for herself with money-saving ideas and recently shared a way to cook 24 meals for less than £20. She has built up a following of 36,600 on TikTok and 302,600 likes across her videos, where she reveals her top tips for cutting down on costs. In one of her most recent clips, Heidi has told that she has already started saving money for her 2024 gas and electric bills by using one simple trick. In the clip, the mum reveals that through the neo bank Monzo, she is putting away £1 a day for the next year to help her pay for heating in January 2024.   Through the company's app, she has set up personal 'pots' - with one entirely for her heating bills. By putting away £1 a day, which is equivalent to a packet of crisps, Heidi will automatically have £365 to spend on bills come 2024. ""I just woke up and thought I want a heating buffer for next year for when it's cold,"" Heidi told NeedToKnow.online. ""It's the price of a Walkers grab bag of crisps and I don't notice the £1 leaving my account. It has rained for days and even with the dehumidifier, the air felt damp and I thought I wish the heating wasn't so pricey. ""The house feels like it needs drying out so I thought I will prepare for next year better. I want to be able to pay for heating during freezing weeks like the one we had a few weeks ago. It was tolerable but very uncomfortable and frankly quite an ordeal to get through without heating, but I didn't want my monthly direct debit to be any higher. ""This way I have the money upfront and I can use it here and when I need, paying Eon every time I use the heating by using the smart meter. No debt and no increase in direct debit.""  Heidi also explained why it is so important to think ahead when it comes to paying our bills. She continued: ""Planning is key to adapting and it has been really hard to get my bearings in the cost of living crisis with things going up weekly. ""I am planning ahead with contingency pots so I know that, if we have another freezing cold week next year, I have a buffer and I can use the heating and I won't be retrospectively paying for it. I can pay it directly to the supplier that month."" Heidi's £1 tip has gone down a storm on TikTok, with many people admitting they will use the hack for their own bills. ""What a fantastic idea,"" one person wrote, while another said: ""I've set up a Mexico pot....optimism is high."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/thrifty-mum-already-saving-money-28939855
"New gas boilers should be BANNED within the next ten years, report warns","The review says new and replacement gas boilers should be ditched by 2033 - two years earlier than planned - to help cut carbon emissions to zero, but it warns this will come at a huge financial cost to familiesNew gas boilers should be banned within the next ten years, a new report has warned. The review says new and replacement gas boilers should be ditched by 2033 - two years earlier than planned - to help cut carbon emissions to zero. The rollout of low carbon alternatives and heat pumps in UK homes must also be “turbocharged” - but questions have been raised about how people will afford this. The report also calls for all homes to have an energy performance rating of C by 2033 - although, certain properties – such as listed buildings – would be exempt from this. Other suggestions include making landlords provide an “average bill cost” to help renters choose more energy efficient properties. Read More
  The report - which also calls for an “onshore wind revolution” and a “rooftop revolution” that would see an increase in solar panels - was carried out by Tory MP Chris Skidmore and published on Friday. It claims the cost of the net zero transition, including replacing boilers and buying electric cars, will cost households £4,000 to £6,000 each by 2040. But the review also warns that nearly 500,000 households would not make any savings unless the Government provides more support.  In a piece written for The Telegraph, Mr Skidmore warned the UK is “now in a net zero race”.  He added: “There is an active, strategic choice to be made. Does the UK wish to compete in the net zero race, with the chance to lead, or do we wish to simply observe from the sidelines?”  The report states: “The review recognises we have fallen behind, but it sets out how we can be world-leading in these areas once again. “We need to remove the barriers that are in place at the moment.” However, questions have been raised over how realistic some of these new solutions would be - in particular, the mass installing of heat pumps. Charlie Mullins, founder of Pimlico Plumbers, said of the boiler scrappage target recently: ""We need targets that relate to the real world, targets that when you look at the technology and infrastructure available are realistic. ""That's what will get the UK greener, and if we keep up paying lip service to pie in the sky stuff it will take longer because nobody will engage with the issue.""

How much YOU need for decent retirement revealed as cost of 'basic' lifestyle soars,"With soaring energy and food costs, the amount pensioners need to live a decent life has risen significantly. Here we take a look at how much is required to cover three different types of retiree lifestylesThe hike in living costs has hit poorer pensioners far harder than those who are better off, new research shows. To live what is classed as a ""minimum"" lifestyle as a retiree - where you have enough money to ""live with dignity and not just survive"" and enjoy some social events - you now need £12,800 a year for as a single person and £19,900 for a couple.  That's an 18% and 19% rise, respectively, in 12 months, according to research by the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association. The figures are part of its latest influential Retirement Living Standards report, which reveals what annual incomes people need for a ""minimum"", ""moderate"" or ""comfortable"" retirement. They are based on different baskets of goods and services such as food and drink, transport, holidays, clothes and social outings. ""Rising food and fuel prices contributed significantly to the increase in the minimum standard,"" says the PLSA. ""The update also saw the amount of food included within the budget increasing to bring it into line with the up-to-date nutritional research on a healthy diet."" Pensioners on low incomes spent a higher proportion of their budget on food and energy bills, which have shot up in price recently, the PSLA found.    It also looked at the amount younger people will need to have saved by the time they retire to enjoy a decent standard of living. The state pension will rise 10.1% in April in line with the triple lock, bringing it £203.85 or £10,600 annually if you qualify for the full flat rate. But the PSLA, a finance industry-backed body, says that falls £2,300 short of the annual income people need for a minimum standard of living as a pensioner. It added, however, that higher interest rates will help savers as they can get more attractive rates on annuities for their retirement pots as well as better rates on savings accounts. How much do you need for your retirement?  This is how much you would need if you're hoping for a minimum, moderate and comfortable lifestyle, according to the PLSA. The first figure is for a single person and the second for a couple. Minimum lifestyle: £12,800 or £19,900 a year A pensioner on a ""minimum"" lifestyle budget should be able to cover some DIY maintenance and enjoy a week's holiday plus a long weekend in the UK.  The money would only cover public transport and not a car.  A single person would have around £54 to spend on food each week, including eating out and about £580 a year to spend on clothing and footwear. A couple who each receive a full state pension of £10,600 a year from this April, would reach the amount needed for a ""minimum"" level, but a single person would have to supplement this with private pension savings of £36,500.  Moderate lifestyle: £23,300 or £34,000 a year The rise in annual income required for a ""moderate"" lifestyle is more in line with inflation, with an increase of 12 per cent to £23,300 for a single retiree and 11 per cent to £34,000 for a couple. Pensioners on a 'moderate' lifestyle income should have enough to receive some help with home maintenance and decorating each year and to buy a three-year-old car and have it replaced every ten years.  A single person would have around £74 a week for food and £794 a year on clothes and footwear.  'Moderate' retirees should be able to go away for two weeks in Europe each year and one long weekend in the UK. A couple both receiving a full new state pension would need to accumulate retirement pots of £121,000 each for a ""moderate"" lifestyle. But a single person with only one state pension would have to save a much larger pot of £248,000.  Comfortable lifestyle: £37,300 or £54,500 a year The rise in what's needed to live a ""comfortable"" retirement is similar to the rise for a 'moderate' lifestyle, at 11%.  'Comfortable' retirees should be able to afford a new kitchen and bathroom every 10 to 15 years, as well as three weeks holiday abroad, a two-year-old car replaced every five years and extra luxuries such as beauty treatments and theatre trips.  A single person would have around £144 a week to spend on food and £1,500 a year on clothes and footwear. A couple both getting full new state pensions would also need retirement pots of £328,000 each, while a single person would need to have saved £530,000.

You can get paid for your food shop by following this one little-known hack,"It is widely known that you can save money on your food shop by taking advantage of a supermarket's points or reward scheme, however one little known scheme can essentially pay you to shopWith the current state of the UK’s cost of living, many people want to try and make a bit of extra cash or save a little where they can to help with rising costs. It is widely known that you can save some money on your food shop by taking advantage of supermarket rewards scheme such as Tesco Clubcard, Sainsbury’s Nectar card and Asda’s reward stars. However, one savvy shopper has managed to find an extra way to save some cash on top of supermarket’s points and voucher schemes. Writing for YorkshireLive, consumer writer Harriet Morphy-Morris shared her money-making hack saying she had used it on her last few food shops and that she would “never look back”.   Harriet explained how using a supermarket's points or voucher scheme could sometimes trap you to one supermarket as you would need to repeatedly shop there in order to build up your points in order to benefit from them.  However, Harriet said her ""money-saving"" tip meant shoppers could save on top of any ""at till"" discounts as long as they do one specific thing with their debit card before they shop.  Harriet wrote: ""I came across it when logging onto my online banking app after my usual 'nip into Tesco', to see that I had received a small amount of cashback from my bank.  ""Now the amount, of 45p, was rather insignificant and I had initially thought the incoming payment was a result of being overcharged."" After a bit of digging, Harriet discovered that she had actually gotten the money back by activating her in-app ""everyday offers"" which she had accidentally done before her trip to Tesco.  She shared how she didn't know this had existed before this and because she had unknowingly activated the 10% Tesco cashback offer, she managed to get 45p back after spending £4.50 in store.   Apparently, the majority of UK banks offer their own version of this cashback scheme to customers with Harriet noting that Halifax, HSBC, Santander and Lloyds are just a few banks which offer money back for shopping.  To put the cashback offer to the test, Harriet used it again when she next took a trip to Sainsbury's.  She went into the offers on her bank account and activated the 8% cashback offer for Sainsbury's, all she then had to do was pay for the shop using the bank card connected to the offer.  With cashback offers such as this, the more money you spend the more cashback you get so Harriet said she uses the offers when she is doing her big weekly food shop.  With this particular shop, Harriet stocked up on some monthly household essentials such as loo roll, washing up powder, and cleaning products which helped her increase the price. In total, Harriet says her shop came to £65.51, which was £15 over the minimum cashback spend of £50 for this particular offer, and from this, she managed to receive £5.24 in cash back a few days later.  Harriet wrote: ""It may not sound like a huge amount but the £5 is on top of the points I collected from my Nectar card which is completely separate. ""From this shop, I collected 65 points on my Nectar card as well as cash back into my bank account."" With this cashback scheme, which Harriet said was different to the others she knew of, was that you didn't need to sign up for anything, all you needed to do was log into your online banking or bank app and activate the offer.  Harriet closed her article by saying: ""It's a small step to activate but it's become a huge part to help me save money on food. Essentially it feels like I am getting paid to do my food shop.""

Tesco hikes price of Heinz tomato soup tins by a huge 79% - up from 95p to £1.70,"After a steady increase in price during the cost of living crisis, the latest price jump saw an increase of 21 per cent - nearly doubling the price of a single Heinz tomato soup tinTesco has hiked the price of a tin of Heinz tomato soup by 79 per cent - up from 95p to £1.70. After a steady increase in price during the cost of living crisis, the latest jump saw an increase of 21 per cent - nearly doubling the price. It comes amid a crippling cost of living crisis as shoppers struggle to make their cash go far enough to feed their families.  Last week, Tesco also announced it will be price-locking thousands of products until Easter of this year, in order to support customers with the cost of living. The announcement comes as UK food prices are reported to have soared to a record rate in December.   The big four supermarket chain said the price lock would be not only on popular branded products such as Heinz, McCains, and Birds Eye, but on its own brand staples too. The price lock will not only cover Tesco’s fresh, frozen, and cupboard items, but it will also expand to health and beauty products as well as pet food and household products such as detergent. Jason Tarry, chief executive of Tesco said: “As we start the New Year, we know times are tough for many of our customers right now. “We hope this extended price lock commitment gives our customers the certainty of knowing that over a thousand household favourites and own brand essentials will stay at the same low price for months to come – helping them budget when they need it most.”  Tesco previously announced other price locks for its products, with the most recent being in October last year, which lasted until the start of 2023. Industry experts have now accused Tesco of double standards, with one source saying: ""To raise prices after shouting about holding Heinz to account stinks of double standards.""

Warning after three million people cut off because they couldn't afford their energy bills,"Research from Citizens Advice found that 3.2 million people in the UK ran out of credit on their prepayment meter last year because they couldn’t afford to top upCitizens Advice has warned that millions of people are being left in the cold and dark as prepayment meters continue to be cut off.  New research from the charity found that 3.2 million people across Great Britain ran out of credit on their prepayment meter last year because they couldn’t afford to top up their energy bills. This figure equates to around one household cut-off every 10 seconds, said Citizens Advice. Citizens Advice says for most it’s not just a one-off as it has found more than two million people are being disconnected at least once a month. More than one in five have been cut off in the last year and spent more than 24 hours without gas and electricity.   In particular, the charity is the most concerned about disabled people and those living with long-term health conditions.  Nearly one in five households include someone in this group who ran out of credit last year did not have energy for two days. Citizens Advice previously raised concerns to Ofgem and the government that it had seen evidence of suppliers forcing people in these groups onto prepayment meters.  In October, Ofgem warned suppliers that not enough was being done to identify customers in vulnerable circumstances before installing a prepayment meter. However, in the month following Ofgem’s intervention more than a third of prepayment meter households including a disabled person or someone with a long-term health condition, were cut off from their energy supply at least once.   Citizens Advice says that is more than 470,000 struggling households left without energy.  The charity is now calling for a total ban on forced prepayment meter installations until new protections are introduced, ensuring households can no longer be fully cut off from gas and electricity. Citizens Advice has seen a 229% increase in the past year in the number of people coming for help who can't afford to top up their prepayment meter and in in 2022 it saw more people who couldn't top up their prepayment meter than it did in the whole of the last 10 years combined.  Based on Ofgem figures, Citizens Advice estimates that around 600,000 people were forced onto a prepayment meter because they couldn't afford their energy bills in 2022.  It also predicts 160,000 more people could be moved onto a prepayment meter by the end of winter if no further action is taken. Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said:“All too often the people finding it hardest to pay their bills are being forced onto a prepayment meter they can’t afford to top up. This puts them at real risk of being left in cold, damp and dark homes. “The staggering rise in the cost of living means many simply cannot afford to heat and power their homes to safe levels. “New protections are needed to stop people being fully cut off from gas and electricity. Until then, there must be a total ban on energy companies forcing those already at breaking point onto prepayment meters. If Ofgem doesn't act, the government must intervene.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/warning-one-person-left-dark-28929834

If you claim, you'll get paid £21.80 per week for your eldest or only child, and then an extra £14.45 for every additional child you have, there is also no limit You can claim the money if you are bringing up a child who is  under 16 under 20 if they stay in approved education or training  Guardian's Allowance  If you are bringing up a child whose parents have died or are unable to look after them, you may also be able to claim Guardians Allowance alongside Child Benefit.  Guardians Allowance is currently paid at £18.55 a week and similar to Child Benefit, is paid every four weeks. This payment is tax-free and is not affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge (HICBC), it also does not count as income if you're claiming Tax Credits. You can also claim this on occasions where there is still one surviving parent.   Maternity Allowance Maternity Allowance is usually paid to you if you don’t qualify for Statutory Maternity Pay and the amount you can claim is dependent on your working circumstance.  The payments range from £27 a week up until £156.66 and is paid every two or four weeks.  The money is paid for up to 39 weeks and you can claim the money after you have been pregnant for 26 weeks, payments started up to 11 weeks before your baby is due.  Marriage Allowance  Marriage Allowance is not a benefit you can claim and is more like a tax perk from the Government.  The perk lets you transfer £1,260 of your Personal Allowance to your spouse or civil partner which then reduces their tax by up to £252 in the tax year.  The higher-earning spouse, who must be a basic-rate taxpayer, will then receive a tax credit equivalent to the amount of personal allowance that has been transferred to them.  To be eligible, the lower earners' income before tax must be less than the personal allowance level of £12,570.  You cannot claim Marriage Allowance if you’re living together but you’re not married or in a civil partnership.  Working Tax Credits  Working Tax Credit is money provided to boost the income of working people who are on a low income, and even though the Government has replaced this with Universal Credit, you can still make a claim for it if you already receive Child Tax Credit.  Depending on your working and personal circumstances, you can receive from £860 to £2,125 every year with the money paid every week or every four weeks.   Jobseekers Allowance (JSA) If you are unemployed and looking for work or are working less than 16 hours a week on average you may be able to apply for New Style Job Seekers Allowance. Paid every two weeks, this can be claimed on its own as well as alongside Univeral Credit and to claim, you must have been working within the last two to three years as an employee.  Once again depending on your circumstance, you can be awarded a ""personal allowance"" each week of between £61.05 and £77.   Low income Universal Credit Universal Credit is a payment for people over 18 but under the State Pension age who are on a low income or out of work.  The monthly payments can depend as they can include support for the cost of housing, children and childcare, and extra financial support for people with disabilities, carers and people too ill to work. However, if you’re claiming Universal Credit, you’ll get one standard allowance for your household and for 2022-23 it is:   £265.31 a month for single claimants under 25  £334.91 a month for single claimants aged 25 or over  £416.45 a month for joint claimants both under 25  £525.72 a month for joint claimants with either aged 25 or over.  Employment Support Allowance (ESA) This benefit is available to claim if you have an illnesses or disabilities that make it hard for you to work and there are two types you can claim:   Income-related Employment and Support Allowance - this is being replaced by Universal Credit and new claims can only be made by those claiming a ""legacy benefit"".  Contributory/New Style Employment and Support Allowance - you can claim this is you have paid enough National Insurance Contributions and have a limited capability to work which is decided by the DWP through a work capability assessment.  Again, the amount you can get through Employment Support Allowance can depend on a lot of factors, such as your age, who you live with, your income.  Before the assessment, you can receive between £61.06 to £77 a week, and after it can go as high as £117.60 a week depending on what specific category you fall into.   Pension Credit This benefit can give you extra money to help with your living costs if you're over the state pension age and on a low income, it can also be a ""gateway"" benefit for other financial support.  Pension Credit has two parts called Guarantee Pension Credit and Savings Pension Credit and you are able to receive both depending on your circumstances.  For Guarantee Pension Credit, the calculation to find out how much you can claim involves comparing your weekly income, including your partners, to a weekly amount set by the Government which is:   £182.60 per week for single people  £278.70 per week for couples  If you have less, then you will receive an amount which will top you up to this level.  For savings, it depends on whether you have more or less weekly income then:   £14.48 for single people £16.20 for couples  The actual amount you get will vary for each person because you could also be entitled to extra amounts, depending on your circumstances.  Housing Benefit   You can claim money to help with the cost of your home, whether that be rent or mortgage but you can only make a new claim for it if you   You, and your partner if you've got one, have reached State Pension age  you or your partner have been getting Pension Credit since before 15 May 2019  you live in temporary accommodation  your  landlord’s a county council, charity or housing association and they give you care or support – for example if you live in sheltered housing  The amount you get is dependent on where you live, who you live with, your income, and your savings and you will only find out once you have applied. It is not always guaranteed that it will cover your housing costs entirely.   Council Tax Support If you claim certain benefits or are on a low income then you can have your council tax bill reduced by 25%, 50% or even up to 100%.  The discount is decided by your local council and the amount you can get is dependent on your circumstances. To see if you can get a discount you should check your local council's website to find out their criteria.  Free School Meals Low-income households on certain benefits with children are able to claim free school meals that children can have every day. Children who also qualify can also get meals, vouchers and food parcels provided to them outside term time. Bereavement Allowance You may be able to get Bereavement Support Payment if your spouse or civil partner died in the last 21 months and you must claim within three months of your partner's death.  It is paid at two levels, a higher and lower rate, and you get one lump sum payment and then 18 monthly payments afterwards.  The Higher rate - first payment £3,500 - monthly payment - £350  Lower rate - first payment £2,500 - monthly payment - £100   Health Attendance Allowance  This benefit is available to people over the state pension age and  It’s paid at two different rates and how much you get depends on the level of care that you need because of your disability. If you have a successful claim you could be eligible for weekly payments of either £61.86 or £92.40. Personal Independence Payment (PIP) If you have a disability of long-term physical or mental health condition you claim this benefit to help if you have difficulty doing certain everyday tasks or getting around. There are two components to PIP and they pay different rates for each:  The Daily Living - Standard: £61.85 Higher: £92.40 The Mobility Part - Standard: £24.45 Higher: £64.50  You can claim both components if you need it and you can be eligible for any combination of the different amounts. Carer's Allowance If you provide care for someone else, whether it be someone your related to or not, for at least 35 hours a week you could be able to claim £69.70 a week in Carer’s Allowance.

Martin Lewis' MSE website explains if you should fix into a mortgage deal now,"After shooting up in September last year, fixed rate mortgage deals have been falling the past couple of months. But is now a good time to lock in? Here we take a closer look at your options and the forecast aheadWith interest rates on fixed mortgages continuing to fall, many people will wonder whether they should secure a deal now or hold off. Rates shot up in September last year after the Government's disastrous Mini Budget, with fixed rate deals below 5% completely disappearing. But they started returning November and have continued to improve as a result of increased economic stability coupled with competition between lenders.  There are now hundreds on offer below 5%.  Experts are predicting rates will continue to fall even further in the coming months - some brokers say maybe as low as 4% - which leaves potential lenders with the difficult decision of whether to sign up to a fixed rate mortgage now or wait. Have you lost your home because of rising rates? Or been forced to pull out of a mortgage deal? Let us know: mirror.money.saving@mirror.co.uk   To help you make a decision, Martin Lewis' website MoneySavingExpert has taken a closer look at the current situation and what lies ahead. Of course, no one knows for sure what will happen to mortgage rates in the future - this is just their rough guide to help you make the steps toward coming up with a decision.  What are the current fixed rates on offer? According to MoneySavingExpert, there are currently deals with interest rates as low as 4.56% on two-year fixes and 4.38% on five year fixes.  For ten years, the rates are even lower. Halifax, for example, has a 10-year fix at just 4.04% and Lloyds Bank at an even lower 3.99%, though the latter is only available to people already borrowing with Lloyds. Low rates, explains the website, do sometimes come with expensive arrangement fees, something always worth checking before you lock in.  Should I lock in now? It all depends on your current circumstances.  Ultimately, you should speak to a mortgage broker who can offer some expert advice before you make a final decision. If your current mortgage deal is coming to an end, make sure you don't fall onto a lender's standard variable rate (SVR) as these tend to be the most expensive.  Some of these have edged over 7% recently, says MoneySavingExpert. You could jump onto a tracker mortgage that allows you to change to a fixed deal without paying a fee if you're worried about fixing. Tracker rates follow the Bank of England base rate, rising and falling as it does. Right now, tracker rates are as low as 3.74%.  It's worth noting that the base rate increased for the ninth time in December last year, taking it to 3.5%.  So, as MoneySavingExpert explains, taking this route does come with some risk.  If you do want to fix right now - for example, for price certainty - some lenders let you lock in a rate six months in advance and many more let you lock in three months ahead. The downside is, you won't be able to leave the deal early without paying an exit fee. Also, although experts are predicting fixed rate deals will continue to fall, there is of course no guarantee. If you have a few months left on your current fixed rate mortgage, you have a bit more wriggle room and MoneySavingExpert suggests it could be worth holding off.

Aldi is making a huge change to its website and Specialbuys - but its bad for shoppers,"The supermarket will phase out its wine and spirits deliveries later this month, with Specialbuys to follow in the autumn, as part of the huge shake-up of its online operationsAldi is set to axe online deliveries as part of a huge change to its website. The supermarket will phase out its wine and spirits deliveries later this month, with Specialbuys to follow in the autumn. Aldi will still offer a grocery click and collect service, which sees customers order their food shop online to pick up in store. It isn't clear if there will be any job losses as a result of online ordering coming to an end. However, the supermarket is said to be hopeful that affected staff can be moved to other departments within the company. A spokesperson for Aldi said: “Aldi is more popular than ever, and we are prioritising making our wine and Specialbuy products available in our stores.   “We keep our prices low by being the most efficient retailer in Britain and we have therefore taken the decision to stop selling wine and spirits online for home delivery from later this month.  “We will also stop selling our Specialbuys online for home delivery later this year. Our grocery click and collect service will continue, and we would like to thank every customer that has bought Aldi products online.  “Aldi will continue to consider new digital services in the future.” It comes after Aldi reported its ""best ever Christmas"" with sales jumping 26% to a record high of £1.4billion. Fresh meat products saw a huge increase as shoppers stocked up over the festive season, with fresh poultry and pork options both up over 28%. Chilled desserts and fresh cheeses jumped by almost 30% and 50% respectively. In total, customers bought more than 48 million mince pies, 38 million pigs in blankets and more than 1,700 tonnes of sprouts this Christmas.  Meanwhile, snacks such as crisps and nuts were up over 40% thanks to the World Cup, which took place just before Christmas.  Aldi has just been named the cheapest supermarket in the UK as it continues to steal customers from the likes of Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury's. The budget supermarket was crowned the lowest priced for seven consecutive months, from June to December. In comparison, Lidl was the cheapest for five months, from January to May. Which? tracked the price of items sold at Aldi, Asda, Lidl, Morrisons, Ocado, Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Waitrose throughout 2022 to find out where shoppers can get more for their money. The results for December showed a basket of 48 groceries cost £81.63 on average at Aldi - while Lidl shoppers paid £83.24. Tesco came in third place (£93.42) followed by Asda (£93.44), Sainsbury’s (£95.71) and Morrisons (£97.12). ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/aldi-making-huge-change-website-28934945
"Envelope challenge could help you save £5,000 in less than one year - how it works","You’ll need 100 empty envelopes, with each one labelled with a cash amount from £1 to £100 - then each week, you pick two at random and then you save however much is written on the envelopesIf your goal in 2023 is to save money, then why not try out the envelope challenge? To get you started, you’ll need 100 empty envelopes - then label each one with a cash amount from £1 to £100. Each week, you pick two envelopes at random and then you save however much is written on the envelopes. If you’re picking out two envelopes a week, you’ll finish the challenge in 50 weeks - so just under one year. If you don’t skip any envelopes, the most you’ll save is £5,050. If you wished you'd have started last week, to mark the New Year and have the money saved up by Christmas, you could pick four envelopes this week to catch up. You should be aware that some weeks you could end up needing to put away quite a bit - for example, if you pull out the £99 and £100 envelopes in one week.   If you worry you’ll struggle to save this much, you can reduce the challenge to 50 envelopes and you would still put away £1,275. You could also lower the amounts on the envelopes, so you could save in multiples of 50p instead of £1. Or instead of pulling out two envelopes each week, you could decide to do just one envelope - although this will take longer. Very few people carry much cash around nowadays, which is ideally how you’re meant to complete this challenge. However, if you don’t really use coins and notes, you can set up a bank account to deposit the money into each week. With the digital method, you could put bits of paper labelled 1 to 100 into a jar, then pull two out each week to see how much to deposit into the account.  If the envelope challenge doesn't take your fancy, there are plenty of other fun ways to save cash. There is the 1p challenge, which sees the amount you save increase by 1p each day. If you start this on January 1, you would save 1p, then 2p on January 2 and 3p on January 3 - all the way through to £3.65 on December 31. If you carry on until the end of the year, you’ll have saved up £667.95 in total. It isn't too late to catch up on the days you've missed - you would just need to save 78p today, then start the challenge properly from tomorrow. So this would mean 13p saved on January 13, then 14p on January 14, and so on.  We've rounded up five money saving challenges here.

Single mum says selling stuff online is helping her get through cost of living crisis,"Clare Berrett says selling unwanted items online can help you free some space in your home and also boost your income as the cost of living crisis hits households around the UK The standing joke in my house is that anything not nailed down will end up on eBay. But while I raise a wry smile when my kids roll their eyes as I once again grab the parcel tape, the truth behind it is very serious.  The cost of living crisis has given me many a sleepless night.  Selling stuff on sites such as eBay, Vinted, Gumtree and Facebook Marketplace has become an essential source of income for me.  It is a second salary – being an inclusion support assistant is my real job. With Christmas just behind us, finances are tighter than ever for everyone. Research this week from eBay revealed that having a clear-out could earn you £1,200 by selling unwanted items. There is money to be made from stuff such as bikes, hair dryers and even Christmas trees. I’m a single mum to Isabel, nine, and Henry, seven. When they both came to me saying their school shoes were too tight, my heart sank. I saw the invisible £60 floating out of my wilting bank account.   I also had to put fuel in my car, there was a water bill to pay, and, of course, food to put on the table. With the price of everything rising, cash had been getting tighter. So this was the last thing I needed. Then... BING, I had an email from eBay. The iPad with a cracked screen that had been in the spare room for months had sold for £80. I was saved. And that is what has been keeping me afloat for the past couple of months, selling things online. I had always loved flogging stuff, but it had previously been a bit of extra pocket money. But now, the £25 I got for a shower tent I used on one camping trip, and the £15 I earned for some of Isabel’s old shorts meant I could fill the fridge without worrying too much. It’s gut-wrenching having to choose between food and fuel.  But if it’s sink or swim, I’m determined to swim. Well, doggy paddle until the crisis is over. But who knows when that will be? It’s scary to think I may have months, perhaps years of struggling. So these selling sites have become a lifeline. Within a week of joining Vinted I made over £100 from clothes that were gathering dust in the spare room. But whereas before I’d pop them on sites as and when I fancied, now I actively put a few hours aside each weekend to list them. It has become a job in itself. I’ve learned what sells on certain sites and that you may not make as much for an item on Vinted, but you sell more on it.  It is essential to get the photos right and to include as much information as possible about the item. It can be a pain taking the trips to the post office and spending hours wrapping parcels, but it’s worth it. My sideline, which is also decluttering my house, is keeping my head above water, and ensuring I don’t feel guilty about a trip to the cinema. For more tips and advice, visit www.mumssavvysavings.com. How to get the best price One of the keys to success is not putting the price too high.   People want a bargain so if you would take £5 instead of £7, do it.   It’s £5 you wouldn’t have had before and it could prevent your items sitting there for ages.   Also, remember to send the item with the right postage.   If you don’t have proof of postage, sent in the correct packaging, people may say it hasn’t arrived or is damaged.   You then have no item and you will be out of pocket if you have to give a refund.     Also, it might seem common sense but getting the best photo of what you’re selling is vital.   People are much more likely to buy something they can see clearly than something in a dark blurry picture.   Emma Bradley, from Mums Savvy Savings, says: “Take a few good photos from different angles. Take them outside in natural light if possible, as this helps them look good.”    She adds: “Over the course of a weekend you could make a couple of hundred pounds.”   Emma Grant, from eBay UK, says buyers want a full description, including brands and sizes. She also says good photos are essential, as is not overpricing something.   She adds: “Try searching for similar items on eBay to make sure you’re going for the right price. And ask yourself ‘would I pay this price for this item?’.”   Vinted’s consumer PR lead, Natacha Blanchard, agrees that a compelling description is key to selling.   She says: “Putting ‘white dress’ is fine, but ‘white lace Ibiza dress’ is better.”   And finally, honesty will get you a long way.   Sellers are urged to mention any defects and to show signs of usage in photos.  Where to sell and what works best Emma Bradley, who runs the blog mumssavvysavings.com agrees selling sites are very useful in times like these.   She says: “Having a good clear out and selling what you can is a great way to make money fast.”   Emma sells old clothes on Vinted is, with her top tip being to put items on hangers and be clear on sizing. “People don’t want ‘This will fit anyone from 8-14’, so be exact.”   For younger people, Emma recommends Depop, which is popular for selling and buying designer items.   While Facebook Marketplace, she adds, is ideal for larger items you don’t want to post. “Children’s toys sell well on this platform for this reason,” she says.   “There are no postage costs or commission, meaning that you set the price and receive it all.   “Collection is usually quick too, as it’s often people in your local community.”   How much difference does it make? Research by eBay showed nearly eight out of 10 people in Britain had begun, or were considering selling items from around the home to support the rising costs of living. And four in five UK adults were concerned about the increasing inflation.   Emma Grant, head of Pre-Loved at eBay UK, said: “While selling unwanted items might not be a solution to the problem at large, it can be an effective way to make some extra cash to go towards bills or contribute to your savings for a holiday this summer.”   With more than 27 million shoppers on eBay every month, Emma said that the online marketplace could seriously help top up your bank balance.   She said: “Simultaneously you might help someone else find something they’ve been looking for, but without the hefty price tag.   “A win for you, someone else and the planet alike.”   A skateboard could earn you £23, while that old laptop could see £290 pinging its way into your bank account.

DWP planning major benefits shake-up for millions of sick and disabled Brits,"Tory ministers are looking at changing the way fit-for-work tests happen as part of a change to the benefit system - but the details have not yet been nailed downTory ministers are planning a major shake-up of benefits payments for millions of sick and disabled people in Britain. ‘Perverse’ fit-for-work tests could be ditched in their current form, as sources claim they make people “prove how incapable you are”. Instead, ministers are looking at a system that would let people keep claiming some sickness payments even if they return to work. At the moment, sickness and disability payments in ESA or Universal Credit depend partly on people’s ”capability” to work. Under a planned shake-up, these benefits could instead be “tapered” away as people start earning, like other payments in Universal Credit. There could also be tax breaks for people who return to work, it is reported. It is even reported that over-50s could be exempted from income tax. But the plans are vague and not finalised - and Vicki Nash of the charity Mind blasted them as “utterly unworkable”. She warned the new system “seems to be aimed at forcing people to show how they can return to the workforce”. Read More
  She added: “ Even for those who would consider taking employment advice, the fear created by the unjust benefit sanctions system can make it feel too risky to trust the DWP to be able to support them.  “Unless the DWP removes the threat of sanctions, they will continue to struggle getting people who might be able to return to employment to take up support.” A Green Paper in 2021 suggested different payments could be combined into a “new single benefit” with “different priorities” to the current system. That sparked concern because PIP - Britain's main disability benefit - is paid regardless of people’s wealth. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has since insisted there are “no plans” to means-test PIP, which is claimed by 3million Brits. No10 today said it was ""not aware of a change in that.” No10 said the reporting was “speculative” but confirmed there were “a range of things we are looking at.” “Further steps” are needed to “help more people back into work” and the government are “considering the best policy options”, a spokesman said. Firmer plans will be in a long-awaited White Paper before the Budget on March 15 .  A government source told the Times: ""It's very much not the case that we'd be relaxing assessments so you could be perfectly fit and claiming. “It will be more about being supported into work and supported to do the things you can do, rather than incentivised to prove how incapable you are"".  It comes after the number of people ‘economically inactive’ due to long-term sickness soared from 2million in spring 2019 to 2.5million in summer 2022. More than half of them are aged 50 to 64. Resolution Foundation chief executive Torsten Bell warned “it's not going to bring back” most people into work. He said: “Once people have left the labour market for a large period of time, they're very unlikely to come back.  “Someone that's been inactive for more than two years, which lots will have been since the pandemic, only 1% or 2% of them come back to work.” It comes after Labour this week pledged “genuine, quality, tailored support” to help more long-term sick people into work. Welfare chief Jonathan Ashworth announced he would spare people reassessments for benefits if they take a job, and it doesn’t work out within a year. Rishi Sunak said last week “we need to look at how our welfare system is operating”. The PM asked: “Is it operating in the way that we would like to make sure that we are supporting and incentivising people who can be, to be in work?” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/dwp-planning-major-benefits-shake-28934163
Taxpayers given stronger protection against 'rip-off' firms that claim your cash,"HMRC confirmed it was launching a consultation into third-party tax rebate firms back in June last year and it has now published new measures to help taxpayers - here's what it meansTaxpayers have been given stronger protection against “rip-off” third-party firms that charge you to process tax rebates. These repayment agents can charge a fee of up to 48% for their service - so around half your money owed - despite it being free to claim a tax rebate yourself through the Gov.uk website. To confuse things further, many of the websites - which often pop up as advertisements on social media - are designed with the same colours and logos as HMRC.  The Mirror has previously spoken to several people who have used these tax rebate companies without realising they're not linked to HMRC - or free to use. HMRC confirmed it was launching a consultation back in June last year and it has now published new measures to help taxpayers.   Tax rebate firms will now have to register with HMRC and improve their standards so customers fully understand what they are signing up for. The use of legally binding assignments as part of claiming an income tax repayment will also stop. Assignments legally transfer the benefit of the taxpayer's repayments to the agent - but they can only be cancelled if the agent and taxpayer both agree. The Mirror has heard from customers who say they've struggled to get in contact with repayment agents - leaving them unable to cancel their assignment. HMRC also said it is often the case that the terms and conditions of these assignments are not made clear to the customer.  Under new arrangements, if a taxpayer uses a repayment agent, they will need to make a nomination, which they can cancel at any time. Stricter rules will also introduce a new 14-day cooling off period when entering into an agreement with an agent, so they can cancel any arrangements. HMRC received more than 2,200 complaints about repayment agents between January 2022 and October 2022. Angela MacDonald, HMRC's deputy chief executive and second permanent secretary, said: ""Taxpayers deserve better - we want to make sure they are better protected before choosing to enter into an agreement with a repayment agent. ""HMRC's updated standards for agents will level the playing field and provide the benchmark we expect all repayment agents to meet.""  Financial Secretary to the Treasury Victoria Atkins said: ""For too long taxpayers have been left in the dark as a result of misleading and opaque agreements with repayment agents. ""These new measures will ensure those who are entitled to claim a tax repayment or relief can do so freely and easily - whether they choose to do this themselves or by using an agent."" Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown: “HMRC is clamping down on tax rebate rip-offs. “Taxpayers were being charged high fees by companies they had sometimes been bamboozled into believing were part of HMRC. “In some cases, they were even charged these fees on rebates the company had nothing to do with too. “It’s demanding more clarity from these companies, more accountability and new rules to help stop them taking a chunk of future rebates. “Thousands of people had complained about the way these firms were operating, so better regulation is very welcome.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/taxpayers-given-stronger-protection-against-28926444
People are only just realising what the numbers on boilers mean - and it could cut bills,"The numbers on your boiler could hold the key to helping you make a dent in your energy bills - but what do they mean, and how do they impact how much you spend?Amid the staggering cost of energy, many of us have been looking at ways we can cut back on our electricity and gas usage, such as switching off lights we're not using or running our washing machines in the middle of the night. But did you know that your boiler itself could hold the key to helping you save some money this winter? If you've ever taken a look at your boiler, you may have noticed either a dial or a digital screen with numbers on it. And it turns out those numbers could help you reduce the amount you spend on your energy bills, according to an energy expert.   According to Uswitch director of regulation Richard Nuedegg, the numbers on your boiler indicate the flow temperature for the device, and most boilers will have two dials or sets of digital screens - one for heating, and one for hot water. Richard told The Sun that boilers will usually be set to a default temperature that's between 75 and 80 degrees Celcius, but that could be driving up your energy bills unnecessarily. Unfortunately, saving money with this trick only works if you've got a combi boiler, but if that's the type of boiler you have in your home, you could reduce your bills by turning down your flow temperature to between 75 and 60 degrees Celcius. Richard said: ""For combi boilers, the recommended output temperature for the radiators is 75oC and at least 60oC for water, which is the temperature that kills legionella bacteria.  ""People with a condensing combi boiler may be able to turn down the flow temperature to save themselves some money on their energy bills."" Legionella is a bacteria that grows in standing water and flourishes at temperatures between 20 and 45 degrees, so it's important to keep your boiler's flow temperature high enough to it off. But if you were to drop your boiler's temperature down to 60 degrees, you could see your consumption reduce by 9%, which will save you around £100 per year on your energy bills.   Meanwhile, one man previously claimed you can dry clothes in cold air without ever needing to turn your heating on. Graham Posser ditched his tumble dryer in favour of a 20-watt fan, and pointed the device at his clothes after hanging them up on an airer in a room with the window open. He then used a moisture meter to check if the clothes were still damp a few hours later, and found they were completely dry - and it had only cost him 0.68p per hour to run the fan.

Households to get free £600 energy help this month - see who is eligible,"More energy support ranging from £200 to £600 is set to be given to millions across the UK who have missed out on help over the last few monthsAs the energy crisis continues to rage on, millions of households across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not actually received help with their energy bills under the Government's current scheme.  However, this is about to change as those who have missed out are set to receive financial support.  The groups that are targeted in the latest round of energy help are residents of Northern Ireland, along with those who use live in park homes such as caravans, and those using alternative fuels. We explain everything you need to know, including who is eligible and when the payments are roughly expected.    Northern Ireland energy support payments  If your household pays for energy by direct debit then you should have £600 paid into your bank account automatically by your electricity supplier. This is similar to how the energy support scheme works in the rest of the UK. The first payment is for £400, which is the same discount all households in the UK have received through the Energy Bills Support Scheme, then there will be an additional £200 on top. This extra payment is in recognition of the reliance on alternative fuels such as heating oil in Northern Ireland The Government has confirmed that payments will be received “from January” for direct debit households.  If you do not pay by direct debit then you will receive a voucher in order to claim the money. According to the Post Office, there are around half a million households in Northern Ireland and they should start receiving their vouchers again from around January 16 over a few weeks. Similar to the UK’s scheme, the energy vouchers will be redeemable at any Post Office counter and will be valid until March 31. The voucher can also reissued if they are lost. To redeem your voucher at the Post Office, you'll need to take along the voucher, the letter from your supplier issued with your voucher, proof of address dated before 2 January 2023, and photo ID.  Keypad customers will also need to bring their keypad app or top up card.  Park home, houseboat and care homes If you live in a park home, a houseboat, off-grid or in care homes, in England, Scotland or Wales, you will be due to receive a payment of £400 to help with the cost of energy. However, you will need to apply for the money. The Government has said that ""applications will open in January"" but however has not clarified exactly when this will be. They have also not explained how the £400 payments will be received by eligible households. This payment is the same payment for all households in England   If you pay your bills through your landlord  The £400 energy bill scheme is also available to those who pay their bills through their landlord via a commercial contract. To apply for the money, you will likely need to go to Gov.uk and apply through there or to a dedicated customer helpline. Once processed, your details will be shared with your local council and the payment will be made in one instalment. The Government said last month that it will be publishing details on eligibility and opening a portal on GOV.UK, offering a ""short online application process"" for eligible households to apply for the £400 support. It also hopes to start making payments to several councils in mid-January with a view to widening the rollout in late January. If you use heating oil, LPG or alternative fuels If you use a different fuel source you are due to receive a payment of £200 from next month however you may need to apply to get it.  The Government has not announced specific details for this payment by has said it will be for households in England, Scotland or Wales that use heating oil, have an LPG boiler, biomass boiler or use a similar alternative fuel to heat their home.  The Government has confirmed that the payment will come in Febraury rather than “in the New Year” when originally announced.  The one-off £200 grant, which is on top of the £400 support payment, will be paid automatically through your electricity supplier if you have a direct relationship with one. However, if you're fully “off the grid” you will need to apply though a Gov.uk portal that's due to launch for applications next month. The Government are yet to confirm how it will identify those who will be eligible for the payment as there is no register for people who do not use mains gas for the heating.  They have also not confirmed how the payments will be made.  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/households-free-600-energy-help-28928477

British passport applications will see a huge change next month - and everyone is affected,"The fee for a standard online application made from within the UK will rise from £75.50 to £82.50 for adults and £49 to £53.50 for children, the Government has announcedThe cost of applying for a new British passport will rise next month, it's been revealed. Government chiefs will introduce new passport fees for all applications on February 2, which will affect those newly applying or renewing their passport. The fee for a standard online application made from within the UK will rise from £75.50 to £82.50 for adults and £49 to £53.50 for children. Postal applications will increase from £85 to £93 for adults and £58.50 to £64 for children. The Government's webpage announcing the proposals said: ""The new fees will help the Home Office move towards a system that meets its costs through those who use it, reducing reliance on funding from general taxation.   ""The Government does not make any profit from the cost of passport applications. ""The fees will also contribute to the cost of processing passport applications, consular support overseas, including for lost or stolen passports, and the cost of processing British citizens at UK borders.  ""The increase will also help enable the Government to continue improving its services.""  It is the first time in five years that the cost of applying for a passport has increased, the Home Office said, adding that the proposals are subject to parliamentary scrutiny.   The Mirror reported how Passports will continue to be issued in the Queen’s name despite her death. Travel documents being distributed months after the late monarch’s death will last up to 10 years. It means passports could be the last documents to officially carry the authority of the last monarch. Those issued now will be valid up to 2031 when King Charles will be 84.  A spokesman said: “Passports referencing the King will be issued once operational changes have been implemented.” The famous message on the first page said: “Her Britannic Majesty’s Secretary of State requests and requires in the name of Her Majesty all those whom it may concern to allow the bearer to pass freely…” But work has already started to change money and stamps. Coins featuring King Charles’s image are in production by the Royal Mint and images of new notes are expected from the Bank of England by the end of the year.

Details on £400 energy support for people in 'alternative' homes to be announced soon,"Those who will be eligible for the £400 payment are people in ""alternative"" housing or who already pay their energy bills as part of all-inclusive rent which goes to their landlordPeople who live in houseboats, park homes, off-grid or care homes are among those expected to benefit from the £400 energy support scheme in the coming few weeks.   The Energy Bill Support Scheme supplies ""alternative funding"" for those who do not have a direct relationship with their electricity supplier.  Among those who will be eligible, the Government says are people in these categories or pay their energy bills as part of all-inclusive rent which goes to their landlord. The Daily Record reports the UK Government last month said it will publish details on those who are eligible soon.   It will also open a portal on Gov.uk offering a ""short online application process"" for eligible households to apply for the £400 support.   Climate Minister Graham Stuart MP said “eligibility, timescales and method of delivery” for the alternative household scheme will be announced “shortly”. Mr Stuart also provided an update in a written response to parliament before Christmas.  He said: “The Government is working to finalise the details of the Energy Bill Support Scheme Alternative Funding and have the process up and running for applications this winter.  ""Eligibility, timescales and method of delivery will be announced shortly.”  A helpline will also be made available for those unable to apply online and applications will be validated, and payments processed by the relevant local authority. Last month The Mirror reported how the Government has confirmed it will provide support to roughly another 900,000 homes across England, Scotland and Wales that don't have a direct relationship with their energy supplier.  These households have not received the £400 help from the Energy Bills Support Scheme which has been given to those who pay their bills by direct debit.  This support has been split up over six months, with £66 paid in October and November, and the £67 from December to March. The Energy Bills Support Scheme Alternative Funding (EBSS Alternative Funding) is to go to people living in care homes, caravan parks, houseboats, homes supplied through private wires, socially rented homes, farmers and households living off-grid.  Eligible households will be able to apply online for the EBSS Alternative Funding by filling out a form on the government's website. Once customers have applied to receive support and their applications have been processed and verified, their details will be shared with local authorities. They will then deliver the one-off, non-repayable support The Government said the exact date for when you receive the support will depend on when you made the application.

eBay purchase warning after couple's gas stove EXPLODES rocking UK street 'like a bomb',"Firefighters told Sharon and Ray Baines that they had a lucky escape after the couple acted quickly to get the heater out of their home before it exploded in a huge fireball A couple issued a warning about the dangers of buying gas heaters on eBay after their attempts to save money on heating bills led to disaster.  Sharon and Ray Baines had to act quickly to get their new heater out of their home before it exploded ""like a bomb"" and sent a ""fireball"" into the sky.  Luckily, the couple's evasive action limited the damage to their home in Blurton, Stoke-on-Trent, but firefighters said if it hadn't been for their quick thinking the heater could have ""taken the roof off"".  The incident took place on Tuesday morning, while 68-year-old Ray had been taking the dog for a walk. He had turned on the new stove to warm the house up for when Sharon came downstairs, but upon his return at about 7.30am, he noticed that the flames had climbed much higher than they should have been.   Ray was able to drag the appliance into the back garden and attempted to put out the growing flames with a hose. The couple quickly called the fire brigade and alerted their neighbours to the fire, but the propane canister then exploded outside the property, just meters away from where people were standing. The terrifying blast was captured on CCTV as it sent a bright fireball up into the air. Explaining the incident, Sharon told Stoke on Trent Live: ""It was a new one I'd bought off eBay, we had one of those self-fill bottles. We'd filled it up two or three times so nothing was wrong with that.  ""My husband got up to walk the dog, I was still in bed. He switched it on and let the dogs out, and came back to find the gas wasn't on.  ""We noticed that the flames at the front of the fire were getting higher and higher. He realised that the flames were getting worse, and picked it up and took it to the back door. ""He ran back in shouting to call the fire brigade. I dialled 999 and knocked on the neighbours. We were all at the front and there was a massive explosion. A fireball came over the top of the house.""  The huge blast caused damage to the outside of the property, but the couple believes it could have been much worse. Sharon added: ""There was metal from the fire, it ended up at the front of the house. The fire service said if it had been indoors it would have taken the roof off. We were very lucky. ""We had fire inspectors round to look. We'll never know the truth but he thinks it was a faulty fire. ""We'll need three new windows, fence panels, and the back door but it could have been a hell of a lot worse."" Sharon and Ray had purchased the heater from an eBay seller for £109.99 hoping to save money on their costly heating bills. ""We're getting £400 or £500 bills, we only switch on the central heating when we go to have a bath. We haven't had that on and the bills are still coming in,"" Sharon said. But the couple has now warned others to think twice about purchasing a similar heater from eBay after the dangerous incident.

8 bills you need to check now to save money - from broadband to council tax and mortgage,"Mirror Money editor Levi Winchester goes through your monthly payments bill by bill to explain how you can save money through comparing prices, haggling, and taking advantage of all the help availableIt feels like just about everything is rising in price - but there are things you can do to cut your costs.  From your broadband to council tax and your mortgage, we go through your monthly payments bill by bill and explain how to save money.  It could be through comparing prices and haggling, or just knowing what schemes to take advantage of that could slash your spending.  Being organised is key, so start by going through your bank statements and noting down when all your payments are due.  Once you have an idea of how much you're spending, cutting costs becomes a lot simpler.    Broadband  If you’re out of contract, chances are you’re paying too much for your broadband. Compare prices elsewhere using a comparison website to see if you can get a better deal.  Make sure you take note of how much speed you actually need, as you could save money if you're able to reduce your package.  Don’t want to switch elsewhere? Talk to your current provider, explain the prices you’ve seen elsewhere and try to haggle them down. Do keep in mind that if you’re in contract, you may be charged an exit fee for switching. If you claim certain benefits, you might be eligible for a social broadband tariff, which are typically cheaper than regular deals.  TalkTalk offers free broadband for six months for jobseekers on Universal Credit, at the discretion of your local JobCentre.  Elsewhere, the cheapest social tariff starts at £12 from Vodafone.  Mobile  The same principle applies to your mobile bill - compare prices, then either switch elsewhere or haggle. Again, you might have an exit penalty if you move to another provider mid-contract - which can mean paying off the remainder of your current deal. The cheapest phone tariffs are typically SIM-only deals. This is because you're only paying for your minutes, data, texts and any other allowances - not the handset. When comparing prices, go back and see how many minutes and data you're using in your current deal so you know what type of package you need.    Insurance  If you've got an insurance policy due for renewal - whether it be car or home insurance - make a note in your diary to start comparing prices.  MoneySavingExpert says 23 days before your car insurance is due to expire is the prime time to find the cheapest deals.  For home insurance, compare prices 21 days before. Again, if you're happy with your current provider but you've seen a better deal elsewhere, try calling them up and haggling down the price.  Subscriptions   Chances are you're signed up to lots of subscription services and memberships - from Amazon and Netflix to your gym - but how many of these do you actually use?  Go through your bank statements and look for any regular payments, then ask yourself if you can do without that product. If you pay monthly, you should be able to cancel that service immediately and the payments will stop. If you've made an annual payment, you sometimes might be able to get a refund on the months you have remaining. Read the terms and conditions carefully to check your rights when it comes to cancelling.  Council tax  It is well worth checking if you're paying too much on your council tax - either through being placed in too high of a band, or by missing out on discounts. It is possible to challenge your council tax, if you suspect you're in the wrong band. But you need to do your research first - if it turns out you're in too low of a band, your bills will be pushed up and this could also affect your neighbours.  See more information on challenging your council tax band here.  There are also lots of different scenarios where you could be entitled to a discount of up to 100% off your council tax bill. For example, you could get 25% off if you live alone, or 50% if everyone living in your household is disregarded from paying. A 100% discount could be awarded to someone with a ""severe mental impairment"" living alone, or an all-student household. You may also be eligible for up to 100% off your bill if you qualify for Council Tax Support (sometimes called Council Tax Reduction) if you're on a low income or certain benefits.  Energy Households are currently covered by the Energy Price Guarantee, which has ""frozen"" energy bills for the typical family at £2,500 a year. But this isn't a total cap on what you could pay. Much like the Ofgem price cap, the guarantee limits what you can be charged for unit rates of gas and electricity. This means if you use more energy, you'll pay more - use less, and your bill will be lower. There are currently no fixed tariffs that will save you money. This means the best way to lower your energy bill is to use less energy. This can be through simple measures like turning your thermostat down - British Gas says this can save you £115 a year on average - or turning off appliances from standby. You should also make sure your home is as well insulated as possible. Easy ways to do this include buying rugs if you have floorboards, or making your own draught excluder. Finally, check you're receiving all the energy help that is available to you.  For example, there is a £400 rebate, being handed out in six instalments until April. You need to physically claim this if you're a prepayment customer. Other schemes include the Warm Home Discount, worth £150, Cold Weather Payments, worth £25 each, and Winter Fuel Payments, worth up to £600. Many energy providers also offer free cash grants that you don't need to pay back. British Gas runs a hardship fund for anyone - not just its customers - where you could get £1,500.  Water You can't switch water providers - but that doesn't mean you can't save money on your bill. The most obvious way to do this, is to use less water. For example, you could reduce your shower time by just one minute. You could also research water meters, to see if this would help you save money. Martin Lewis suggests, as a general rule of thumb, that you could save cash if you have more or the same number of bedrooms in your house than people. Use the free calculator on the Consumer Council for Water website to check if you'd benefit from a water meter. Households can also bag a range of free water-saving devices through Save Water Save Money. The gadgets include shower heads which help regulate water usage, tap inserts to regulate water flow, and cistern bags, so each flush uses less water. Mortgage Mortgage costs have shot up this last year, due to nine consecutive interest rate rises from the Bank of England.  To put this into perspective, the average interest on a two-year fixed contract has surged from just over 2% to 5.75% since December 2021. If you've got a fixed rate deal that is about to expire, you'll face a huge increase in your repayments when you come to remortgage due to how much deals have risen by. When your fixed rate ends, you'll roll on to your lender's standard variable rate (SVR) - these are normally more expensive - unless you fix into another deal. Some lenders let you lock in a rate six months in advance - and many more let you lock in three months ahead.  There are many factors to consider when fixing into a deal. For example, how long do you want to fix for? How big of a mortgage do you have? Speak to a broker to work out the best options for you.

Pub boss warns price of a pint could soar to £10 as business energy support is cut,"One pub boss warned that if brewers passed on the costs of their energy to consumers, British pub-goers could see the average price of a pint rise to above £10A pub chain boss has warned how the price of a pint could hit £10 if boozers pass on the price of energy to punters in the next year. Charlene Lyons, CEO of Black Sheep Brewery in Masham, North Yorkshire spoke on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning after the Government announced the next stage of energy support for UK businesses. The Government has confirmed it would provide £5.5billion in scaled back support to businesses, companies, charities and other public sector groups from April 2023 until April 2024 to help with high costs.  The package is around six times less generous than the help in place today, sparking criticism from hospitality industry bosses who say UK businesses with a £4.5billion hike in energy bills. It is feared many businesses would not be able to sustain the increase.   Charlene told the BBC the support offered was “disappointing” and said the sector was suffering from sharply rising costs. She claimed brewers like hers would be forced to absorb many of the price rises. She said: “As a brewer, we've got to be really careful about price increases. “If we were to push all the price increases over to the consumer, energy, input costs like raw materials, everything, over to the consumer you'd be talking about charging over £10 a pint which is clearly not sustainable.” Charlene explained that this was something that she did not want to happen and that there was ""more negotiation to have"" over what costs can be passed onto customers.  The Black Sheep Brewery boss said her business would receive more generous help due to its status as an “energy-intensive business”, although the chain's five pubs sites would lose out.  She added: “Let's be absolutely clear, even the benefit for high-energy usage businesses still isn't a great offer. “You're talking about the best part of a £200,000 increase in energy bills per annum. And that's not sustainable for businesses, including our own.” With the announcement, Charlene says her business now has the ability to plan but as her business caters to the pub industry, which is also being affected by energy costs, it was going to be hard.  She noted that many hospitality venues have made the decision to have shorter opening hours which will affect the money it, and in turn, the brewer can make.   Under the new plan, all eligible non-domestic customers who have a contract with a licensed energy supplier will see a unit discount of up to £6.97 per megawatt hour automatically applied to their gas bill. A unit discount of up to £19.61/MWh applied to their electricity bill.  UKHospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said that while she was “relieved” new support had been introduced, UK hospitality businesses face an unsustainable jump in energy bills this year She said: “Our analysis shows the new, lower level of support will see a total £4.5bn hike in bills for the sector compared to the previous scheme. “This will simply be unsustainable for many.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/pub-boss-warns-price-pint-28917108
Martin Lewis issues warning to everyone paying a broadband bill ahead of huge price rises,"Martin Lewis explained how telecoms firms could be set to bring in mid-contract broadband price rises equivalent to an increase of 15% this April - but there are ways to slash your costsMartin Lewis has issued a warning to everyone in charge of paying a broadband bill ahead of huge price rises expected this spring. The MoneySavingExpert explained how telecom firms could be set to bring in mid-contract price rises equivalent to an increase of 15%. Many companies hike bills by the rate of Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation or Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation, plus roughly another 4% on top. It means families who are already struggling under the cost of living crisis face a huge increase on their internet bill, if price rises are brought in.  Martin explained during his ITV Money Show this evening: “If they enact them this year, and the likelihood is they will, this could mean 15%ish hikes this spring.    “This usually happens in April for most of the major broadband providers, which is going to be another hit for many people. “If you’re paying £40, that’s £6 a month extra. Even switchers’ deals will probably do this but of course, it’s £6 a month extra on £40 or if you pay £20 a month, it’s only £3 a month extra.” To help lower your costs, Martin urged households to check if they can slash their broadband bills now.  Roughly seven million people are out of contract and are likely paying too much for their internet - as the best deals are typically for new customers. If you're out of contract, Martin first suggested checking prices elsewhere to see what other deals are available. Next, call up your current provider and see if you can haggle them down to match the best price you've seen with another company.  A recent MoneySavingExpert poll revealed an over 75% success rate when haggling with TalkTalk, Virgin and Sky, plus “high success rates at many other broadband providers too”. “Switching... don’t worry about it too much - I can’t promise it will be smooth every time - it’s only two hours-ish of downtime,” he urged. “It’s your new firm who sorts it out for you and they’ll cancel your old provider. Some of you… don’t want to switch, you like where you are, in which case: haggle.” Martin continued: “As a loyal customer, the first thing I would do is, I’d get on the phone and I’d say: I’ve seen what you’re charging new customers. “I’d make sure you’ve seen what other providers are charging in your area, because it’s postcode dependent… and say I’m not willing to pay that amount, can you offer me a better deal? “If they say no… you say I want to go through to customer disconnections… this is where they can do the big deals. “Always be polite and if they don’t give you that price, I would be pretty annoyed and I’d want to ditch and switch and go elsewhere.”  Martin later highlighted some of the cheapest deals right now that are available through comparison websites. For example, Shell Energy is offering 11Mb broadband for £18.99 a month, or speeds of 38Mb for £21.99 a month. You then get one month bill credit free with the cheaper deal, plus a £30 Amazon voucher if you go for the higher speed.  Martin also flagged an offer from Vodafone, which is advertising 67Mb broadband for £22 a month, and you get a £105 voucher for Amazon, Tesco, Sainsbury's or M&S.

Missing Nicola Bulley's partner says she 'vanished into thin air' in 'impossible dream',"It has been one week since Nicola Bulley 45, disappeared while walking her brown spaniel Willow along the River Wyre in the tight-knit village of St Michael's-on-Wyre in LancashireThe devastated partner of missing Nicola Bulley has said he can't wrap is his head around her disappearance and that it's like an ""impossible dream"".  It has been one week since the mortgage adviser, 45, disappeared while walking her brown spaniel Willow along the River Wyre in the tight-knit village of St Michael's-on-Wyre in Lancashire.  The alarm was raised when someone recognised Nicola's dog running loose and found its harness and the mum's mobile phone nearby. They phoned her daughters' school who then contacted her partner Paul Ansell. Speaking publicly for the first time, Paul told Sky: ""I don't know how I am coping. I don't want to think about that. I am just focused on the girls.""   He said: ""It's a week on as yet it seems like we are no further on. It just seems impossible like a dream. ""Every single scenario comes to a brick wall. Every single one of them. All we are doing is sitting there going round and round and round through each scenario."" He added he was focusing on looking after their two daughters and ""didn't want to think"" about how he was coping.  Speaking about the public support, he said: ""It's amazing - it's the only thing we can take. it gives us a great amount of comfort. ""We're never gonna lose hope, of course, we are not. Right now it's like she vanished into thin air. It's just insane."" Nicola's disappearance has gripped the nation as seven days on it appears there are no leads into finding out what happened.  He had previously told pals he's trying to hold it together for their daughters, aged nine and six, who ""want to go out and find mummy"".  The family friend, who did not want to be named, told The Mirror: ""I am speaking to him most days. They are close friends of ours.  ""He’s trying to be strong for the girls. They want to go out and find mummy. It’s utterly heartbreaking. He’s trying to hold on to hope that she will be found and brought home to them.  ""He’s trying to balance keeping some form of routine for the girls and then trying to find Nikki. They just desperately want her home."" ""The alternative is just too unimaginable and devastating."" Yesterday, search efforts ramped up as divers were seen going into the river. Lancashire Police also appealed for a second potential key witness to come forward, who was later identified but said she hadn't seen Nicola that morning.   Nicola was last seen shortly after dropping her daughters off at school and taking her dog for a walk.  The dog was later found wandering alone ""bone dry"" and agitated on the trail with her harness on the floor, while Nicola’s phone had been left on a bench overlooking the water, still logged into the call.   Minutes before the meeting, during which she had switched off her camera and microphone, it is understood she texted a friend about meeting up sometime this week with her kids.  Two fellow dog walkers are said to have seen her soon before her disappearance and she was ""laughing and joking"" with them. Friends and family have said Nicola's disappearance was totally out of character. It comes after Nicola's mum Dot told the Mirror this week she had also been making plans for a spa break with her sister Louise. Dad Ernest added Nicola was happy with her job and had a meeting with an important client before she went missing.  Nicola is described as white, 5ft 3ins tall, with light brown shoulder-length hair. She speaks with an Essex accent. She was last seen wearing a long black gilet jacket with a hood, black jeans and olive-green ankle wellies. Her hair was tied into a ponytail. Anybody who has seen Nicola, or has information about where she might be, is asked to call 101, quoting log 565 of January 30th. For immediate sightings please call 999.

The handyman ""lived"" for his two sons Riley, 11, and Alfie 10, and used to joke with them that he was famous as his work meant that he ""knew everybody."" Amy said: ""Mike was a hard-working gentle soul who did everything to provide for his two boys. He would do anything to help anyone if he could. He ran his own handyman business for the last four years which was a huge success and he was so proud.   ""Mike's biggest passion in life after being a family man was rugby, he played from being young starting at Grappenhall Griffins, eventually settling at his home Woolston Rovers.  ""He did have to stop playing due to an injury, but would get his boots out every so often for charity matches [and] then not be able to walk for a week.  The heartbroken family told the Liverpool Echo that they had been touched by the outpouring of support for them as a community of people rallied behind them following the tragic news.

At the time of writing, £7,670 has been raised for the family as ""both Amy and Mike are self-employed, therefore will not receive bereavement pay."" Close friend Richard Potts, added: ""I knew Mike through rugby and work. Even though he's a little older than me he took me under his wing and did loads together. ""He did anything I ever asked of him, helped when I was down, skint, needed work, or just a pint - that would turn into several. Absolute beast of a bloke, one of my best friends and he is a fabulous father, hubby and did everything for his family and friends.""

Drunk Ryanair passenger downed brandy 'to calm nerves' and smashed glass on flight,"Stephen Stokes had been about to fly to Birmingham Airport from Faro, Portugal, aboard a Ryanair flight when he downed several glasses of brandy and was aggressive to cabin crewA nervous flyer who downed half a bottle of brandy before flying got aggressive towards members of the cabin crew and smashed a glass in a rage. Stephen Stokes, 58, was returning from a holiday in Faro, Portugal, when he lost his medication to help his mental health. Instead he drank half a bottle of brandy and then during the flight to Birmingham Airport became aggressive and smashed a glass. Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard the captain on the flight had considered diverting the flight because of Stokes’ behaviour, but continued on. He pleaded guilty to being drunk on an aircraft.   Ekene Pruce, prosecuting, said: ""He was observed to have consumed a half a bottle of brandy, which was 500ml, and he had become verbally aggressive towards the crew and was repeatedly told by the air crew not to be loud and aggressive. He also smashed a glass. ""The captain considered diverting the flight however reconsidered and landed at the destination. “Officers came aboard and removed the defendant in an intoxicated state."" Phillip Haycock, mitigating, explained Stokes lost his mental health medication prior to leaving, but thought he would be able to board the plane because it was a short flight.  He added: ""He bought alcohol, not for himself as he doesn't ordinarily drink. He's a solitary individual and keeps himself to himself. He bought it as a present for his mother. ""However when at the airport just as he was about to board he became quite ill and took a few sips of the brandy. He thought it would calm his nerves however that didn't do the trick. ""Regrettably he must have been drinking from it whilst on the flight. He has very, very little recollection of the incident on the plane. He remembers breaking the glass. It slipped from his hand. It wasn't a case of him throwing it."" ""He has apologised unreservedly to the company and I suppose he's been banned from future flights. I don't think he will be travelling on airlines in the future because of his difficulties. ""He is ashamed of his behaviour. He has tried to keep it to himself. He doesn't want to bring this to the attention of his family.""   After deliberating for several minutes the magistrates ruled to impose a fine, despite warning Stokes that similar cases have warranted jail sentences. The chair of the bench said: ""This offence was of a serious nature. It was in a confined space, you were aggressive and we are sure other passengers would have been concerned. ""The cabin crew were also concerned about your behaviour and to the extent they had to contact the captain to see if the flight needed to be diverted. “On an aircraft you have got to consider the safety of every passenger."" He was hit with a £400 fine, £185 costs and £160 victim surcharge. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/drunk-ryanair-passenger-downed-brandy-29123305
Tory election chief's own firm admits Britain's 'economic misery made worse' by ministers,"Millionaire banker Stephen Massey has taken over the running of the Conservative Party's local election campaign. His City firm warned Britain is facing 'insipid growth' under this governmentThe Tory election chief’s own company admitted Britain’s “economic misery” has been “made worse by our politicians”. Stephen Massey has taken over the duties of the Conservative Party Chairman following the sacking of Nadhim Zahawi. The millionaire banker will run the Tory local election campaign. But now it has emerged the City firm where he continues to work on the side as chairman has issued a warning about the competence of the government. In a scathing note to investors, it said the country, which has been under Tory rule for 13 years, has “big issues” that will lead to “insipid growth”. An investment outlook by Canaccord Genuity for the coming year said: “The easiest region to discuss is the UK and Europe, both of which have big issues, made worse by our politicians and our structural weaknesses… we should prepare ourselves for a prolonged period of insipid growth.   Rishi Sunak appointed Mr Massey as Conservative Party chief executive in November. He also has been handed the responsibilities of the Party Chairman on an interim basis after Mr Zahawi was found to have not told the truth about an HMRC investigation he faced for not paying enough tax. Mr Massey remains chairman of Canaccord Genuity, the wealth management firm where he has worked for the past decade. On its website, it boasts that it helps its rich clients invest ""in the most tax-efficient manner"". Mr Massey has donated £343,000 to the Tories including £25,000 to Mr Sunak’s leadership campaign. Earlier this week, the Mirror revealed that clients of Canaccord Genuity had launched legal action against the company in 2019 after it advised them to put their money into a film investment scheme that was targeted by the taxman. They complained that an HMRC crackdown had left them with huge bills. A spokesman for Mr Massey has insisted he had “no involvement in the advice related to this case, which arose in a company acquired by Canaccord before he was employed by the firm”. Mr Massey has donated £343,000 to the Tories including £25,000 to Mr Sunak’s leadership campaign. * Follow Mirror Politics on Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter and Facebook.

Nicola Bulley's partner issues heartbreaking statement as hunt for missing mum continues,"Nicola Bulley's partner Paul Ansell is pleading for answers in the woman's disappearance and said that her daughters 'miss mummy desperately'. Nicola went missing on January 27The partner of Nicola Bulley is pleading for answers as the search for the missing mum continues. The 45-year-old disappeared on January 27 in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, and since then police have been constantly looking for her. Nicola had dropped her two daughters, aged six and nine, off at school and then went on her usual dog walk alongside the river. Her phone, still connected to a Teams call for her job as a mortgage adviser, was found on a bench on a steep riverbank overlooking the water, along with the dog lead, with the dog harness on the ground. Officers believe that Nicola fell into the river, but since there is nothing to confirm this theory so far, they said they remain open-minded.   Today, the police were joined by a search team from Specialist Group International (SGI) led by forensic search specialist Peter Faulding. In a new statement released through Lancashire Police today, Nicola's partner Paul Ansell said everyone is desperate to know what happened to her. He added that Nicola's daughters ""miss their mummy desperately"" and have been going through ""a tough time"" since her disappearance.  Mr Ansell said: ""It's been ten days now since Nicola went missing and I have two little girls who miss their mummy desperately and who need her back. ""This has been such a tough time for the girls especially but also for me and all of Nicola’s family and friends, as well as the wider community and I want to thank them for their love and support. ""We are also really grateful to Peter and his team from SGI for coming up and helping support the work of Lancashire Police as they continue their investigation.  ""If anyone has any information which could help find Nicola, I urge them to get in touch with the police and help us provide the answers we all so badly need."" Speaking to Sky News, Mr Ansell said: ""We have to find her safe and well. I can't put those girls to bed again tonight with no answers."" It comes as police released CCTV images of Nicola on her Ring Doorbell before she went missing.  Lancashire Police said: ""Nicola was last seen on Friday morning (January 27th) at around 9.20am on the upper field by the river off Garstang Road where she had taken her Spaniel Willow for a walk after dropping her children at school in the village. ""Our CCTV enquiries have focused on Nicola’s movements and whether she could have left the fields near to the river, whether that be via Allotment Lane, the river path leading to Garstang Road, or by Rowanwater at the top of the upper field.  ""Most of our sightings of Nicola have been by witnesses who knew her and that has enabled us to plot her movements from the school, along the river path and into the field.  ""We can say with confidence that by reviewing CCTV, Nicola has not left the field during the key times via Rowanwater, either through the site itself or via the piece of land at the side.  ""Also, we can say that she did not return from the fields along Allotment Lane or via the path at the rear of the Grapes pub onto Garstang Road.   ""Our enquiries now focus on the river path which leads from the fields back to Garstang Road – for that we need drivers and cyclists who travelled that way on the morning of January 27 to make contact. We have already done a lot of work around this, but every piece of footage helps us build up a picture of movements on that morning."" Detective Supt Rebecca Smith said: ""The team working on this investigation are completely dedicated and determined to find Nicola.  ""As a mother myself, I can't even begin to imagine what her two children are going through.   ""Please be reassured that our sole focus is Nicola and that we are doing everything we can to find her.  ""It is not possible to provide every piece of information to the public because to do so would detract from the investigation, but I’d like to thank everyone who has assisted us so far and for the support provided to Nicola’s family at this extremely difficult time.   ""They are being supported and updated throughout. I would ask that anyone who was driving/cycling through St Michael’s last Friday morning and who has dashcam footage to get in touch with us if they haven’t already done so.  ""I would also ask in fisherman who may have been in the area at the time to make contact if you feel you can assist.  ""I would also appeal again to anyone who has any other footage – CCTV or Ring Doorbell for example, or any other information, no matter how insignificant you might think it is, to contact us as every small piece can help us build up a picture.""

Police rapist David Carrick told victim he was 'safest person' before sex attack,"WARNING: DISTRESSING CONTENT Today was the first of a two-day sentencing hearing for David Carrick at Southwark Crown Court in London -it was said Carrick carried out a 'catalogue of violent and brutal sexual offences… on multiple victims'A former Metropolitan Police officer told one of his victims he was “the safest person that she could be with” before he raped her.  David Carrick, 48, was unmasked as one of Britain's most prolific sex offenders after he admitted to 24 counts of rape as well as charges of sexual assault, controlling and coercive behaviour and false imprisonment.   Today was the first of a two-day sentencing hearing at Southwark Crown Court in London. This morning the court heard how Carrick carried out a “catalogue of violent and brutal sexual offences… on multiple victims”.   Prosecutor Tom Little KC, opening the case at Southwark Crown Court on Monday, began by listing all the charges Carrick has admitted.   Mr Little told the court about a victim who had been told by Carrick that he was ""the safest person that she could be with"" before raping her. Speaking about the victim’s ordeal, Mr Little said: “He asked her to sit beside him. She said no. “He then got up and went to kiss her and again she said no. She told him that she wasn’t interested. He apologised and said sorry. “They spoke for a while and then she said that she was going to go. She went for the door and tried to open it but she couldn’t do it.  “The defendant told (his victim) that she could not go. He grabbed her by the hair and put his hand round her mouth and dragged her backwards.” Mr Little said Carrick held a black handgun to a victim’s head before telling her “you are not going” as he raped her. Mr Little told the court: “She froze. The prosecution does not contend that it was a real firearm. (The victim) couldn’t say whether it was or not.” Serial rapist Carrick told one victim he would be the “last thing she saw” as he put his hands around her throat, a court heard. Speaking about the rape, prosecutor Mr Little said: “It carried on for some time. “He put his hands around her throat and said he was going to be the last thing she saw.”  One of Carrick's victims was told by an A&E nurse that if she complained it ""might not go to court"". Mr Little said the woman attended King’s College Hospital with external and internal injuries after being raped by Carrick. Mr Little said: “She was asked who had raped her and she told the nurse that it was a police officer. “(The victim) told the police that the nurse in A&E told her that she needed to be ready if she was going to complain about it and that even if she did it might not go to court. “She said as she was young, she might be better to try to put it behind her and move on. “As a result, (the victim) did not report the matter to the police at the time.” Carrick remained emotionless with his head bowed and eye closed while Mr LIttle recounted his horrific crimes. Carrick sent a photograph of himself with a work-issue firearm to one of his victims, saying “remember I am the boss”, a court heard.  Mr Little KC told Southwark Crown Court: “He told her that she belonged to him and the she must obey him. “He threatened her with his police baton and sent her a photograph of his work-issue firearm saying ‘remember I am the boss’. “He told her that she should obey him and that, if she did, he would give her an amazing life.” Mr Little told the court about another one of his victims being shut under a cupboard under the stairs. He said Carrick would force her to strip naked and go into the cupboard where he would be on the other side of the door and ""whistle at her as if she was a dog"". Assistant Commissioner Barbara Gray said these next two days would provide more detail about Carrick's ""cruel and abusive"" offences. It later emerged that the Met was informed of nine incidents - including allegations of rape, domestic violence and harassment - between 2000 and 2021. Carrick, who joined the force in 2001 before becoming an armed officer with the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command in 2009, faced no criminal sanctions or misconduct findings. Police chiefs across England and Wales have since been asked to have all officers checked against national police databases by the end of March. Carrick, who served in the Army before joining the Met, admitted 49 criminal charges, but some of the attacks are multiple incident counts, meaning they relate to more than 80 sexual offences, including at least 48 rapes against 12 women. He will also be sentenced to nine counts of sexual assault, five counts of assault by penetration, three counts of coercive and controlling behaviour, and three counts of false imprisonment. Carrick's offences also include two counts of attempted rape, one count of attempted sexual assault by penetration, one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent, and one count of indecent assault. He denied a further count of rape in September 2020 relating to a 13th woman, whose allegation triggered the investigation, and the Crown Prosecution Service decided it was not in the public interest to proceed to trial on the charge. Carrick's crimes are set to form part of the independent inquiry looking at the murder of Sarah Everard, who was raped and strangled to death by then-serving Met officer Wayne Couzens in March 2021.

Expert dive squad say if missing Nicola Bulley is in river 'we'll find her in minutes',"Peter Faulding, founder of Specialist Group International, has offered his services to Lancashire Police for free in the search for Nicola Bulley The head of an expert underwater forensics team drafted into the search for Nicola Bulley says if she drowned in the River Wyre his sonar will likely find her “immediately”.  Peter Faulding, founder of Specialist Group International, has offered his services to Lancashire Police for free. The 45-year-old mum disappeared on a dog walk in St Michaels on Wyre on January 27. Her springer spaniel Willow was found wandering along the route near a bench where her owner's phone had been left, overlooking the water. Surrey-based SGI - which normally charges around £4,000 a day - will be launching its ‘top of the market’ 18,000khz side scan sonar later this morning. Mr Faulding believes if Nicola went into the river and drowned she would have likely got ""snagged"" within around 500 metres of the point of entry.   Mr Faulding told the Mirror: “If Nicola is in there, we will find her. If she’s there, our sonar will pick her up straight away. “I will see a body on the bottom. We are dealing with about 10 drownings every summer. We always locate within the hour. It’s that quick, it’s that good. “Nicola wouldn’t have gone far if she was in this river because it’s got shallows and she would get lodged. There’s no way she would have gone out to the estuary.  ""The river’s not in flood, it’s benign.”  Mr Faulding said if Nicola fell into the river and was conscious, cold water shock could have “taken her breath away” and her energy would have been sapped meaning she would eventually drown. It would then take a few days for a body to resurface as it decomposes, unless it is caught on something. But he said if she was fit and healthy and a reasonable swimmer, she could have pulled herself out, if not at the point of entry further down the bank.  ""She wouldn’t have been dragged down, no way,” he continued. ""There is apparently quite a deep pool in the middle there.  ""She wouldn’t have been swept away, the clothing she was wearing, it wasn’t heavy wool so it wouldn’t absorb water so quickly as normal clothing.""  Mr Faulding said the police likely do have similar sonar but it probably isn't as powerful as his team's and they likely don't have the same level of expertise and personnel to focus on using it. Explaining how the equipment works, he said: ""The sonar will highlight every stick and stone on the bottom.  ""It’s as good as that.   ""As I tow it along I get a picture on the screen in front of me. ""The sound wave gets sent across the river bed and then that data gets picked up and comes back and is analysed by the computer, and I can actually measure how long a target is. We can then put a diver in to confirm that target."" However, Mr Faulding is not convinced Nicola is in the water.  “She could have potentially floated and also there were no screams heard or anything,"" he said. “Normally people would scream out and I don’t know if there was other people in the area but you’d scream out, you’d flap around and the dog would normally maybe stay with the owner. There’s something, in my opinion, not quite right here.” Mr Faulding said if Nicola has drowned and her body was carried further down the river, his team can cover around 10 miles a day with the sonar. SGI normally cover all diving operations for the police in the south-east of England, except for London. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/expert-dive-squad-say-missing-29142671
"Turkey and Syria earthquake: 3,400 killed after huge 7.8 magnitude quake","A 7.8 magnitude earthquake in Turkey and Syria has left over two thousand people dead and reduced buildings to rubble, with shocks felt throughout the Middle East - followed by another shake of 7.5 magnitudeA powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit southern Turkey and northern Syria early Monday, razing buildings to the ground and killing at least 3,400 people and wounding 12,208 with many more trapped in the rubble. Another massive shake with a magnitude of 7.5 hit Turkey’s south hours after the original quake.  Latest figures from Turkey's disaster agency show 1,651 fatalities have been recorded and in Syria, two figures have been released - one for government-held areas and another for opposition-held areas. The number of wounded is now 11,119 in Turkey and 1,089 in Syria. People were left trapped and injured in several areas in the countries as it hit while they were sleeping. Tremors were felt as far as Cyprus, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon and Egypt, prompting Italy to issue a tsunami alert for coastal populations.   Most of the damage is in southern Turkey and northern and central Syria and the death toll is expected to grow as casualty reports come in from individual provinces. Multiple aftershocks have continued to be reported throughout the morning both in Syria and Turkey but also in Iraq and Lebanon, with hundreds of buildings damaged forcing residents to pour outside on a cold winter night.   Syria has been devastated by more than 11 years of civil war, plus an economic and Covid-19 crisis. Many of the victims were living in squalid conditions and with little access to healthcare.  The epicentre of the first earthquake was near the city of Gaziantep, about 60 miles from the Syrian border. Along with several cities, the area is home to home to millions of Syrian refugees who fled their country's long-running civil war. Turkey, which borders Syria to the north, hosts the largest number of Syrian refugees in the world. Thousands of people have fled Syrian dictator Assad's brutal bombardment and are now suffering through an enormous earthquake in the middle of winter.  “Unfortunately, at the same time, we are also struggling with extremely severe weather conditions,” Vice President Fuat Otkay told reporters.  Nearly 2,800 search and rescue teams have been deployed in the disaster-stricken areas, he said. Europe’s politicians are now waking woke up to the news, offering assistance as well as condolences.  The British Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly, has said that his country stands by ready to help, tweeting: ""Tragic loss of life in the Turkey and Syria earthquake. Our condolences go to the families of those who died and our thoughts are with the survivors. The UK stands ready to provide assistance."" The British Government also announced its deploying 76 search and rescue specialists, including four trained dogs.   The last time a quake of that power shook Turkey was in 1939 when close to 33,000 were killed.  Turkey's top earthquake scientist has described the earthquake as the biggest in over two decades: ""We are facing the biggest earthquake in 24 years in this part of the world,"" Dr Haluk Ozener, director of the earthquake research centre at Istanbul's Bogazici University, said in a statement on Monday. ""It was felt across our borders in Turkey, Northern Cyprus, Iraq and Syria and led to the loss of life in some places. So far, 100 aftershocks have occurred"", he continued.  He said he expected the aftershocks to continue in the coming days with a decreased intensity but warned that ""these earthquakes can last up to a year."" Risklayer, a German independent research group on natural disasters, say its modelling suggests the death toll could be in the tens of thousands. It said that based on the current situation the toll was likely to be around 16,800. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Twitter that ""search and rescue teams were immediately dispatched"" to the areas hit by the quake.  In northwest Syria, the opposition's Syrian Civil Defense described the situation in the rebel-held region as ""disastrous"" adding that entire buildings have collapsed and people are trapped under the rubble. One orphanage was completely destroyed in Sarmada in northern Syria. One orphan was killed, five are injured and 50 survived. Footage from Malatya in southern Turkey appeared to show a large building completely reduced to rubble in the aftermath, with multiple people heard calling out across the wreckage.  The city of 800,000 people is thought to have been one of the worst hit so far by the earthquake, with local reports suggesting the Avşar Hotel had been severely damaged. In the Turkish city of Adana, one resident said three buildings near his home collapsed.  “I don’t have the strength anymore,” another survivor could be heard calling out from beneath the rubble.  Reporters on the ground describe rescue workers and residents using flashlights while searching through piles of tangled metal and concrete rubble in one of the stricken cities. People on the street shouted up to others inside a partially toppled apartment building, leaning dangerously.  The quake jolted residents in Lebanon from their beds, shaking buildings for about 40 seconds. Many residents of Beirut left their homes and took to the streets or drove in their cars away from buildings. Turkey sits on top of major fault lines and is frequently shaken by earthquakes, but this is the biggest one to hit in decades. Some 18,000 were killed in powerful earthquakes that hit northwest Turkey in 1999. ""I have never felt anything like it in the 40 years I've lived,"" said Erdem, a resident of the Turkish city of Gaziantep. He continued: ""We were shaken at least three times very strongly, like a baby in a crib."" Buildings were reported collapsed from Syria’s cities of Aleppo and Hama to Turkey’s Diyarbakir, more than 200 miles to the northeast.   Nearly 900 buildings were destroyed in Turkey’s Gaziantep and Kahramanmaras provinces, said Otkay. A hospital collapsed in the Mediterranean coastal city of Iskanderoun, but casualties were not immediately known, he also said. Turkey's government initiated a 'level four' alert that called for international aid and dispatched rescue crews who were sifting through piles of debris to look for people trapped under hundreds of collapsed buildings.  Seismologists have blamed a lack of enforcement of building codes for high fatality rates in Turkish disasters.  The urban and environment minister Murat Kurum said last year that the country’s housing stock included 6.8 million homes that were “at risk” in an earthquake.

Turkey Syria earthquake: Dramatic footage shows building collapse after shake,"At least one seven storey building collapsed in the Haliliye district of Şanlıurfa province in Turkey during an aftershock of an enormous 7.8-magnitude earthquakeShocking footage from the aftermath of the earthquake in Turkey shows a high-rise building collapsing to the ground. At least one seven storey building collapsed in the Haliliye district of Şanlıurfa province during aftershock of a 7.8-magnitude earthquake, footage released by the local Urfa TV showed. It crashes to the ground in seconds with a huge rumbling crash, as people are heard shouting and running away.  The quake hit southern Turkey and northern Syria early Monday, killing at least 3,400 people and wounding 9,622 with many more trapped in the rubble. The number of wounded is now 8,533 in Turkey and 1,089 in Syria. The seven-story building was filmed from multiple angles as it collapsed during daylight hours. It is unknown if anyone was injured in the horrifying collapse shown in this footage.   Multiple videos from across Turkey show that many buildings are subject to the same horrors, with some commentators sharing their concerns over the building regulations which have allowed collapses to happen so easily. In another video, rescuers were seen working in the rubble at the base of tall buildings when metres away another one collapsed sending rubble flying through the air. Among the cities that were badly hit were Gaziantep, Malatya, Diyarbakir and Sanliurfa in Turkey and Aleppo and Idlib in Syria.  Sky News' verification team have found a large portion of a street in Kahramanmaras, Turkey, has been damaged and they estimate that at least 12 buildings in the video have collapsed. Comparing images from the site of the devastation with Google Maps images, they were able to analyse the vast scale of destruction on the street. ""While we were sleeping, the house started shaking; I immediately ran to my children; I did not know which one to carry; I could not reach the door, the distance was very far, and a minute of time was like years of helplessness and fear, and the fear continues with the aftershocks,"" a World Vision staff member in Northern Syria said to the press.  They continued: ""Most of the people are on the streets in the snow and rain, with many destroyed buildings, many victims, and many still trapped under the rubble."" Initial reports from the International Rescue Committee in Syria indicate that the impact has been devastating in areas that already host a high number of displaced and vulnerable families.  As the number of injured continues to rise there are very real concerns about the ability of an already decimated health system to cope inside Syria.  Following years of conflict, hospitals in northern Syria are overstretched as they grapple with a recent cholera outbreak.

"Neighbours' shock after headteacher, husband and daughter found dead on school grounds","Police were called to Epsom College, in Surrey, at 1am on Sunday morning, alerted by ambulance services, where they made the horrific discoveryNeighbours of tragic headteacher Emma Pattison say they are heartbroken by her death. Police were called to Epsom College, in Surrey, at 1am on Sunday morning, alerted by ambulance services, where they made the horrific discovery.  The bodies of Emma Pattison, 45, her daughter Lettie, seven, and her husband George, 39, were all found. She had only started as head of the top independent school in September and was discovered along with her husband George and their seven-year-old daughter Lettie. Security guards are now manning every entrance to £42,000-a-year Epsom College and police have so far not given a cause of death for the family. Today those living near her said they couldn’t fathom what had happened. Meanwhile parents whose children went to school with Mrs Pattison’s daughter Lettie say they are at a loss with what to tell them - with one linked to one of her classmates saying: “They don’t know how to explain it.”   Today, as cordons remain in place, buses are lined up preparing to take pupils home. It is understood the school cannot close because of the number of overseas pupils. Some could be seen going from lesson to lesson with their sports bags this afternoon. The Pattisons’ house near school buildings on the far left hand side of the college from the main entrance, is flanked by other staff accommodation. And those who live nearby are all struggling to make sense of what happened as speculation runs riot. So far all staff have replied “no comment” when asked whether they had anything to say on Mrs Pattison’s death. But neighbours of the Pattisons who don’t live on school grounds couldn’t believe what had occurred in the tight-knit community.  Juel Ahmed, 54, said: “It’s very shocking, very distressing for the community and the school. “I’m sure their families are going through shocking times.” Spiro Fernando, 49, former Head Boy at local Kingsford House school, added: “I was shocked. I have lived in Epsom all my life - this kind of thing is not what you expect to hear in Epsom. It’s a London news story. “I had a lot of friends who went to Epsom College so it’s really intertwined with my memories.”  A neighbour who did not wish to be named: “When I heard about the story it was really terrifying. What happened to them is really awful.” And another, who works for an education company not linked to Epsom College, added: “There is a lot of speculation as to what it was. There is shock, sadness, disbelief. “A friend of a friend’s daughter was at school with Lettie. They’re shocked. They’ve got to explain to the children what happened and they don’t know how to explain it.” A neighbour, whose daughter went to the school, said: “It’s just so sad and tragic. She left a while ago so I don’t know the headmistress but I have heard she was a really, really good headmistress.  “It’s a nice school. Apparently she was amazing and it’s a shock. The fact that it is a seven year old is just beyond me.” And former student and neighbour Sam, 27, added: “It’s very odd. It’s very hard to put into words. It’s a big part of my childhood and I’ve had mixed feelings of the school but it feels really strange. “It’s really sad with the little girl. It happened in a place where I spent five years of my life.” Katie, who lives with Sam, 27: “It’s so close to home. I am just sad for the family. The school is a safe space.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/neighbours-shock-after-headteacher-husband-29149834
"Social housing 'getting worse and worse' with cockroaches, mice, damp and mould, MPs hear","Housing activist Kwajo Tweneboa told MPs he went to one home where there was 'about an inch and a half deep of raw sewage' - as MPs grill the housing regulator about the death of Awaab Ishak that was caused by poisonous mouldProblems with social housing are getting ""worse and worse"", MPs were told today. Housing activist Kwajo Tweneboa said he receives messages “every day” and “every night” of “countless situations” where people are living in appalling conditions. Speaking to the housing committee, he told MPs: ""I've taken people to hospital I've had to take people to A&E because ceilings have collapsed on them. ""There's been damp, there's been mould, infestations of cockroaches. I've opened people's ovens and cockroaches crawling out, dead mice, ceilings collapse, homes flooded, ceilings missing - vulnerable children living in these conditions, vulnerable adults living in these conditions. ""I've been stood in one home where I was about an inch and a half deep in the raw sewage... All of these people reached out to me because they were ignored at multiple levels. ""But honestly the list could go on. Some of the things that I've seen have been described as not even fit for animals to live in, never mind human beings.""   Kwajo, who himself has lived in inhumane social housing conditions, said there has been an “influx this year”. He said the regulator needs to start “seriously” holding landlords and providers to account, adding that it “can’t just be a slap on the wrist” but needs to be proper penalties.  The housing campaigner, who has more than 70,000 followers on Twitter alone, said tenants aren't being listened to.  He said some have complained for as long as 10 years and aren't moved - yet as soon as he shames the housing provider on social media, people are moved out within 24 hours. “It goes to show it can happen but for some reason it takes shaming for that to happen and takes shaming by people with big social media platforms… if it was a social housing tenant, they'd simply just be ignored,” he said. MPs then grilled the regulator - who faced particular questioning over the housing association of a mould-covered property having been awarded the highest rating even though two-year-old Awaab Ishak had died after living there. Labour MP Clive Betts, who is chair of the housing committee, said the tragic death showed Rochdale Boroughwide Housing (RBH) ""clearly had major problems"".   He said: ""Six months after his death, you gave RBH’s governance the highest grade possible. That doesn’t look like a regulator on top of the job, really going for an organisation with a very poor record, an appalling record in this case."" Jonathan Walters, deputy chief executive of the Regulator of Social Housing, insisted they had to wait for the coroner's report, which did not end up coming until two years later, at the end of 2022. He said: ""We obviously knew the death had happened… it was important that we have the evidence from the coroner before we came to that conclusion."" Mr Betts pointed out that it was clear there were red flags, questioning how the official government body could have still awarded it the top rating after the death had taken place. He said: ""If it'd been a happier circumstances and that young boy hadn't died, you wouldn't have done anything at all because you wouldn’t have had a coroner's report to act on."" Mr Betts questioned whether the regulator had no concerns whatsoever about RBH. Mr Walters responded: ""I wouldn't say we had no concerns whatsoever"" and added: ""As far as we were aware, at the time, Rochdale borough wide housing was a well governed organisation that transpired not to be the case.""  At the end of 2022, a coroner ruled that Awaab's death had been caused by prolonged exposure to the toxic black mould in his home. Mr Walters added: ""We expect and we require all providers to be open and transparent and honest with us and where we have evidence of providers haven't been, as we did in Rochdale, it became became apparent after the coroner's report that the Rochdale had not been open and transparent with us... then we take that very seriously."" The regulator downgraded RBH in December, two years after Awaab's death. RBH finally surveyed other properties on the estate a few months before. They found that almost 80% of those had signs of damp and mould. The Mirror is campaigning for urgent action to end the housing hell experienced by millions of people. Across the country people are trapped in substandard homes - many of which pose a threat to health or life. Figures released just over a month ago found there are 3.4million homes that do not meet the Decent Homes Standard. This includes an estimated 2.2million properties that have at least one Category 1 hazard and 941,000 that have serious damp.

Retired couple found out they'd won £10k every month for a year after popping to shops,"Angela Hathorn and husband Steve, from Orpington in Kent, are still in shock after they matched all five main numbers in the Set For Life draw on Monday, January 23A retired school worker found out she'd bagged £10,000 every month for a year after popping to the supermarket.  Angela Hathorn, 63, is now planning a bucket list of experiences she wants to complete with 68-year-old husband Steve, including a cruise, luxury trips to London and visits to historical and heritage sites across the UK. The couple are still stunned after matching all five main numbers in the Set For Life draw on Monday, January 23. Angela said she was initially worried there was a problem with her ticket when she asked for it to be checked at her local shop in Orpington, Kent.   She said: “Every Sunday I buy my Set For Life tickets for the coming week and normally get both checked at the end of the week in the shop, I never check the numbers online. “Unusually, I went into the Co-op on the Tuesday and asked the lady to check the numbers for the Monday night draw.  ""She had a puzzled look on her face as she stared at The National Lottery terminal and then she asked her colleague to take a look. “I was starting to get nervous, worried there was a problem and not helped by a large queue behind me, before the shop assistant said they couldn’t pay out over £100, and I should go call the National Lottery line to claim my prize. “I didn’t even ask how much, I just went back to my car to drive home.” Angela was parked a few hundred yards from the Co-op and admits her knees buckled a few times on her way back to the car. She added: “I got home, and as usual Steve opened the door for me and immediately asked me what the matter was as I obviously didn’t look my normal self. ""I told him the story and so we sat down to call the number on the back of the Set For Life ticket.  “The man at The National Lottery told me that it sounded like I had won and that someone would be contacting me asap to confirm the win, and then I couldn’t stop saying, ‘oh my God, oh my God!’. ""Steve was by this time as white as a sheet! I did try to have some lunch but could only manage half a sandwich.” Angela and Steve called their two sons, James and Lee, to tell them their amazing news. Angela said: “I called James first as I knew he would be at home. I then called Lee when he got back from his work.  ""They didn’t believe me! I wasn't 100% sure myself and so we all just talked about various things with the conversation always eventually going back to the win. “I didn’t sleep for days, nervous it was still a dream and it was just amazing when everything was confirmed.” She added: “I’m not really into material things, but this fabulous win will help Steve and I enjoy life to the full.  ""As we are both retired we have the time so I want to go on a cruise, having watched lots of television programmes on this type of holiday.  ""I love going into London so I can see more visits for activities like afternoon tea on the horizon. And we love to visit historical and heritage sites. We did this a lot before Covid, and the win will kick start more trips for us.” Angela and retired design draughtsman Steve have been married for 41 years, and also plan to tend to their garden more. Angela said: “I love my garden, it’s an oasis…it’s a very special place for me so I think I’ll treat myself to some more plants.” The mum, who is retired from working with children with special educational needs at schools and nurseries, has been playing Set For Life since the game started in 2019. Set For Life is a National Lottery game that offers a top prize of £10K a month for 30 years when the five main numbers and the Life Ball are matched.  Players can win £10K a month for a whole year by matching the five main numbers.  Set For Life costs £1.50 per line to play and draws take place every Monday and Thursday.

"Man found guilty of murdering mum and daughter, 2, before burying bodies under floor","Andrew Innes, 52, was found guilty by a jury of murdering Bennylyn Burke, 25, and two-year-old Jellica Burke after a five-day trial at the High Court in EdinburghA man found guilty of murdering a woman and her two-year-old daughter before burying them under his kitchen floor has been told he must serve at least 36 years behind bars.  Andrew Innes, 52, was found guilty by a jury of murdering Bennylyn Burke, 25, and Jellica Burke after a five-day trial at the High Court in Edinburgh. It was also found he sexually abused the toddler and raped another child at his address between February 20 and March 5 2021.  Innes told the trial he was ""apocalyptically angry"" when he struck Ms Burke with a hammer and stabbed her on February 23 and around two to three days later killed the toddler.  He had denied all charges against him and lodged a special defence of diminished responsibility, but the jury dismissed it and Judge Lord Beckett sentenced him to life, with a minimum of 36 years. .  Innes repeatedly hit the woman on the back of the head with a hammer, then stabbed her with a samurai sword.  The toddler died of asphyxiation. The judge had instructed the jury to return guilty verdicts on both murder charges, following the medical evidence heard on Innes' state of mind at the time. During the trial, the jury witnessed some of the most harrowing evidence to come before a Scottish court. Innes admitted killing Ms Burke and Jellica but denied murdering them and on his arrest, when he asked where Ms Burke was, Innes told Pc Gavin Burns: ""She's under the kitchen floor.""  Of the two-year-old's whereabouts, he told Dc Hardie: ""Under the floor with mum. I couldn't look after a child. The child was screaming."" Innes had claimed Ms Burke lunged at him with a sushi knife and that killing her was an act of self-defence. But this was not true, he admitted as he took to the witness box on the third day of his trial. Instead, the court was told, he was ""apocalyptically angry"" as he hit her in the head repeatedly with a hammer before stabbing her with a samurai sword retrieved from his office. The killing came as she was preparing food in the kitchen when, he said, he thought she looked like a hybrid of his estranged wife and jilted lover. In a pre-recorded interview with one of his victims, the girl he was found to have raped, she told how a hammer was used to kill Ms Burke. The girl said Jellica was killed during a game of hide-and-seek, and told the interviewer she could not save them because ""she didn't know what was happening"". She said Innes sexually abused the toddler, and described the repeated sexual assaults and rapes inflicted on her.  Innes denied the sex attacks when arrested and on March 5 told Detective Constable Paul Hardie: ""I never touched the girl."" But a jury found this to be a lie, having been presented with DNA evidence from items including handcuffs and clothing.  Dr Gordon Cowan, a psychiatrist, told the court Innes had changed his story multiple times when asked why he killed Ms Burke.  At first it was acting in self-defence, then he heard voices, before Innes finally settled on his hybrid-vision story.  Dr Cowan said of Innes: ""It's clear he held resentment towards his ex-partners and this lady in front of him, in some way, reminded him of these ladies and he became angry, uncontrollably angry at her."" And, Dr Cowan told jurors, there was a point where Innes felt he was psychotic when he killed Ms Burke and not when he killed Jellica, but he later said he had been psychotic during both killings. He said he changed his description of events to suggest he was ""wondering around like a zombie"". Asked by Brian McConnachie KC, defending Innes, if his client's behaviour could have been linked to steroid-induced psychosis, Dr Cowan pointed out that, prior to the killing, Innes had gone to B&Q, where he bought a hammer.  He told the court if someone had florid psychosis, suffering hallucinations and delusions to the point where they were killing people, they would not be doing their normal business without people noticing. Innes claimed he was ""insane as a result of the steroids"" prescribed for his Crohn's disease, but Dr Cowan said he did not believe the 52-year-old was impaired at the time he murdered Mr Burke, nor when he killed the toddler. After he murdered them, with the toddler having been killed around three days after Ms Burke, he hid them below his kitchen floor at his home in Dundee. But Innes told the court they were not buried in concrete, saying during his evidence: ""I dug them a respectable grave and gave them a Christian burial and then replaced the floor. That's all I did.""  He also told the court of his attempted self-castration, negotiations with a potential ""sexual playmate"" and he railed against his estranged wife for cutting and dyeing her hair in a way he did not like. Speaking afterwards, Detective Chief Inspector Graham Smith, of Police Scotland's Major Investigation Team, said: ""The murders of Bennylyn Burke and her two-year-old daughter Jellica have shocked and appalled us all. ""In almost 30 years of policing, the depravity shown by Andrew Innes was beyond anything I, or colleagues, had witnessed before. ""Not only did he callously take the lives of a young mother and an innocent child, he then set out to escape justice by burying their bodies beneath his kitchen floor. ""His actions showed no regard for human life, or for the suffering and anguish he brought to their loved ones.""",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-man-found-guilty-murdering-29147674
"Turkey Syria earthquake: 10,000 feared dead in devastating shake as death toll increases","Rescue teams across the region are working day and night desperately trying to get those trapped to safety. Some of those beneath the rubble were using social media to guide rescuersThe death toll in the devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria could reach as high as 10,000, experts have warned. The grim figure came from the United States Geological Survey who are closely monitoring the humanitarian crisis. The powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit southern Turkey and northern Syria early Monday, razing buildings to the ground and trapping thousands beneath the rubble. . Another massive shake with the magnitude of 7.5 hit Turkey’s south hours after the original quake. People were left trapped and injured in several areas in the countries as it hit while they were sleeping. Tremors were felt as far as Cyprus, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon and Egypt, prompting Italy to issue a tsunami alert for coastal populations. The combined death toll in Turkey and Syria has been confirmed at least 3,400.   Most of the damage is in southern Turkey and northern and central Syria and the death toll is expected to grow as casualty reports come in from individual provinces. Multiple aftershocks have continued to be reported throughout the morning both in Syria and Turkey but also in Iraq and Lebanon, with hundreds of buildings damaged forcing residents to pour outside on a cold winter night.  “My grandson is 1 1/2 years old. Please help them, please. We can’t hear them or get any news from them since morning. Please, they were on the 12th floor,” Imran Bahur wept by her destroyed apartment building in the Turkish city of Adana.  Her daughter and family were still not found. Tens of thousands who were left homeless in Turkey and Syria faced a night in the cold. In Turkey’s Gaziantep, a provincial capital about 20 miles from the epicentre, people took refuge in shopping malls, stadiums and community centers.  Mosques around the region were opened to provide shelter. The quake, which was centred on Turkey’s southeastern province of Kahramanmaras, sent residents of Damascus and Beirut rushing into the street and was felt as far away as Cairo. Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said such a disaster could hit “once in a hundred years.” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said officials do not know how high the number of dead and injured will rise.  Syria has been devastated by more than 11 years of civil war, plus an economic and Covid-19 crisis. Many of the victims were living in squalid conditions and with little access to healthcare. The epicentre of the first earthquake was near the city of Gaziantep, about 60 miles from the Syrian border. Along with several cities, the area is home to home to millions of Syrian refugees who fled their country's long-running civil war. Turkey, which borders Syria to the north, hosts the largest number of Syrian refugees in the world. Thousands of people have fled Syrian dictator Assad's brutal bombardment and are now suffering through an enormous earthquake in the middle of winter.

Expert diver searching for Nicola Bulley says case is 'most baffling' in 25 years,"Nicola Bulley went missing in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, on January 27 and so far, no trace of her has been found after a specialist team began searching a river where police fear she fellThe head of a specialist team drafted in to search for Nicola Bulley in a river has said that they found no trace of her so far and described the case as the most ""baffling"" he has ever worked on. The 45-year-old mum disappeared on January 27 in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, after dropping her two daughters off at school. Private underwater search experts, using specialist sonar equipment to look for Ms Bulley in the river, did not find anything on Monday. Peter Faulding, the head of the private diving team Specialist Group International (SGI), said his team of experts and divers, based in Dorking, Surrey, worked with Lancashire Police and searched ""three or four miles"" of the river until it got dark. ""It's a negative search, no signs of Nicola,"" he said.   He said his team will look through another stretch of river on Tuesday ""towards where Nicola went originally missing"". Speaking on TalkTV, Mr Faulding said he is ""baffled"" as Nicola has not been found after 10 days. He said: ""After 25 years of doing this kind of work, after hundreds of cases, I am well and truly baffled. Normally you would expect the divers to find them easily.  ""When people drown they generally go down where they are. We normally find them within five to ten days of where they went down.  ""This is the most baffling case that I have ever worked on."" It comes after Nicola's partner Paul Ansell launched an appeal through Lancashire Police, saying her daughters miss her and need her back. Mr Ansell said: ""It's been 10 days now since Nicola went missing and I have two little girls who miss their mummy desperately and who need her back.""  He added: ""This has been such a tough time for the girls especially but also for me and all of Nicola's family and friends, as well as the wider community and I want to thank them for their love and support.

Detective Superintendent Rebecca Smith, of Lancashire Police, said: ""The team working on this investigation are completely dedicated and determined to find Nicola. ""As a mother myself, I can't even begin to imagine what her two children are going through.  ""Please be reassured that our sole focus is Nicola and that we are doing everything we can to find her. ""It is not possible to provide every piece of information to the public because to do so would detract from the investigation, but I'd like to thank everyone who has assisted us so far and for the support provided to Nicola's family at this extremely difficult time.

"Nicola Bulley's dog could hold vital key to whereabouts of missing mum, expert says","Nicola Bulley's dog could help detectives solve the search for her thanks to a strong sense of smell, according to expert Colin Tennant. The woman went missing on January 27Nicola Bulley's dog could hold the key to the missing woman's whereabouts, according to an expert. The 45-year-old mum went missing on January 27 after dropping off her two daughters at school in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire. A search operation was launched straight away, but so far there have been no sightings or confirmations from the police. One theory is that she might have slipped into the river, but detectives say they are keeping an open mind. At 9.35am on the day of her disappearance, a dog walker found Nicola's phone on a bench on a steep riverbank overlooking the water, along with the dog lead, with the dog harness on the ground.  Colin Tennant, director of the Cambridge Institute of Dog Behaviour and Training, said the missing mum's pet could hold the key to solving the case as dogs often return to the last spot where they were with their owner.    This is also due to the fact that dogs have a strong sense of smell and can understand if their owners were in a certain location. The expert said that if a person falls in a river, the dog tends to circulate in the area as the owner's scent would be on the ground and vegetation. However, dogs do no visualise markers as humans do - and Mr Tennant explained that a dog's sense of smell is 10,000 times more powerful and its vision is inferior than humans.   Writing in The Times, Mr Tennant explained: ""It can pick up locational scent: each area of land has its own peculiar scent and it maps the land with that olfactory system.  ""So it will smell the bank and keep going back to that scent. It will often migrate back to the last spot where it was with the owner because they’re its pack leader.""  However, Mr Tennant said that dogs cannot process what is happening if a human falls into a river. He wrote: ""If an owner is walking along the river and fell in, and went under, or the river carried them off, the dog would be absolutely perplexed because it doesn’t understand water like we do. It has no capacity for that. If the owner was screaming or shouting that could increase the dog's confusion.""   Tonight, Nicola's partner Paul Ansell issued a statement through Lancashire Police, calling for answers in the search for the woman and saying that her daughters are desperately missing her. He said: ""It's been ten days now since Nicola went missing and I have two little girls who miss their mummy desperately and who need her back. ""This has been such a tough time for the girls especially but also for me and all of Nicola’s family and friends, as well as the wider community and I want to thank them for their love and support.

Model who lost top lip in horror dog attack shows transformation after six operations,"Brooklinn Khoury, 23, was making a name for herself as a model online and was booked to appear in a TV advert the day after the horrific attack took place in November 2020A model who lost her top lip in a savage dog attack has shared her transformation after having six cosmetic surgeries to reconstruct her smile. Brooklinn Khoury, 23, was making a name for herself as a model online and was booked to appear in a TV advert the day after the horrific attack took place in November 2020. The social media star had been out with her cousin and her pitbull Diesel before returning home. But once there her pet lunged at her and sunk his teeth into her face and was ""hanging off her mouth"", she claims. Harrowing images from after the attack show her with no top lip and she claims she still finds them difficult to look at. In an interview with Inside Edition, she recalled: ""You could see the fear in my eyes, ‘Oh my God, that’s what I look like'. How do you fix this?    ""How do you fix this?’ I didn’t realise he had taken off my whole lip."" It has been two years since the incident. It took over a year to find a doctor who was willing to help her. But now Brooklinn has undergone six surgeries, some of which lasted 20 hours, to give her a new top lip.  Dr. Nicholas Do took skin and nerves from her arm, building a new fully functional upper lip but said: ""In plastic surgery, we can’t exactly recreate what was missing but if we can mimic it enough, it should almost be indistinguishable to the general public.""   She looks unrecognisable - even to herself as she said: ""Just having to look at myself in the mirror and having to tell myself and believe that what I am seeing is not the final product and loving myself regardless of how I look just from the inside out. ""I think if you were to tell me a year ago today that I would look the way that I do, I wouldn’t believe you."" However, her journey isn't over yet as she still has another surgery to undergo this month. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/model-who-lost-top-lip-29149714
World's shark attack hotspot is revealed - with 16 people bitten last year alone,"Florida has been revealed as the area which saw the most shark attacks during 2022 with a total of 16, but overall incidents have equalled a 10-year-low, according to a new studyBathers have been told that the most dangerous place for shark attacks in the world is Florida, according to a new study. Overall shark attacks were down during 2022 and equalled a 10-year low, but there were still 16 attacks off the Sunshine State's coast, None of those 16 incidents involved a fatality but two - likely from bull sharks - required medical treatment resulting in amputations. New data from the University of Florida’s International Shark Attack file shows there were a total of 57 unprovoked bites in 2022, most of which occurred in the United States and Australia.  Of those, five attacks were fatal, down from nine deaths in 2021 and 10 the year before.   Since 2013, there has been an average of 74 unprovoked attacks per year with 2020 a notable exception when Covid-related travel restrictions and beach closures likely resulted in fewer encounters between humans and sharks. Experts say the overall reduction in the number of reported attacks last year may reflect the documented global decline in shark numbers. Dr Gavin Naylor, director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s Florida Programme for Shark Research, said: “Generally speaking, the number of sharks in the world’s oceans has decreased, which may have contributed to recent lulls. “It’s likely that fatalities are down because some areas have recently implemented rigorous beach safety protocols, especially in Australia.” The International Shark Attack File places an emphasis on unprovoked bites in its annual report and does not highlight attacks that may have been prompted by mitigating circumstances, such as fishing lines cast in the direct vicinity of the incident or the presence of chum, fish guts, in the water. There were 32 additional bites in 2022 that fit the ISAF’s criteria for having been intentionally or unintentionally provoked. Dr Naylor said: “Unprovoked bites give us significantly more insight into the biology and behaviour of sharks. “Changing the environment such that sharks are drawn to the area in search of their natural food source might prompt them to bite humans when they otherwise wouldn’t.”  Among the Florida incidents, a woman snorkeling off the Dry Tortugas early in the year was notably bitten by a lemon shark, which rarely attack humans. The incident marked only the 11th known unprovoked attack by the species. The United States recorded the most attacks last year, but only had a single unprovoked fatality, which occurred when a snorkeler went missing along Keawakapu Beach in Maui, Hawaii. Australia had nine confirmed unprovoked bites, and single bites occurred in New Zealand, Thailand and Brazil. Two women tourists were fatally attacked on the same day in Egypt’s Red Sea, where shark encounters are considered rare. It remains unclear which species was responsible for the bites, but experts say that the shape and colouration of the fins indicate it may have been a tiger shark. South Africa, which averages a few bites a year, had two unprovoked attacks in 2022, both of which were fatal and likely caused by white sharks. Although there were fewer bites last year, a spike in localised incidents has prompted concern from residents and government officials in some areas. New York had a record eight bites in 2022, six of which have been confirmed. Before the attacks, the state had only 12 reported unprovoked bites.   In 2016, researchers determined that juvenile sand tiger sharks had taken up residence in Great South Bay, between Long Island and Fire Island.  The sharks continue to use the sheltered bay as a nursery, where they’re better protected from predators than they’d otherwise be in the open ocean. Dr Naylor says the majority of bites in Long Island were likely from sand tiger sharks that were drawn into the surf zone by an influx of baitfish. He said: “The Gulf Stream’s eddies ebb and flow each year. Sometimes they can come very close to shore, bringing nutrients and fish with them. The juvenile sand tigers will follow the fish, which in some cases leads to an uptick in encounters with people. “But local perceptions of shark bites rarely map to global statistics. If you zoom out, these eddies unpredictably break off from oceanic currents all over the world in haphazard ways.” For as long as records have been kept, there have been no reported fatalities from sand tiger attacks, but juveniles have often been implicated in non-lethal bites. Dr Naylor added: “Juveniles tend to be more experimental and will try things that an adult shark wouldn’t. If fish are especially dense where people are swimming and visibility is poor, then it is more likely that young sharks, which lack the experience of older animals, will mistake a swimmer’s foot for their intended prey.” But he said the chances of being bitten by a shark remain ""incredibly low"" and, as according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) drowning is the third leading cause of accidental death worldwide, coastal features such as rip tides and strong currents pose a greater risk to beachgoers than sharks.

Epsom College deaths: 'Shots heard' before headteacher and family found dead,"The bodies of Emma Pattison, 45, her daughter Lettie, seven, and her husband George, 39, were all found early Sunday morning on the grounds of Epsom CollegeGunshots were heard before the body of a headteacher was found alongside her husband and seven-year-old daughter, it has been reported. The bodies of Emma Pattison, 45, her daughter Lettie, seven, and her husband George, 39, were all found early Sunday morning on the grounds of Epsom College.  Police are carrying out an investigation into the circumstances of the deaths but stressed they believe this is an isolated incident with no third-party involvement. The family's next of kin are being supported by specialist officers. Officers said the tragedy will have sent shockwaves through the local community, and even though no third party was involved, they confirmed police would remain in the local area in the coming days.   A source told The Daily Telegraph that a member of staff called emergency services after hearing gunshots.  It is understood the family home is surrounded by other houses occupied by teachers and staff. It was also reported that the property is next to the school’s indoor rifle range, but that it has no live ammunition in it. The three deaths have been reported to the Coroner. Detective Chief Inspector Kimball Edey said: “On behalf of Surrey Police, my team, and I, I first want to express my sincerest condolences to the friends and family of Emma, Lettie and George, as well as to the students and staff of Epsom College, for their tragic loss.  ""I want to give my assurance that we will conduct a thorough investigation into what took place last night, and hope to be able to bring some peace in these traumatic circumstances. ""I would ask that their privacy is respected at this very difficult time.” Inspector Jon Vale, Epsom and Ewell’s Borough Commander, said: “We’re aware that this tragic incident will have caused concern and upset in the local community. ""While this is believed to be an isolated incident, in the coming days, our local officers will remain in the area to offer reassurance to students, parents, teachers, and the local community. ""I would like to thank the school and the community for their understanding and patience while the investigation continues.” The Chair of the Board of Governors at Epsom College expressed ""disbelief"" and ""utter shock"" at the tragic news.  Dr Alastair Wells, Chair of the Board of Governors at Epsom College, said: “On behalf of everyone at Epsom College, I want to convey our utter shock and disbelief at this tragic news. ""Our immediate thoughts and condolences are with Emma’s family, friends and loved ones, and to the many pupils and colleagues whose lives she enriched throughout her distinguished career. ""Emma was a wonderful teacher, but most of all she was a delightful person. ""In time we will commemorate Emma and her family, in the appropriate way, and in line with the wishes of her family. ""But for now, we ask that we are all given the time, space and respect we need to come to terms with this tragic loss.  ""There is currently a significant police presence at the location, and the surrounding area, and we would like to thank the local community for their understanding while our officers continue their investigation."" In a statement, the school, which was named independent school of the year in 2022, said: ""It is with the deepest sadness and regret that we have to announce the news of the deaths of Emma Pattison, Head of Epsom College, her daughter Lettie, and her husband George. ""Our thoughts, condolences and sympathies are with their families at this tragic time."" The school added: ""The College is working with the police in what remains an ongoing investigation. We must now focus on the welfare and wellbeing of our pupils and staff, and work to ensure that they receive all the comfort, warmth and support required from the Epsom College community."" The college concluded the statement by saying: ""We ask that the public and the media respect the privacy of Emma's family, and help us to prioritise the needs of our pupils. ""The news is heartbreaking and we need time and space to come together and process these shocking events. No further statement will be issued at this time."" Mrs Pattison became Epsom's first female head in September 2022 after six years as headteacher of Croydon High School in south London. Boarding students at the college pay more than £42,000 a year and its alumni include Conservative MP Sir Michael Fallon, broadcaster Jeremy Vine and comedian Tim Vine. Over 850 boys and girls attend the school, which was founded in 1853, and its acting head has been listed as Paul Williams. Mrs Pattison's husband George was a chartered accountant who was the director of a management consultancy firm called Tanglewood 2016, according to Companies House. In December, she told pupils she had bought a Labrador named Bella to live with them within the school grounds. Emma told the school's podcast: “In terms of transition it’s been a really big change for my family. We’ve moved house - we’ve bought a dog. “I’ve got a new job, my husband has got a new job, that wasn’t meant to happen but it did and my daughter has started a new school so there’s been a lot of change for us as a family.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-epsom-college-deaths-shots-29145970
'Human mole' in Nicola Bulley hunt probed 'Spy in the bag' case and April Jones murder,"Peter Faulding and his team of divers have been brought in to help find Nicola Bulley, who has been missing since January 27. The specialist worked on major cases including the murder of April Jones The forensic search specialist leading the hunt for missing mum Nicola Bulley is an expert who previously probed the ""Spy in the bag"" case and the murder of April Jones. Peter Faulding and his team of divers have been brought in to help find the woman, who has been missing since Friday, January 27. She dropped her two children at school in St Michael's on Wyre in Lancashire before going for a walk with her dog and vanishing near the River Wyre. Despite not having found any evidence of this, police think the missing mum slipped or fell into the river. Mr Faulding, from the specialist search group, said that if Ms Bulley is in the river, he will find her ""in minutes"".   Yesterday, he said: ""I have just had a long call with the Lancashire Police search adviser to discuss the search for Nicola. We will work closely with the police search teams who are working long hours to find Nicola. ""The team are leaving shortly from our base in Dorking on route to Lancashire to start tomorrow morning. #NicolaBulley"". The expert, who calls himself a ""human mole"", has successfully located human remains and helped solve several cold cases. During his career, he has also trained military members and police search advisers in the UK.  Mr Faulding also acted as a guest instructor with the US Secret Service, FBI and American military.  His career took off in 1996 when he worked to safely remove environmental protesters from man-made tunnels under the proposed route of the Newbury Bypass.  One of the biggest searches he worked on was the hunt for five-year-old April Jones, who was abducted and killed in 2012.   A vast search began after April's abduction and then-Prime Minister David Cameron even launched a personal appeal. Hundreds of volunteers participated in the search along with various police and rescue teams, but April's body was never located. Mark Bridger, a 46-year-old local man, was arrested and eventually convicted of her murder.  Described as a ""pathological liar"" and ""paedophile"" by the judge, he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a whole life order which means he will never be released. Although her body was never found, 17 fragments of bone were recovered from the fireplace in Bridge's cottage.  Mr Faulding also assisted with the cases of Scottish serial killer Peter Tobin and the mysterious death of ""Spy in the bag"". The naked body of MI6 spy Gareth Williams, 31, was found in a North Face holdall with the zips padlocked on the outside and the key inside with his corpse at his flat in Pimlico, London, a week after he was last seen alive.  In 2013, the Metropolitan Police concluded the GCHQ codebreaker's death was ""probably an accident"" and closed the case, but his family suspect he was murdered and a corner said he was probably unlawfully killed. The spy's £500 iPhone had all of its data wiped on August 15, 2010, the day he was last seen alive on CCTV and hours before he is believed to have died.

Mum dies after being trampled by herd of cows on holiday as she walks her dog in fields,"Kathy McKellar, 74, had been walking her dog in Grindleton, Lancashire, during a holiday when she was found trampled to death by cows, as her family urged people to be carefulA “fiercely independent” mother who loved the outdoors was found trampled to death by a herd of cows as she walked her dog. Kathy McKellar, 74, had been staying in a holiday cottage in Grindleton, Lancashire, in September last year when she went for a stroll with cockapoo Archie. Later that day the owner of the cottage, John Turner, found the dog with his lead still attached after he made his way back. When he was unable to find Kathy, Mr Turner called 999 before going to look for her, Lancslive reported. The following day farmer David Towler found Kathy’s body in a field and she was later pronounced dead at the scene by emergency services.   Speaking at an inquest held today, Kathy's son Andy described his mum as a ""fiercely independent"" woman who loved tennis, walking and baking. He said: “She would go on this sort of holiday regularly, she did everything for herself, and she brought up my brother and I pretty much on her own. ""She loved being outside and walking the dog; it was their happy place. Mum grew up in Clitheroe, that's where her family is from, but she moved to Macclesfield when she had me. ""We lost my nan two years ago from old age so mum liked to come back up here to feel more connected to her part of the world. “Although she was 74 she was still working part-time."" A post mortem CT scan revealed Kathy died from traumatic chest injuries including fractured vertebrae and ribs. Mr Towler told proceedings he was checking his animals on the farm when he noticed a bag on the grass which led him to Kathy’s body.  He said has not had any issues with any of his cows or bulls being aggressive and would sell any showing unusual behaviours or temperament. He said: “They can be quite protective when they have calves but only in the first few weeks; these calves were around five months old.  “We have two sheepdogs and we have sheep grazing with the cows so they're used to my dogs being around.”  The inquest heard there had been a previous incident involving a female walker suffering an injury when she disturbed some sleeping cows in one of Mr Towler's fields in 2018. In response the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) advised Mr Towler to move the water and feed troughs and put up a warning sign. HSE inspector Shellie Bee visited Scriddles Croft Farm a few weeks after Kathy's death and noted the warning sign had fallen down. However, she concluded as Kathy had entered the field via a different gate, she would not have seen the sign even if it had been up. The investigation concluded Mr Towler had followed all guidance issued to farmers regarding keeping members of the public safe from cattle.   However, because the specific circumstances leading to Kathy's death were not known, Mr Towler was issued with a notice requiring him to fence off the public footpath in this particular field. The inquest heard that, on average, there is one death a year in the UK relating to a member of the public being trampled by cattle. During 2021 there were five fatalities but this was during Covid lockdown when more people were going out for a walk. Kathy's son Andy voiced concerns that farmers are only issued guidance by the HSE instead of strict regulations. He added: ""People have died because they are just guidelines and that doesn't feel good enough. Guidelines are guidelines; you don't have to follow them and I just don't want to see this happen to anyone else."" Assistant Coroner Kate Bisset returned a narrative conclusion. Outside court Kathy's son Andy said he hoped that by raising awareness walkers would be more cautious around livestock and that farmers would ensure the public are protected as best as they can be.

Parents of UK's biggest family 'in agony' after teenage son ends up in trouble at school,"Sue and Noel Radford, whose family lives in a former care home in Morecambe, Lancashire, said they are worried about their son Josh, 14, as they received calls from his school after he was cautioned The parents of Britain's biggest family have shared their agony as they were contacted by one of their children's school after he landed himself in trouble.  Sue and Noel Radford said they are concerned about their son Josh's behaviour after he was cautioned multiple times in class, reports Lancs Live. In the latest episode of Channel 5 series 22 Kids and Counting, which follows the Radford family, dad Noel was seen receiving a telephone call at work.  The call came from his son Josh's school, as he explained: ""When I'm at work and I see a no caller ID, I just think 'oh what has Josh done now?' ""And it's generally 'we're having to put Josh in impact today'. They go to a room where there's other kids there who have been sent to impact. And you're just sat on your own, learning on your own.""   Mum Sue added: ""The thing that worries me the most about him going in impact all the time is that, you know, he's rubbing shoulders with the wrong crowd. I don't really know what to do about Josh. ""I've never been as worried about any of our kids than what I am about Josh."" Noel, whose family lives in a former care home in Morecambe, Lancashire, said: ""I'm worried that he'll get mixed in with the wrong group of kids, out of school and they're going off doing things they shouldn't be doing.  ""I worry about him getting into drugs and knife crime and stuff like that."" Sue added: ""It's a slippery slope, isn't it?"" The two parents said they wanted to act quickly ""before it's too late"" and help their child get back on track. Mum Sue said: ""When kids are low in confidence, the key is to get them out there, get them to explore new things.""  They took Josh and the rest of the family on an adventure trip to the Ardeche Gorge in France, during which they had a conversation with him. Noel explained that they told Josh: ""You've got to knuckle down and get your education, rather than dossing about. ""There's two paths in life, you can go the right way or the wrong way. The wrong way seems more of a laugh, but you've got your whole life ahead of you and it's not always going to be like that. ""Make the right choices while you're young and everything will be better when you're older.""   Following the conversation, Josh said: ""I've started to realise how much we rely on our dad. I think it'll be a good thing if I grow up to be like my dad.""

UK regions face 'blackout chaos' as power grid workers threaten to strike over pay,"Large areas of East and South East England could face ""blackout chaos"" as workers at UK Power Networks consider striking, the Unite union has warned as a decision is expected tomorrowBrits have been warned of fears over ""blackout chaos"" as power workers threaten to strike.  Roughly 1,300 staff at UK Power Networks are being balloted amid what Unite says is ""rampant profiteering"", and a decision is expected tomorrow. The Unite union said possible blackouts could lead to ""chaos"" in London, the South East and East England during potential industrial action in March.  A spokesperson told the Mirror: ""The workers maintain and repair the power network so if there’s an outage when the strikes are on there will be a delay in fixing it."" Workers are said to be angry that UK Power Networks, owned by Hong Kong conglomerate CK Group, did not offer a pay rise in line with the retail prices index measure of inflation.  The company has made profits of £2.4billion since 2019.    Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “UK Power Networks’ rampant profiteering when people’s homes are freezing due to astronomical energy bills is a perfect illustration of why the UK’s economy is broken. ""And just because our members work on the power grid doesn’t mean they are exempt from the sky-high electricity bills that have helped plunge the country into crisis. “Putting forward a pay offer our members could accept would barely make a dent in UK Power Networks’ obscene profits. The company can afford to pay and must do so.”  If the ballot results in a vote for industrial action, then residents in the affected areas can expect strikes between February 7 and March 7.  UK Power Networks told the Mirror:"" We hope to avoid strike action, however we are making plans to ensure our network remains resilient in the event Unite press ahead with strike action."" The company previously said it had offered 18 per cent over the last two years and that they have ""long supported our employees."" Unite disputes the claim of 18 per cent and said a seven per cent rise was ""imposed"" on workers for the first year.  They said:"" This includes an already imposed seven per cent for the first year and an average of February 2023’s RPI and CPI(h) inflation rates for the second. The deal is not worth 18 per cent as the company claim.""  Around 98 per cent of members voted in a consultative ballot to reject the deal offered by UK Power Networks.

Gunman opens fire in San Francisco synagogue days after posting Nazi imagery,"Dmitri Mishin, 51, casually walked into Schneerson Centre in San Francisco, US, and reportedly told one of the men ""I'm going to show you something"" before opening fireA gunman has opened fire in a synagogue just days after posting Nazi imagery online as members were left ""paralysed by fear"". Dmitri Mishin, 51, has been arrested after he fired shots in the Schneerson Centre, which is largely attended by Russian-speaking Jews, on Wednesday evening. In the shocking footage, Mr Mishin is seen casually walking into the synagogue before getting his gun out after reportedly telling one of the men: ""I'm going to show you something."" The man calmly walks around the synagogue as the group eat together when he pulls out his gun - and starts to threaten them.  Mr Mishin is seen struggling to operate the gun before eventually opening fire. Remarkably, none of the group show any kind of reaction to the threat as they remain seated as one person even takes a phone call outside as he nonchalantly walks off.   Police were called to the scene but the suspect fled before eventually being arrested two days later on Friday. Fortunately, no one was injured in the terrifying incident. Rabbi Alon Chanukov, the vice president of the synagogue, said the horrific incident was a ""hate crime"" as the suspect came to ""terrorise"" them.  He told ABC7: ""Terrorism doesn't have to have killings. In my mind, what he did was he came, and he did a terrorist attack. He came to terrorise people.  ""The action is terrifying. To have a stranger come in and start shooting in your place of worship, in you place where you should feel safe."" The suspect was known to authorities after he was caught on Tuesday evening, the day before the attack, bringing a gun into a cinema just yards away from the synagogue before quickly leaving.  Social media activity, believed to be from Mr Mishin's accounts, show the gunman posting disturbing images of far-right and neo-Nazi imagery.   Just three days before the shooting, he posted images of him appearing in WW2-era German military uniform. He posted an old photo of him appearing in a Nazi uniform, with a swastika and a hand grenade. In addition, he also reportedly uploaded a video of an object burning in front of the Schneerson Center synagogue.  The attack has left members of the community frightened including Matthew Finklestein, who said everyone was paralysed with fear, which is why they didn't leave their chairs.  He said: ""People didn’t even leave their chairs. This guy was wielding a gun. It’s because they were paralysed with fear.""  While another member, who wishes to remain anonymous, said Mr Mishin came into the synagogue and spoke Russian before allegedly making a comment about Israel's national intelligence. He said: ""I believe that may have been when he said, ‘Say hello to Mossad for me.'  ""And so somehow he was harming Mossad by scaring the Jews in America at this one synagogue. I am not really clear.  ""Obviously, I think the person is deranged, the person is mentally unwell."" The Rabbi believes the group didn't react as they believed the suspect was a friendly visitor. He told CBS News: ""'This person was seen as a friendly person, as a person who is probably just a Russian Jew who walked in off the street.  ""You don't take a gun, make sure to have bullets that are blanks, go to a Russian-speaking synagogue during a celebration weekly class on a Wednesday and shoot it up and say something about Mossad just by coincidence."" The suspect was booked into County Jail shortly on a number of charges including disturbing a religious assembly and brandishing an imitation firearm.

"Meghan Markle 'won't be happy' about Harry's first lover speaking out, expert claims","One royal commentator has claimed that Meghan Markle will be left disgruntled after Harry's first lover - an 'older woman' - has spoken out revealing her side of their five-minute romp of passionMeghan Markle is “not going to be happy” after Prince Harry’s first lover spoke out, one royal commentator has claimed. Sasha Walpole has revealed details about her alleged outdoor romp with the Prince. In his recent biography ‘Spare’ the Duke of Sussex described in detail losing his virginity in a field behind a busy pub. He said it was to an “older woman”, despite the fact Ms Walpole is only two years older than him - and also younger than his wife Meghan. He detailed the salacious passage in his memoir, but now Ms Walpole has emerged to tell her side of the story. But in the aftermath, royal commentator Robert Jobson has claimed the Duchess of Sussex will be annoyed by the revelations.   Mr Jobson tweeted: ""Loving the interviews with Harry’s 'older woman'. ""She seems down to Earth telling 'her truth' for cash. ""Not sure Meg will like Sasha Walpole telling Piers Morgan that the Harry she knew seems under a spell. ""But 'H' started it by writing about her."" Ms Walpole described her five-minute romp of passion with the prince while his security searched for him in a blue Ford Fiesta.  The former Highgrove Groom said the June 2001 encounter was a “wham-bam” between friends, where she ended up losing her belt. The mum-of-two said the booze-fuelled sex happened outside a Wiltshire pub, where Prince William had also been that night. Detailing the night, Ms Walpole said that Harry made the first move for their “moment of passion”. There were some discrepancies between the two accounts however, with the Duke claiming he was 17 at the time, but Ms Walpole’s story saying it was during the summer of 2001 - when he was 16.  “I am the woman who took Harry’s virginity,"" she told The Sun on Sunday. ""It was ­literally wham-bam between two friends. ""The sex was passionate and sparky because we shouldn’t have been doing it. One thing just quickly led to another. We ended up on the floor.” Ms Walpole claims the pair had downed several shots of tequila at the time, with Prince Harry's security team out looking for him while they canoodled. She said that the two of them had been drinking at the Vine Tree Inn in Norton, Wiltshire, celebrating her 19th birthday when they snuck off into a field behind the historic pub's car park for a cigarette. “It was exciting that it was happening. It was exciting that it was happening like the way it was. We were away for 15 minutes but the sex was about five ­minutes.” Ms Walpole added: “We didn’t set out to do it and it wasn’t pre-meditated. He was young. ""We had been purely friends and it was a little bit naughty, in the sense that it shouldn’t have been happening.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/meghan-wont-happy-woman-claiming-29139769

One of his tutors at school said: “We’re just proud that we [were] able to individualise his instruction.”   David isn't just about studying though he also plays sports and the piano. He is training towards his black belt in martial arts. His mum Ronya said it was difficult raising a child with such capacity for learning. She said: ""I had to get outside of the box. Playing pillow fights when you're not supposed to, throwing the balls in the house.  ""He's a 9-year-old with the brain that has the capacity to understand and comprehend a lot of concepts beyond his years and sometimes beyond my understanding.""  David also credits his progress to his teachers. His science teacher Cody Derr said:""David was an inspirational kid, definitely one who changes the way you think about teaching."" Now David and his family are figuring out where to go from here and even eyeing up college for the young prodigy. His dad Henry said: ""Am I going to throw my 9-year-old into Harvard while I'm living in PA? No.""  Graduating at the age of nine puts David among the youngest people ever to graduate from high school. The person holding the Guinness World Record is Michael Kearney.

Mum and her seven kids killed in house fire 'sparked by faulty tumble dryer',"Police fear the dad told his wife and children to stay in the second-floor attic of their property when he went down to investigate the heavy smoke coming from downstairs in Charly-sur-Marne, France A mum and her seven children have died in a house fire thought to have been caused by a malfunctioning tumble dryer.  The horror unfolded on Monday morning in Charly-sur-Marne, 50 miles east of Paris, where the family lived in a town house. A manslaughter investigation has now been launched. ""It appears that their tumble dryer on the ground floor caught fire,"" said local prosecutor Julien Morino-Ros. ""The children, five girls and two boys aged between two and 14, and their mother died of asphyxiation,"" he said. Mr Morino-Ros confirmed that – in line with judicial procedure in such cases – a criminal enquiry had been opened for manslaughter. There was no initial information about the type of tumble dryer involved, or its manufacturer or service history.   It is thought that the family may have put the dryer on in the early hours of the morning, when electricity costs are cheaper. The only survivor from the family – who cannot initially be named for legal reasons – was the father, who was badly burned. Police fear he told his wife and children to stay in the second-floor attic of their property when he went down to investigate the heavy smoke coming from the dryer.  This turned into ""a trap"" for those who died, said the prosecutor, as all the electric shutters upstairs jammed following a power failure. Firefighters arrived soon after 1am, but they had trouble getting in to the upper floors of the house. Sylvie Corré, wife of the owner of the rented property, said: ""I hope with all my heart that those who died did not feel any pain, or see anything. ""We were there in the street all night and watched the horror.""  Ms Corré said her family employed the father in their champagne business and described him as ""an excellent employee"". She said the couple were in their 40s, and – along with their children – were very popular in the area. The father spent a night in hospital, and his condition later on Monday was described as ""stable and not life threatening"". Fire chief Jean-Claude Ouguel said: ""The house was completely destroyed. Only the side walls remain."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/mum-seven-kids-killed-house-29146615
Woman living in graveyard locked in row with council over rats 'digging under her house',"Philippa Berry, who claims the placing of five bins near her home by the graveyard has attracted rodents, is in a row with Edinburgh council and Friends of Dalry CemeteryA woman who lives on the grounds of a graveyard is locked in a row with her local council over an apparent rat infestation. Philippa Berry, who lives in Dalry Cemetery Lodge House, Edinburgh, says she was forced to use pest control after five bins were put outside her property. She is involved in a dispute with Friends of Dalry Cemetery and City of Edinburgh Council, who she claims were wrong to put the bins which have led to the infestation of rats and mice. Philippa, 58, says that she has now had to deal with rodents in her home and has reached an impasse with the cemetery representatives.   She told Edinburgh Live: ""They put five bins in, and as a result I got mice. I asked the council to put one bin there and I was told no, you can’t do that because of wheelchair access. “The Friends of Dalry Cemetery ask to put five bins in and that’s allowed? “They’ve breached my privacy as the bins were placed outside my kitchen window. I suffered issues with mice due to increased rat activity and damage to my front wall due to earth displacement by rats. “The council has added a whole load of bins without speaking to me first, and the problem is I’ve had rats that dig under my house. “I saw an albino rat in my garden, and it actually turned up to my pizza party. It turned up and started eating popcorn. Somebody was drunk and thought it was a pet so started stroking it.” A report from the pest control company, which Philippa contacted at the time, reportedly reads: “Possible reason for mice in property may be down to increased rat activity at bins outside kitchen window area, fresh rat evidence was found at the bins.”  Philippa is also rowing with Friends of Dalry Cemetery over security cameras and panic buttons that have been installed during to antisocial behaviour at the cemetery. But she claims that Friends of Dalry Cemetery have asked for the security system to be ""reduced"". They claimed the sensor and audible alarm was going off for almost every person who walked into the cemetery - and requested Philippa adjust the sensors.  This was after a shed, containing gardening tools and other items for the Friends group, was placed across from her kitchen window. Philippa added: ""I was told it would be moved. They wouldn't give me a date, and there was people hanging around across from my window. Months later it was finally moved."" Philippa is currently pursuing legal action against the council. The Mirror has contacted City of Edinburgh Council and Friends of Dalry Cemetery for comment. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/woman-living-graveyard-locked-row-29144217
Nicola Bulley's friends slam suggestion partner was involved as 'disgusting',"Nicola Bulley's friend posted on Facebook in a bid to dispel ""disgusting"" rumours that partner Paul was involved in her disappearance with the search in its 11th dayA friend of missing mum Nicola Bulley has slammed the suggestion that her partner was involved in her disappearance as ""disgusting"". Amateur sleuths have filled Facebook groups and forums since the 45-year-old vanished, coming up with their own wild theories - often completely misplaced and upsetting to the family. One such line of thinking among the keyboard warriors is that long-time boyfriend Paul Ansell was involved. Nicola had dropped the couple's children off at school in St Michaels on Wyre, Lancashire, on January 27 before going on a walk with springer spaniel Willow. Her phone was later found on a bench along a river towpath, with the dog wandering nearby without its lead or harness. A major police search has since been launched, with police working mainly along the hypothesis that the mum accidentally fell into the water. Have you been affected by this story? Let us know at webnews@mirror.co.uk   However, they admit there is no clear evidence of this - but investigators do not believe a third party was involved. Nicola's friend Tilly Ann posted on Facebook - with the family's permission - in an effort to dispel some of the rumours being spread. She said: ""Paul and Nikki both mostly work from home which is why he was at home that day. ""They have CCTV and there is a reason why Paul has never been a suspect.  ""Family and friends need these accusations to stop immediately. The fact that I've had to write this is disgusting to be honest."" Paul released another heartfelt plea over the weekend as the search for continues. He said the family needs a ""happy ending to this nightmare"". Paul added: ""The agony continues but the hope is stronger than ever of finding you.""  Surrey-based SGI's ‘top of the market’ 18,000khz side scan sonar was launched from the suspected entry point at around 11.30am after the team was briefed by police. Team founder Peter Faulding had flown a helicopter over the stretch of river down to the estuary to get a better understanding of the location. He told the Mirror the sonar would likely pick up a body within minutes if it is in the immediate stretch of river next to wear Nicola's phone was found.  “If Nicola is in there, we will find her. If she’s there, our sonar will pick her up straight away,"" he said. “I will see a body on the bottom. We are dealing with about 10 drownings every summer. We always locate within the hour. It’s that quick, it’s that good. “Nicola wouldn’t have gone far if she was in this river because it’s got shallows and she would get lodged. There’s no way she would have gone out to the estuary.

New York earthquake: Millions woken up by tremors in biggest quake in 40 years,"New York reported a 3.8 earthquake centered east of Buffalo in the suburb of West Seneca which sent residents to their windows and social media in search of an explanationNew York has suffered its strongest earthquake in at least 40 years after millions of people in the state were woken up by the shake.  The U.S. Geological Survey preliminarily reported a 3.8 earthquake centered east of Buffalo in the suburb of West Seneca at about 6:15 a.m this morning.  Seismologist Yaareb Altaweel said it was the region's strongest quake in at least 40 years. The shaking lasted a few seconds and sent residents first to their windows and then to social media in search of an explanation. ""It felt like a car hit my house in Buffalo. I jumped out of bed,"" Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz tweeted.  County emergency services officials confirmed the earthquake was felt in at least a 30-mile radius, including in Niagara Falls, about 20 miles north of Buffalo, he said. Governor Kathy Hochul said there were no immediate reports of damage to buildings.   She said: ""My team is in touch with local officials and we will provide any support needed."" Resident Jim LiPuma told Buffalo News the earthquake shook his whole house after he heard a painting fall of his garage wall. He said: “It was a heavy vibration that shook the whole house. It was crazy. “We got up to see if a car hit the house or something like that. That’s what it felt like.” West Seneca Police joked: “Well good morning everyone. Just your usual Buffalo morning earthquake, back to bed.” Small earthquakes are not unusual in upstate New York but are rarely felt as strongly.   The earthquake comes on the heels of two record-breaking weather events in the region. A snowstorm that dropped as much as 7 feet of snow in November and a blizzard in December that is blamed for 47 deaths. In addition, the earthquake has come just hours after a powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit southern Turkey and northern Syria on Monday morning.  At least 1,500 people have been killed and 6,474 people have been wounded with many left trapped in the rubble.   A huge aftershock with a magnitude of 7.5 struck Turkey just hours after the original earthquake. It was also felt in Syria and Iraqi Kurdistan as people were left trapped by the quake while they were sleeping.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan confirmed 1,014 have died, bringing the overall death toll in Turkey and Syria to 1,500. And with most of the damage hitting southern Turkey and northern and central Syria, the death toll is expected to grow. A United States Geological Survey spokesperson said there is no connection between the two events. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/breaking-new-york-earthquake-region-29092451

"Desperate mum says school bullies strangled and cut daughter, 6, with scissors","A parent from Midlothian has revealed the injuries her daughter has sustained at school, following a period of bullying and falling from a heightA mum says she has been left fearing for her daughter's safety after she said she was strangled and cut open by bullies at just five years old. The woman, who did not wish to be named, said she has been left appalled by the incidents her daughter has been involved in at a Midlothian school in Scotland. She has raised concerns over the way the school and Midlothian Council have investigated them.  Speaking anonymously to Edinburgh Live, she told of how her daughter would often come home with cuts and bruises, with the majority of the incidents occurring when the child was five. The parent has released images of the injuries.  She also told of the psychological effect the incidents have had on her daughter, saying that she is now scared of going to school and is in a state of worry. The parent also admitted that she doesn’t know where to turn to, to ensure her child is safe at school.   Of the incidents that occurred, the woman said her daughter was strangled on multiple occasions, punched, and had her hair pulled and cut off by bullies. The child also was injured after falling from a height and hitting her head. The woman said: ""I first noticed there was something wrong around Easter time, 2022. She came home with multiple cuts on her face. The teacher said they didn't know how it happened. She then told me someone grabbed her neck in the playground in April and had purple finger marks on her neck the next day. ""We also pursued legal advice following an incident where she was concussed after falling onto her head from a height. She was asked to put something away on a stool and fell as a result, but we were told by the council that following an internal investigation, my daughter was swinging on her chair and fell. ""I want to make my daughter safe, I'm not attacking individual teachers or children. I've come home and sat in tears after dropping her off as she refuses to go in and tells me she's scared.”  In response to her concerns, the parent says she feels she has been treated as though she isn’t believed by school staff. She then put forward a complaint to the council, which has been seen by Edinburgh Live, the response outlining that an accident form should have been filled out following the head injury. Following the outcome report, the council suggested the parent contact Education Scotland if she was still unhappy. A letter, seen by Edinburgh Live, states that two of the parent's complaints were partially upheld. One of them stated that the child should have been under constant supervision following her head injury. The second state that incidents should be investigated in a timely manner. A Midlothian Council spokesperson said: “We take all allegations of bullying very seriously. There are procedures in place within the school and within the Education and Children’s Services division to deal with reported incidents and to respond to concerns and complaints. “These procedures have been followed and the concerns of the family fully investigated. The school has met with the parent and will continue to work with her to address any issues.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/desperate-mum-says-school-bullies-29130605

Britain's roadside shame as pictures reveal 'tsunami' of litter thrown by lazy motorists,"Clean Up Britain founder John Read has described the country's roadsides as 'disgusting' and like the 'Wild West' when it comes to authorities' grip on litter loutsRevolting images have lifted the lid on the ""tsunami"" of rubbish lazy Brits are throwing from their vehicle windows. This banking by a roundabout near Watford is just one of thousands of roadsides across Britain which has been festooned with fast food boxes, coffee cups and other litter hurled from passing vehicles.  Pictures of disgusting scenes from across the country's road network were shared by Clean Up Britain founder John Read, who claimed motorway drivers were the ""worst offenders"" when it comes to slinging rubbish onto roadsides. In one particularly stomach-churning picture, a footpath by the side of the A3 has been almost blocked by a mound of plastic bottles which will take around 450 years to biodegrade. The anti-litter campaigner branded the spots ""disgusting"", adding that authorities policing our roads were also failing to keep them clean.   One particular roadside spot on the outskirts of Greater Manchester was monitored by John, with images showing a filthy river of litter running alongside the busy junction. The M58/M6 interchange near Wigan is thought to be one of the worst-blighted areas in the UK for littering, with thousands of motorists passing through each day. John, 60, said: ""We have an enforcement system that is fractured, agencies like National Highways are responsible for keeping our roads safe and clean but they are failing. ""I drive up and down the UK and there is litter everywhere, every single motorway is disgusting it is covered in litter.  ""The problem is that National Highways should not have to be litter picking, but due to the litter being there, it is their responsibility to clean it."" He added: ""When it comes to litter and fly-tipping it is anarchy, there is no law enforcement in this country.  ""The UK is the Wild West, the penalties are ridiculously low which reflects on how our politicians are spineless.""  Currently, average fines for people caught littering in public are £65-100, but John said these were still ""ridiculously low"" and it was time to get tougher on litter louts. A petition he created to increase littering fines has already been signed by more than 60,000 people. ""We need to see fines increase to £1000 for littering, we need to show some guts but that is lacking in the Government. I drive all over the country, it is a sh*t hole, we are heading towards a third-world country. ""There are more than 17 million people who admit to littering in Britain which is why the country is so filthy. ""Britain is continuing to degenerate into a tsunami of litter.""  Keep Britain Tidy estimates that around two million pieces of rubbish are dropped every day in the UK, costing taxpayers an annual bill of £1bn for street cleaning. Data released by the Government last month meanwhile revealed councils in England dealt with 1.13million fly-tipping incidents in 2020/21 - a 16% rise from the year before - with roadsides by far the most common place for criminals to dump rubbish. But the number of court fines for fly-tippers in the same year more than halved, clawing back just £440k of the £11.6m spent cleaning up the largest loads.

Salman Rushdie breaks silence after knife attack left author fighting for his life,"Sir Salman Rushdie, who wrote the controversial novel The Satanic Verses, was attacked at the Chautauqua Institution in New York state on August 12 last year by 24-year-old Hadi MatarSalman Rushdie has revealed he has suffered nightmares since a knife attack left him fighting for his life.  The 75-year-old was airlifted to hospital on August 12, 2022 after Hadi Matar, 24, from Fairview New Jersey, US, brutally attacked him at the Chautauqua Institution, where Sir Salman was due to speak. The author has broken his silence for the first time since an alleged assassination attempt carried out as he prepared to deliver a speech. Seven months on, Sir Salman has told how his life has been irreversibly changed, being left blind in one eye, his lower lip left drooping to one side, and severe never damage in his left hand. He has also lost more than three stones in weight. And since the attack Mr Rushdie has confessed he has suffered nightmares, which could be linked to the horrific incident.  He told New Yorker: ""There have been nightmares—not exactly the incident, but just frightening. Those seem to be diminishing.   ""I’m fine. I’m able to get up and walk around. When I say I’m fine, I mean, there’s bits of my body that need constant checkups. It was a colossal attack.” He also said the attack has left him struggling to type due to the injuries sustained in his fingertips. The author was asked if he could type, he revealed: “Not very well, because of the lack of feeling in the fingertips of these fingers.” Mr Rushdie joked that people like him better now that he has survived an assassination attempt.  He spoke about how many previously complained about his existence. “People didn’t like it. Because I should have died,” he said. “Now that I’ve almost died, everybody loves me. That was my mistake back then. Not only did I live, but I tried to live well. Bad mistake. Get 15 stab wounds, much better.” “It’s very nice that everybody was so moved by this, you know?” he continued. “I had never thought about how people would react if I was assassinated or almost assassinated.” Mr Rushdie said that despite his injuries he is slowly making progress. He added: ""Well, you know, I’ve been better. ""But, considering what happened, I’m not so bad. As you can see, the big injuries are healed, essentially. I have feeling in my thumb and index finger and in the bottom half of the palm. ""I’m doing a lot of hand therapy, and I’m told that I’m doing very well.""  “I’ve always tried very hard not to adopt the role of a victim. “Then you’re just sitting there saying, ‘Somebody stuck a knife in me. Poor me,’ Which I do sometimes think."" The writer said he has struggled since the attack to write again. “There is such a thing as P.T.S.D., you know,” he said. “I’ve found it very, very difficult to write. I sit down to write, and nothing happens. I write, but it’s a combination of blankness and junk, stuff that I write and that I delete the next day. I’m not out of that forest yet, really.” He said he spent the past seven months at his New York home healing while watching his fair share of “crap television”, admitting he did not take to the Netflix documentary on Meghan and Harry.  “The banality of it,” he said. When asked about his alleged attacker, Hadi Matar, the novelist described him as an “idiot.” “I don’t know what I think of him because I don’t know him. All I’ve seen is his idiotic interview in the New York Post. Which only an idiot would do,"" Sir Salman commented. Matar, 24, was arrested and charged with one count of second-degree attempted murder and one count of second-degree assault in relation to the attack. He pleaded not guilty, and his trial will likely occur in 2024.  Matar, from Fairview, New Jersey, has reportedly refused to say if the fatwa issued by the late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini against Sir Salman led to the attack. On the day of the attack, the author was sat down alongside moderator Henry Reese, 73, who was a newbie when it came to readings. Mr Rushdie tried to reassure him as he took a deep breath and looked at the crowd. However, when he turned to Mr Rushdie he suddenly saw Matar had attacked him, which he first thought was a prank.  Mr Reese told the New Yorker: “I thought it was a prank, some really bad-taste imitation attack, something like the Will Smith slap.”   But despite the attack he feels he is fortunate to still be alive. He said: ""I’m lucky. What I really want to say is that my main overwhelming feeling is gratitude.” Mr Reese saw the blood on the author's cheek and soon realised it wasn't a joke. The moderator added: “It then became clear there was a knife there, but at first it seemed like just hitting. ""For a second, I froze. Then I went after the guy. Instinctively. I ran over and tackled him at the back and held him by his legs.” Matar stabbed Mr Rushdie dozens of times and he quickly turned to Mr Reese and stabbed him which left him with a huge gash above his eye. A doctor, who had breakfast with the author that morning, was sitting in the second row of the talk and immidetely sprung out of his seat and ran up the stars. The man, who has not been named, tried to snatch the knife of the attack and helped save Mr Rushdie's life as police were called and led the attacker off the stage. Mr Rushdie was bleeding from his stab wounds. From the right side of his neck and face, his left hand, and his stomach. He was still conscious but a firefighter, along with a four doctors, rushed to his side as two of the medics held up his legs to help with his blood supply. While a fireman placed his hand on the right side of Mr Rushdie's neck to try and stop the bleeding along with the bleed next to his eye. The fireman told Mr Rushdie: “Don’t blink your eye, we are trying to stop the bleeding. Keep it closed.” Rushdie was responsive. “Okay I agree,” he said. “I understand.” His left hand was bleeding heavily which forced one of the doctors to cut off the sleeve of his jacket and tie the wound with a clean handkerchief. However, within seconds it was full of blood as the doctor was left stunned. He ""squeezed the tissues as hard as I possibly could."" Mr Rushdie was in so much pain with his hand he asked"" “What’s going on with my left hand? It hurts so much!” Emergency services arrived and immediately put the author on an I.V drip and put him onto a stretcher as they wheeled him out the theatre. He was helicopter to Level 2 trauma center, Hamot, part of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, in Erie, Pennsylvania. The author was in hospital for six weeks and since his release he has stayed at home unless it is for trips to the doctors.

Russia Today's Twitter suspended as social media site says 'account withheld',"The account for the Kremlin-funded media site, Russia Today, has been suspended in a number of countries amid controversies over its coverageThe Twitter account of the Russian state-controlled international news television network Russia Today has been suspended. The account for the Kremlin-funded media site has been suspended in a number of countries amid controversies over its coverage. The Twitter profile now shows a blank white page, with no picture or logo as well as no verified blue tick. A small block of text explains that the account has been withheld in a number of countries, including the UK and a large number of other European ones.  It says: ""@RT_com's account has been withheld in Portugal, Finland, Sweden, Ireland, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Italy, Malta, Germany, Greece, Romania, Netherlands, Bulgaria, Austria, Luxembourg, Latvia, United Kingdom, Denmark, Lithuania, Croatia, Estonia, Cyprus, France, Spain, Belgium in response to a legal demand.""   Back in October, Russia Today’s controversial editor-in-chief reached out to Twitter CEO Elon Musk personally and requested that he release her network from Twitter purgatory. Margarita Simonyan said: “Elon, since you’re all for free speech, maybe unban RT and Sputnik accounts and take the shadow ban off mine as well.” RT is a horrific backer of the country’s invasion of Ukraine and Ms Simonyan once celebrated the deliberate targeting of civilians in Kyiv. A chilling segment on RT also saw a Kremlin propagandist arguing in favour of drowning Ukrainian children in rivers and burning them in their own homes.  RT's Director of Broadcasting Anton Krasovsky suggested that any child who believes their country is being occupied by Russia needs to be thrown into a fast river and drowned alive. His other suggestion was to put the children into wooden houses, nail the doors shut and burn them alive. ""They should have been drowned in the Tysyna River, right there where the ducklings swim,"" he says with a smirk on his face. ""Just drown those children. Drown them.""

Epsom College headteacher found dead with family revealed ‘big change’ in last podcast,"Epsom College head Emma Pattison, 45, her husband George, 39 and their daughter Lettie were found on the grounds of the school in the early hours of Sunday morningThe head of a private school had told pupils about a ""big change"" with her family two months before she, her husband and her seven-year-old daughter were found dead. Epsom College head Emma Pattison, 45, her husband George, 39 and their daughter Lettie were found on the grounds of the school in the early hours of Sunday morning. Surrey Police were called to Epsom College at 1am on Sunday and the South East Coast Ambulance Service attended where the bodies were found.  Police have confirmed that it was an isolated incident and there was no third-party involvement. In December, Mrs Pattison told pupils she had bought a Labrador named Bella to live with them within the school grounds. She told the school's podcast: “In terms of transition it’s been a really big change for my family. We’ve moved house - we’ve bought a dog.   “I’ve got a new job, my husband has got a new job, that wasn’t meant to happen but it did and my daughter has started a new school so there’s been a lot of change for us as a family.” In the podcast episode, which had since been deleted, she also spoke about her approach to life, saying she was a lifelong learner, the Mail Online reports. ""If you're a reader and a modern linguist who likes going and talking to people and exploring different versions of life I think that fits in with someone who always wants to grow, learn, explore and, I suppose, live life to the fullest,"" she said. In the podcast, Mrs Pattison told of how she got into teaching after flicking through a copy of the Times Educational Supplement at a coffee shop.  At the time she was on the graduate programme for Thomas Cook, a job she said she ""absolutely hated"". The head said she ""hadn't looked back"" since entering into teaching and told the student-presented podcast ""working with you people keeps you young, they keep you energised"". ""I am absolutely loving my time here so far,"" Mrs Pattison added. ""It's been very busy but absolutely wonderful. The college have been so supportive and everyone has been very, very welcoming."" The school, which was named independent school of the year in 2022, released a statement yesterday evening expressing their condolences and asking for privacy. In a statement, the school said: ""It is with the deepest sadness and regret that we have to announce the news of the deaths of Emma Pattison, Head of Epsom College, her daughter Lettie, and her husband George.  ""Our thoughts, condolences and sympathies are with their families at this tragic time."" The school added: ""The College is working with the police in what remains an ongoing investigation. We must now focus on the welfare and wellbeing of our pupils and staff, and work to ensure that they receive all the comfort, warmth and support required from the Epsom College community."" The college concluded the statement by saying: ""We ask that the public and the media respect the privacy of Emma's family, and help us to prioritise the needs of our pupils. ""The news is heartbreaking and we need time and space to come together and process these shocking events. No further statement will be issued at this time."" Police say the family's next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers. An investigation has been launched to establish the circumstances of their deaths. Detective Chief Inspector Kimball Edey said: ""On behalf of Surrey Police, my team, and I, I first want to express my sincerest condolences to the friends and family of Emma, Lettie and George, as well as to the students and staff of Epsom College, for their tragic loss.  ""I want to give my assurance that we will conduct a thorough investigation into what took place last night, and hope to be able to bring some peace in these traumatic circumstances. I would ask that their privacy is respected at this very difficult time."" Inspector Jon Vale, Epsom and Ewell's borough commander, said: ""We're aware that this tragic incident will have caused concern and upset in the local community. ""While this is believed to be an isolated incident, in the coming days our local officers will remain in the area to offer reassurance to students, parents, teachers and the local community. ""I would like to thank the school and the community for their understanding and patience while the investigation continues."" Surrey Police said the three deaths have been reported to the coroner. Dr Alastair Wells, chair of the board of governors at Epsom College, said: ""On behalf of everyone at Epsom College, I want to convey our utter shock and disbelief at this tragic news. ""Our immediate thoughts and condolences are with Emma's family, friends and loved ones, and to the many pupils and colleagues whose lives she enriched throughout her distinguished career.   ""Emma was a wonderful teacher, but most of all she was a delightful person. In time we will commemorate Emma and her family, in the appropriate way, and in line with the wishes of her family. ""But for now, we ask that we are all given the time, space and respect we need to come to terms with this tragic loss."" Mrs Pattison became Epsom's first female head in September 2022 after six years as headteacher of Croydon High School in south London. Boarding students at the college pay more than £42,000 a year and its alumni include Conservative MP Sir Michael Fallon, broadcaster Jeremy Vine and comedian Tim Vine. Over 850 boys and girls attend the school, which was founded in 1853, and its acting head has been listed as Paul Williams. Mrs Pattison's husband George was a chartered accountant who was the director of a management consultancy firm called Tanglewood 2016, according to Companies House.

Grieving mum forced to live in home where daughter died after swallowing a button battery,"Stacy-Marie Nicklin is desperate to move from the house where her two-year-old daughter died, but a row with contractors is preventing her from entering a new propertyA grieving mum says she is desperate to move house amid a long-standing dispute over the electricity supply at her new property. Stacy-Marie Nicklin, from Stoke-on-Trent, has been waiting since October to move out of the home where her two-year-old daughter Harper-Lee Fanthorpe swallowed a button battery in May 2021. But despite packing her entire life up, as well as forking out several times for removal men and taking unpaid days off work, the move has been repeatedly called off. With her current house full of painful memories, she wants to move to one of five nearby new-builds, but this has been delayed by a stand-off over a trench where the utilities connections go.   Stacy, 37, told StokeonTrentLive that the situation is taking a heavy toll on her as well as daughters Kylie, 14, and 19-year-old Jamie-Leigh. She said: “After Harper died, I tried but just couldn’t carry on living here, because of all the painful memories. This living room is where Harper was bleeding from the mouth as the battery burned her insides.  ""I couldn’t take being here again on her birthday or at Christmas, so we looked for somewhere new. “We were all set to move months ago, and then just as we were about to go they’d tell us it had been delayed because of something to do with the electrics. But every time I went past the house, there was no sign of any work being done.  ""In the meantime, we were living out of boxes and I was having to take days off work, only to be let down at the last minute.” In September last year, Staffs Housing, which is the housing association behind the scheme, had reportedly told Stacy it was hopeful the tenancies could begin in October, 2022.  Then, in later messages, it warned that there were “a few bits that needed to be completed” and said the handover date might be December 2. But on December 1, a problem arose around one piece of work still outstanding, and left everything up in the air.  SAS Associates, which was due to complete the electrical connections, reportedly says it was told by the city council that a complaint had been made about the length of the pedestrian diversion - which it says the council had previously approved.  The contractor says it said it would make relevant changes - including replacing signs that had apparently been stolen - but was told the “change to traffic management” couldn’t be approved until January. The works were closed down and the hole filled. And SAS says that its revised bill for opening up the hole, making the changes to diversion, and finishing the work, was rejected by the developer, Arthur Roberts & Sons Ltd. A spokesman for Kamar Developments, the sub-contractors on site, said: “We want people to be in there, as soon as possible because I want to be out, I want the job finished. “I can assure you we’ve done our utmost to get this sorted but it’s the independent connections provider, SAS Utilities. They’ve turned around and said ‘We’re not coming back until you’ve paid this variation in full,’ which obviously at the moment I’m not prepared to do.  “Don’t get me wrong, the houses are done, they’re finished. But the problem is we can't get the completion certificates sorted because I can’t do the inspection and testing until the electricity is connected.” A Kamar Developments spokesman said the bill received from SAS is to the tune of £16,000. SAS said the initial sum for the final connection work had been set back in September at £9,000 as long as there were no variations.  But it says the extra work as a result of the complaint in December means that the job has changed, and “under our terms and conditions works cannot be undertaken until variations are agreed”. With work now at a standstill, Stacy said: “I would just beg them all to sort this out. We can’t expect them to have known the impact this is having, but it’s just dragging our nightmares out for longer and longer.    ""We’re so desperate to move and get out of this house, we’d dig the hole ourselves if we needed to.” The city council, which manages the housing waiting list, said it is in touch with Staffs Housing over Stacy’s move. Tim Sheail, Director of Housing Services at Staffs Housing, said he had every sympathy with Stacy and the other families affected, adding: “Dividy Road is a new development of five houses which are being built by an independent contractor.  ""The project has been significantly delayed because of problems with utility connections which are beyond our direct control. “We really sympathise with Stacy and the other residents who were due to move into their new homes last year. We understand how frustrating the delays are and realise how difficult this has been.  ""Our Housing Team has been in regular contact with all future residents and we will continue to do all we can to support them.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/grieving-mum-forced-live-home-29142921
"Woman loses £14,500 after falling for man on Facebook group in romance con","Mary and her online partner sent each other messages daily and occasionally spoke over the phone, he also sent pictures of himself in different places and with his daughter, so Mary believed he was who he said he wasA woman was conned out of nearly £15,000 after falling victim to a romance scam which started on a Faceboom group.  Mary gave £14,500 to her 'partner' to help them out during a time of need, little she did know it was a con and he took the cash and disappeared without a trace. Mary, whose name has been changed, joined a Facebook group for fans of a popular film and not long after she’d joined, Mary received a private message from another member of the group, called Bill. They chatted on Facebook Messenger for a while, until Bill convinced Mary to move the conversation to WhatsApp, where their conversations became less about the film and more about their personal lives. The two chatted daily and spoke over the phone on occasion. Bill also sent Mary photos of himself in different places, and some with a person he claimed was his daughter.   After chatting for a while, Bill told Mary his bank account had been blocked and he couldn't get to his money and shared images of apparent bank statements which showed he had £1million pending release. Mary helped Bill out by sending gift cards and small chunks of cash however, things apparently took an even worse turn for Bill as he then told Mary his daughter was seriously ill and needed money urgently to cover her treatment.  Bill sent Mary pictures of his daughter lying in a hospital bed and she apparently spoke to the Doctor caring for her.  Bill asked Mary for help and she agreed to help cover the hospital bills and sent £14,500 to an obscure account. When Mary said she was unable to send more cash, Bill told her to take out a loan and this was where the scam became apparent.  Mary shared her concern with her daughter-in-law who persuaded her to not send any more cash and convinced her that she had been the victim of a romance scam from the start. Lloyds Bank shared Mary's story along with a warning as the number of romance scam victims has risen by 30% over the last year with social media and online dating apps being a common source of the scam. The high street bank says the average amount lost by each victim was around £8,234 and said the most common age group to fall victim are those between 65 and 74. Lloyds shared the story of one woman who lost nearly £15,000 to her fake partner and urged customers to be vigilant and look out for the signs of a romance scam. Lloyds Bank noted that ""Romance Scams"" often leave victims struggling with significant emotional trauma as not only do they have to deal with the financial impact, but they also have to come to terms with the fact that their relationship – which may have been cultivated over months or even years – is not real.  How does a typical romance scam work? Lloyds highlighted that scammers usually target victims on social media platforms, particularly on Facebook, or dating apps, such as Tinder.  Once someone has been targeted the scammer might quickly try to move the conversation onto another private messaging platform, like WhatsApp.  Typically, the scammer may come across as ""very caring and attentive"" over a period of time to ""build trust"" and give the impression that the relationship is genuine. Often they will claim to be living or working abroad to explain why they can’t meet in person and they may invent reasons why they can’t turn their camera on during calls. Eventually, they will start to tell stories about family or legal issues, business problems or medical bills. Usually, the amounts could be small, to begin with, but over time they convince their victim to send more and more money.  Liz Ziegler, fraud prevention director at Lloyds Bank said: “The sad truth is there was never any genuine connection, with criminals ruthlessly targeting multiple victims at the same time, and disappearing with the money as soon as they get found out. “While online dating should be a fun and empowering experience, it’s vital that people are able to spot the warning signs, to keep both themselves and their loved ones safe.""  Five warnings signs of a possible romance scam  Sudden online romance with someone who seems a perfect match  Profile pictures that appear professional or ‘model-like’  Quickly moving the conversation to a different platform or app  Reluctance to appear on camera or meet in person  Requests for financial support, whatever the story or amounts   Liz added: “If you’ve started an online relationship and the discussion turns to money – regardless of the reason or the amounts involved – then alarm bells should be ringing. “Never send money to people you’ve never met in person, no matter how much you’ve spoken online. Talking to a real-life friend or family member can be a good way to sense check what’s going on.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/woman-loses-14500-after-falling-29143074
Nicola Bulley's daughter says 6 heartbreaking words as she spots teams searching for mum,"An emotional video has captured the moment missing Nicola Bulley's six-year-old daughter responds to a search team looking for her mum more than a week after she disappearedThe six-year-old daughter of Nicola Bulley reacts to the search for her mum in a poignant moment caught on camera. Nicola, 45, disappeared shortly after dropping off her two children at school in Lancashire on January 27, with police unable so far to find a conclusive explanation of what happened to her. She was last seen walking her dog next to the River Wyre in in St Michael's on Wyre at 9.10am that morning, before going missing at an unknown point between then and 9.35am, when her phone was found on a bench and her dog off its lead. Hundreds of volunteers joined the search for the mum-of-two on Sunday for the 10th day of the operation. The search was focused along the riverbank, as investigators believe she may have fallen into the River Wyre during her walk.   A specialist diver team was also called in after an initial offer was reportedly rejected by Lancashire Police. Amid the tragedy, a heartbreaking moment came this weekend when friends of Nicola shared a six second video with Sky News, in which her six-year-old daughter Sophia points at a search team helicopter. The little girl is heard saying: ""Them helicopters, they're looking for mummy.""  It comes after Nicola's 73-year-old dad Ernest spoke last week of the effect of her disappearance on the children, Harriet, 9, and Sophia, 6, and family. He told The Mirror: ""When I look at the kids I have to go out of the room because I can’t hold it together.  ""They are asking where mummy is and ‘when is mummy coming home’, it’s so hard, I just don’t know what’s happened.""  He added that the children still believed ""mummy is coming home soon"" but admitted if ""this keeps going on and on I don’t know where we are going to go or what to say to them."" Lancashire Police are keeping an ""open mind"" to all scenarios but said they do not believe Nicola has been attacked.  A close friend has meanwhile shared a plea for online trolls to stop causing ""hurt and distress"" to the family by speculating on the causes of her disappearance. Tilly said she had ""shocked and appalled"" by some coverage of her friend's disappearance and listed a series of facts she believes the public should know before commenting on the case.

Inside eerie abandoned shopping centre where every store has shut ahead of demolition,"Crossways shopping centre once attracted shoppers from across the country, including the likes of actor and filmmaker Sir Richard Attenborough, but has now become a ghost townA once vibrant shopping centre has become a ghost town after years of neglect and vandalism.  New photos show the eerily quiet and deserted Crossways shopping centre in Paignton, Devon, which was once visited by celebrities including actor and filmmaker Sir Richard Attenborough.  The shopping centre saw its last shop - Cancer Research UK - close its doors last year, signalling the end. Torbay Council has decided to demolish the site and replace it with 90 units of sheltered and care housing for people with disabilities to live independently. Graffiti is now scrawled across the shopping centre's walls and overgrown weeds make their home through the cracks in the paving.   DevonLive was given a final look around the dilapidated shopping centre to explore the ghostly ruins. A view directly from the top of Crossways leads down to dark and lonely corridors once bustling with shoppers. The now walled-off shopping centre has fallen apart in its isolation.  Here the glass-clad stairwell leads to a deserted car park once full of the cars of busy shoppers. According to Project Manager Paul Munro, the car park is said to be the most difficult part of the demolition because it's made of strong reinforced concrete. The view from the Hyde Road entrance paints a similar ghostly picture of the deserted shopping centre.  Once again, weeds and graffiti cement their place amongst the empty shops, including the Crossways Pharmacy and a fabric shop. The Sean Hickey Studio, once a photography shop at No.2 Crossways, now sits empty. Sean Hickey sadly passed away in 2017 but his legacy lives on.  The council has arranged for original signs above the door to be presented back to the Hickey family as a lasting memory of their time in Crossways. Whilst on site the Hickey Family said: “As a family, in late 2022 we visited his old shop and to our surprise discovered that some of the original signage was still in place. ""After knowing this, we put a request in to Torbay Council to salvage as much of the shop signage as possible. Sean passed away in 2017 and having a piece of him back is a great comfort to us and his legacy. ""Thank you to Torbay Council for making this happen for us.""

Millions don't need to pay this one 'priority' bill for the next two months,"Most local authorities offer alternative payment methods for Council Tax to help spread the cost, and you can choose which one suits you the bestMillions of people will not have to pay for one key household bill for the next two months.  Council tax is paid by the majority of households in the UK, but some households will not have to pay it for February and March this year.  This is because these households have chosen to pay their Council Tax across 10 monthly instalments rather than 12.  Most local authorities offer alternative payment methods such as this to help spread the cost, and you can choose which one suits you the best.  You can choose to pay your full bill in a lump sum, or through instalments throughout the year.  Council tax bills for the coming year, this year it will be for the 2023-24 tax year, are usually issued on or before April 30 and you will usually need to decide how you would like to pay when your new council tax bill comes through.  Most councils will not allow you to change how many monthly instalments you pay once your next financial year has started, which means you need to decide and confirm it beforehand.  You can tell your council what you prefer through your council's website and once you have done this you will be told exactly how much you have to pay across the year. You can also do this over the phone.  You will also be told how your council tax is worked out and the specific dates you have to pay. The total bill is the same whether you are paying across 10 months or 12, it is the amount you pay each month which differs. So, if your annual bill is £1,500, then you will pay £150 each month over ten months with two months off or £125 a month over 12 months with no break.  Councils prefer to receive payment by direct debit, but you can also pay by cash, cheque or debit card.  Most councils accept payment online, over the phone, or by standing order, some councils also accept credit card payments. Council tax bills are considered to be a ""priority payment"" and failing to pay your bill on time can result in serious consequences.

Emma told the school's podcast: “In terms of transition it’s been a really big change for my family. We’ve moved house - we’ve bought a dog.  “I’ve got a new job, my husband has got a new job, that wasn’t meant to happen but it did and my daughter has started a new school so there’s been a lot of change for us as a family.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-epsom-college-head-teacher-29140796
How household appliance mistake could be adding up to £340 to your energy bills,"When your electrical appliances age, they lose their efficiency and to function properly they start consuming a lot more energy which then in turn runs up the cost of your energy billOne appliance mistake could be running up the cost of your energy bill by around £340.  Over the last year, millions across the UK have been trying their hardest to reduce their energy consumption to lower their bills.  However, many are not aware that the age of your appliance can have a massive impact on the energy it uses and could actually be costing you more, even when you are cutting down.  There can be several things with an older appliance that can result in the consumption of more energy.  For instance, if the seal of the freezer is faulty, your freezer will have more cycles than it usually does which can add to your bill as the freezer is overworking and using more power to cool the contents. Stephen Hankinson, Managing Director at Electric Radiators Direct told Ideal Home that running an ""outdated"" fridge could cost you up to 1,000 kWh per year which based on the current prices equates to around £340.  He added: ""So updating old appliances for newer models, where feasible, could mean a considerable saving in the long run.""  William Hobbs, energy expert at My Job Quote told Ideal Home that the energy efficiency of appliances had improved ""dramatically"" over the last few years, mainly due to ""improved technology"" and ""stricter regulations"".  Based on this, William said one of the ""biggest"" and ""most unknown"" energy saving tips would be to check how long you've had an appliance for and switch it out if it is much older than you expected.  If you are financially, or physically able to William says it would be ""well worth it"" in the long term.  He said: ""It’s worth thinking about the appliances that are constantly running, such as the refrigerator and ones that you use often, like the oven or your TV. Chances are, if you were to purchase newer models, you could find yourself saving hundreds, if not, thousands on the cost to run those appliances during their lifespan."" As a guide, William highlighted the typical lifespan of an average appliance can be:    Washing machine - 20 years Freezer - 10-12 years Microwave - 8-10 years Toaster - 6 years Tumble Dryer - 10-15 years  Boiler - 12-20 years  Vacuum cleaner - 7-9 years  Dishwasher - 7-12 years  If you have had a certain appliance longer than the average lifespan, it may be time to consider getting a new one, or if that is not an option for you right now, you may want to have your appliance serviced.  An expert can come and take a look at your appliance and then can advise you on whether it can be used for another few years and how it can be improved to help save you money in the long run.  If you are able to splurge on a new one, you should be looking at appliances which have an energy label rating of A+++. This rating is classed as being the most efficient, whilst G is the lowest.  You should also check the total kWh needed to run the appliance for an entire year, which can be found on the label. This can help you calculate the cost to run it and whether this option is the best for your home and energy lifestyle.

Haunting last posts of Epsom College head found dead with husband and daughter at school,"The headteacher of £42,000-a-year Epsom College was found dead along with her husband and seven-year-old daughter on Sunday, with her last posts online praising the school's focus on wellbeingThe headteacher of Epsom College celebrated winning an award in one of her last posts on social media before she was discovered dead on school grounds along with her family.

Woman who took Prince Harry’s virginity 'had to tell dad' after royal wrote about it,"Sasha Walpole revealed herself as the mysterious 'older woman' that Prince Harry wrote about in his book, Spare, in which he claimed he lost his virginity in a field behind a busy pub - the now mum-of-two says she was forced to speak outPrince Harry’s ""older woman"", who had a five minute romp with him behind a busy pub, was forced to finally tell her dad what happened after the royal revealed intimate details of their time together.  Sasha Walpole said she was forced to speak out and share her side of the story after the Duke of Sussex wrote about their tryst in his memoirs.  In his bombshell memoir, Spare, Harry detailed how a mystery “older woman” took his virginity in a field and “smacked my rump and sent me off to graze”. But Ms Walpole, who is just two years older than him, has said the Prince forced her into speaking out after she kept mute on the five minute fumble for more than 20 years. The two are said to have got together in a field behind a busy Wiltshire pub in the summer of 2001, on Ms Walpole's 19th birthday. But she has now had to explain to her dad what had happened after the Prince’s explosive memoirs detailed the encounter.   Sasha told The Sun: “I don’t understand why he went into such detail. He could have said that he lost his virginity and left it at that. “He has done this to my privacy because I was going to keep my head down and not talk about it. If it wasn’t in the book none of this would be happening.” Ms Walpole said she told her mum, Lyn, 65, the day after it happened but her dad Tony, 71, didn't learn until 21 years later and only then cause Harry spilled the beans first. She said she had thought she’d told Tony the same day told she told Lyn, but he “hadn’t listened because he didn’t want to hear about what his teenage daughter was doing.”  The married mum-of-two only went public after Spare set off a “ticking time bomb”. She said telling her dad was awkward because Harry had written about her slapping his backside, and it was ""really cringey"" After it was released, Ms Walpole said her phone began exploding with texts and jokes about the incident and she feared she’d be exposed. So she took it into her own hands to speak out before someone did so for her. The former Highgrove Groom previously said the June 2001 encounter was a “wham-bam” between friends, where she ended up losing her belt.  The mum-of-two said the booze-fuelled sex happened outside a Wiltshire pub, where Prince William had also been that night. Detailing the night, Ms Walpole said that Harry made the first move for their “moment of passion”. There were some discrepancies between the two accounts however, with the Duke claiming he was 17 at the time, but Ms Walpole’s story saying it was during the summer of 2001 - when he was 16.  After deciding to go public, she recalled having to ring her dad on her way to do a food shop at Morrisons.   But as she talked about her romping-prince-shaped dilemma she began to realise her dad was clueless to what had happened. It was only later after talking to her mum that they realised he hadn’t listened all those years ago. Ms Walpole met Harry whilst working at a groom at his dad's Highgrove House home and on the night they had been celebrating her 19th birthday. She said the pair had downed ten shots before going outside and climbing into the field behind the pub. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/woman-who-took-prince-harrys-29141371
Weather maps show terrifying blizzard with up to 6cm of snow creeping toward UK this week,"A polar vortex could bring about temperatures of -10C in some parts of the UK, with forecasters predicting the cold spell to last into March and refusing to rule out another Beast from the East Parts of the UK could be hit by snow again this month, as weather maps show a blizzard heading our way.  Brits will see temperatures plummet in the coming days as a 1,000-mile-wide polar vortex is set to bring another freezing spell. Meteorological maps showed a band of snow moving towards Scotland, with up to 6cm set to fall in parts of west Scotland and the Highlands from Wednesday onwards. Meanwhile, Met Office forecasters have issued a cold weather alert with reports of temperatures in some parts of the country colder than Iceland. A Met Office spokesperson said: ""From Sunday to Tuesday will be cold, with overnight frost widespread in the south-east and the risk of freezing fog patches. ""It will be rather cold compared to the average by day, with frosts possible overnight.""   Weather experts said colder air from continental Europe is set to hit the UK, bringing with it icy conditions and overnight temperatures as low as -10C in the North. ""Colder air from continental Europe is expected to cross the country,"" the spokesperson added. ""This high-pressure system will act to block wet and windy weather from the Atlantic. ""There will be some frosty nights and colder days, with daytime temperatures in mid or low single figures.""  The mercury will hit an overnight low of -3C in the south, rising to just 4C to 7C in the daytime. Health experts at the UK Health Security Agency meanwhile have issued a Level 2 alert for cold weather. Forecasters meanwhile have predicted the threat from the polar vortex could last until March, with Brits not out of the woods until early Spring. The same weather phenomenon caused 2018's infamous Beast from the East, when the UK ground to a halt from blizzards that lasted for more than a week in March that year.  While long-range forecasts are yet to confirm a period of snow, forecasters said they are keeping regular tabs on the North Pole. The 10-14 day timeframe suggests mid-February potentially could see a widespread blanket. But beyond February, a repeat of previous years when snow has covered the entire UK in the first week of March cannot be ruled out.

Return train tickets could be SCRAPPED forcing Brits to buy two singles for every trip,"Transport Secretary Mark Harper is reportedly poised to announce the end of returns in favour of two singles costing the same in plans to merge British rail servicesReturn train fares could be scrapped as part of a major railway shake up which could also see paper tickets phased out for QR codes.  Two-way tickets, which often work out slightly cheaper, will no longer be available under the reforms expected to be announced this week. If the change is confirmed, passengers will be forced to buy two singles for the same price instead. The shake up follows a trial by LNER in 2020 getting rid of returns. Transport Secretary Mark Harper is expected to unveil the reforms in a speech on Tuesday, where he will outline plans for 'Great British Railways' - a new public body which will merge the way train services and tickets and timetabling are operated.   Part of the overhaul could spell the end for printed tickets, with reports Mr Harper plans to begin a transition to digital tickets and contactless travel cards similar to London's Oyster cards instead. Transport Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan told MPs in October that the Government had axed its plan to introduce a Transport Bill during the current parliamentary session because legislation to deal with the energy crisis was being prioritised. The now-axed Bill included plans to bring in Great British Railways (GBR), absorbing state-owned Network Rail which manages rail infrastructure, and issuing contracts to private companies to run trains, The Telegraph reports.  The body was due to begin operating in early 2024 but that timetable has been scrapped. GBR was a policy first tabled by former Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who claimed it will focus on “bringing everything together and running a much more efficient service for passengers”. The proposals come amidst a crisis point for British rail, with figures for December showing that even without strikes, nearly one in every 12 services was cancelled.

Nicola Bulley: Police call in extra dive squad in river search for missing dog walker,"Nicola Bulley went missing on the morning of Friday, 27, January, when out walking the family dog and there has been no sign of the missing mum in the nine days sincePolice have called in extra divers in their ongoing search for missing mum Nicola Bulley - despite reportedly initially refusing their assistance. Nicola Bulley, 45, vanished on Friday, 27 January, whilst out on a dog walk along the River Wyre, in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire. The mortgage advisor had just dropped her two daughters off at school, and bumped into a number of other walkers in the area, before last being seen at 9.10am. Sometime between then and 9.35am, when her phone was found on a bench and her dog off its lead, the mum went missing. Police said their working hypothesis is that the mum fell into the River Wyre. Peter Faulding, a forensics expert who runs Specialist Group International, offered his services to Lancashire Police in the ongoing search for the mum.   SPI already operates as the underwater search team for police forces across the south west, but had its offer rejected initially, he said. After appearing on Sky News, he made the offer to use his men and resources to help find the mum. But, he said Lancashire Police declined his offer, despite the family themselves pleading with him to find a way to make it happen.  He wrote: ""Unfortunately, Lancashire police have responded via the family declining my offer saying they will continue with their own river searches using their current resources let us know if we are required. ""This potentially adds further delay when all hands on deck are required to help Nicola’s grieving family, either to find her or definitively rule the river out. Time is of the essence and I would like to state that my offer to assist in the search is not in an attempt to take over or criticise what the police are doing. Its purely to bring extra valuable resources to this difficult search for the good of the family.   ""We are the official underwater search team for Essex Kent Surrey Sussex Thames Valley and Hampshire police forces so therefore we are not amateurs and have a proven track record for locating missing persons quickly. ""Myself and my team will remain on standby for deployment to help this poor family should Lancashire Police change their mind. #nicolabulley"". However, just a few hours after that, he said his offer had since been accepted, and then said: ""I have just had a long call with the Lancashire Police search adviser to discuss the search for Nicola. We will work closely with the police search teams who are working long hours to find Nicola.  ""The team are leaving shortly from our base in Dorking on route to Lancashire to start tomorrow morning. #NicolaBulley"". This comes as this afternoon a pal of Nicola's released the last known images of the mum, as she packed her car readying to take her kids to school. Images taken from a doorbell camera showed her getting ready to set off on the 3.8-mile journey from her home. Dressed in her walking boots, and hooded raincoat, she is seen opening the boot of the family car as her dog Willow gets in the back.  She then drove around 10 minutes from her home in Inskip to drop her two children at school in St Michael's on Wyre in Lancashire.  After that, she went missing when out walking her family's dog, Willow. Hundreds of volunteers joined the search for the mum-of-two today as police scoured a riverbank. Police believe she may have fallen into the water while out walking her dog. Police are keen to sweep the river, as they revealed this week it was their belief that the mum fell into the River Wyre.  Lancashire Police's Superintendent Sally Riley said today that their “main working hypothesis” is that she fell into the River Wyre and that “this is not suspicious but a tragic case of a missing person”. She told reporters at the village hall: ""We have not found Nicola - but our search continues."" Supt Riley said their search had stretched 15 kilometres to the coast, officers have combed CCTV and dashcam footage and gone door-to-door to try and paint a picture of what happened. She said from this they were able to determine that Nicola did not leave the riverside. Inquiries so far have left a 10-minute window in which police say they cannot account for Ms Bulley's movements last Friday. A spokesperson for Lancashire Police confirmed to the Mirror they received SGI's offer and took it up after speaking to Nicola's family.

Rishi Sunak 'to hold Cabinet reshuffle TODAY' after Nadhim Zahawi sacking,"The Prime Minister was left with a party chief when he fired Nadhim Zahawi for breaching ministerial rules amid a major row over the Tory chairman's tax affairsRishi Sunak is expected to carry out a mini reshuffle today to replace sacked Tory chairman Nadhim Zahawi. The Prime Minister was left with a party chief when he fired Mr Zahawi for breaching ministerial rules amid a major row over his tax affairs. He is expected to announce a successor as soon as this morning - with further appointments to come as he battles to get a grip after weeks of bad headlines. A government source told the Times said that the reshuffle would be “relatively limited”, with a “domino” effect of movement triggered by the appointment of the new Tory chairman. Trade Minister Greg Hands is one of the names in the frame to succeed Mr Zahawi after the post has sat empty for more than a week. Other reports suggested there could be a shake-up at the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, which could be carved up into different ministries.   Mr Sunak vowed to create a standalone energy department during last summer's Tory leadership contest. Business could be merged with Trade, raising questions about the futures of both Business Secretary Grant Shapps and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch, who made it to the last four of the summer leadership race. Mr Sunak could create a Science and Digital unit, carving out digital from the Culture, Media and Sport department, according to The Sun. Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan is expecting a baby and has said she will take a short maternity leave, making her the second top minister to do so after Suella Braverman.  Under-fire Deputy PM Dominic Raab is likely to stay in post while an independent probe into a string of bullying allegations against him is completed. Downing Street has resisted calls to sack Mr Raabe and repeatedly said that top KC Adam Tolley must be allowed to complete his investigation. Eight formal complaints - said to involve at least 24 officials - are being probed from Mr Raab's stints at the Ministry of Justice, the Foreign Office and the now defunct Brexit department. A weekly meeting of the Cabinet in Downing Street has been pushed back from 9.30am, suggesting appointments are expected to begin imminently. It comes after weeks of bad headlines for the Prime Minister over his scandal-hit ministers as he struggles to turn around his party's dire poll ratings. His pledge to govern with ""integrity, professionalism and accountability"" when he entered No10 more than a 100 days ago was called into question by the row over Mr Zahawi's tax affairs and the bullying claims dogging Mr Raab.

Liz Truss moans it's 'unfair' to blame her for economic chaos - but won't return to No10,"Liz Truss has claimed it is 'unfair' for struggling families to blame her for spiralling mortgage rates - but in a small bit of good news, she said 'no' when asked if she would like to be PM againWhining Liz Truss has claimed it is “unfair” for struggling families to blame her for soaring mortgage rates. The unapologetic ex-PM today refused to accept responsibility for tanking the economy as she continued her shameless bid to whitewash her appalling record. In her first interview since leaving No10, Ms Truss dismissed complaints that households have been lumbered with higher mortgage costs thanks to her botched mini-Budget. But in a small bit of good news, the walking disaster zone said “no” when asked if she would like to be PM again. Ms Truss was forced out of Downing Street after just 49 days after she announced a tax-cutting bonanza, with giveaways for the super-rich.   The carnage sent the pound tumbling and mortgage rates soaring - as pension funds came close to collapse. She had to U-turn on nearly all her plans and sacked her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, but was still forced out by Tory MPs. She is the shortest-serving PM in British history. Asked by the Spectator if she regrets running for the top job, Ms Truss said: “No, I don’t regret it.” But on the possibility of making a comeback, she said “no” when questioned on whether she would like to return to No10. She added: “I definitely want to be part of promoting a pro-growth agenda, I definitely want to carry on as an MP. I’m positive about the future of Britain and I’m positive about the future of the Conservative Party. “I think we need to start building more of a strong intellectual base. But I’m not desperate to get back into Number 10, no.” Mortgage rates have risen dramatically since Ms Truss entered No10 this summer. The cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage stood at an eye-watering 5.75% last month, according to Moneyfacts, compared to 3.95% in August, the month before her disastrous mini-budget.  It is estimated 1.4million people will have to renew their mortgage this year, meaning they will be stung by the higher interest rates. Despite the catastrophic end to her premiership, Ms Truss said she would keep pushing for tax cuts. “We need to be better at making the argument,” she told the Spectator. “ We need to think about making the argument. “Obviously, I’ve got more time available now to think about these things and make the argument. And that’s what I want to do.” She added: “I believe that I’ve learnt a lot in my time in government, I understand what some of the pitfalls are, I’ve been through the mill on this and we do need to do things differently.” Pushed on whether people struggling with higher mortgage rates would think she is the right person to be making economic arguments, Ms Truss said: “I do want to address this - because we’ve been living in a very low interest rate world and mortgage rates have been going up.” She said there was a “specific issue around the time” of her mini-Budget related to problems with pension funds. “So I don’t think it’s fair to blame interest rises on what we did. I think that’s unfair,” she added. In a surprising admission, Ms Truss said neither she nor Mr Kwarteng had been aware of problems with pension funds. “The fact is we didn’t know about the issue,” she said. “We didn’t necessarily understand the issue, and that is a difficult position to be in as PM and chancellor.” Labour leader Keir Starmer dismissed Ms Truss’s economic advice as he demanded a general election. Speaking to broadcasters in Bristol, he said: ""I have to say, my heart sank at the idea of former prime ministers taking the stage to tell us about what they did. They did huge damage to our country and to our economy. ""And there are millions of people across the country still paying the price for the failures, well, 13 years failure of this Conservative government, so what the country needs is for us to move forward. ""We're not going be able to do that until we have a general election now and a fresh start under Labour.” Tory MP Caroline Nokes urged Ms Truss to keep quiet. “A period of silence would be helpful,” she told the BBC’s Politics Live.

Rishi Sunak and Steve Barclay accused of being 'on strike' from addressing NHS crisis,"Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting slammed Rishi Sunak and Steve Barclay for failing to negotiate with health unions and put an end to strikes - as ambulance workers and nurses both walked out today at the same time The Prime Minister and the Health Secretary have been accused of themselves being 'on strike' during the NHS strikes.   Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting slammed Rishi Sunak and Steve Barclay for failing to negotiate with health unions and put an end to strikes.  Mr Streeting said: ""The General secretary of the RCN has written to the Prime Minister but she has not heard anything from the Government for weeks. ""It looks to the country like the Prime Minister and the Health Secretary are the ones on strike. Where is the Prime Minister? Where is the Health Secretary? ""In the week of the biggest strikes in the history of the NHS, during the biggest crisis the NHS has ever faced, the Health Secretary wasn't available for interviews this morning, he's not available to MPs today, and we're meant to believe that at four o'clock in the afternoon he's talking about how to avert disruption that has been taking place all day. Don't make me laugh.""   Health minister Will Quince, who responded on Mr Barclay's behalf, said the Health Secretary was in a Cobra meeting so could not be in the Houses of Commons. He also said Mr Barclay did a TV interview earlier that day. However, the Health Secretary was absent from the main media round in the morning. Health unions have repeatedly said they will call off strike action if they can negotiate with the Government in the ongoing pay dispute relating to this financial year. But Mr Barclay is refusing to do that. Instead, the Government has been insisting it was moving on to 2023/23 pay talks - despite 2022/23 still being unresolved. During a visit to Kingston Hospital in south-west London today, he again said: ""I don't think it's right to go back to last year to last April, retrospectively. ""We should be looking forward to the pay review body that is taking evidence now and working constructively with the trade unions, to ensure that the evidence that goes to the pay review body reflects the wider pressure that the NHS has been under.""  Nurses from the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and ambulance workers from the GMB union walked out at the same time for the first time today in what is the biggest strike in the history of the NHS.  Nurses will strike again on Tuesday, ambulance workers again on Friday and physiotherapists on Thursday.   Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, speaking to broadcasters at Airbus in Filton, near Bristol, said: ""The widespread strikes today are a badge of shame for the Government.  ""Nobody wants to see these strikes, nobody wants to be on strike - the last thing nurses want to do is to be on strike. ""What they do want is a Government that can show leadership, get around the negotiating table and settle this dispute. ""I think many people listening to this will be absolutely flabbergasted that the Government is still sitting this one out, not showing any leadership in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, making the situation much worse than it otherwise would be."" Responding to Mr Streeting's urgent question put to the government, RCN General Secretary and Chief Executive, Pat Cullen, said: “No Health Secretary and no Business Secretary were there to answer urgent questions in Parliament today – and no response from the Prime Minister after I wrote to him this weekend. People may wonder if the government is also on strike. “In Parliament today we heard more of the same from a government whose most senior figures seem to be missing in action. “The Westminster government is punishing England’s nurses and looking increasingly isolated as the Welsh and Scottish governments come to the table. “It is clearer than ever that the Prime Minister has failed to deliver on his promises to the NHS. Rishi Sunak is letting the country’s most important and beloved institution deteriorate rapidly – but it is not too late. I am urging him to come to the table to negotiate and halt this action now.”  Follow Mirror Politics on    Snapchat   ,    Tiktok   ,    Twitter   and    Facebook   .

"Bus services could be slashed within days without new cash pledge, warns Labour","Labour called on the Government to offer new guarantees under the Bus Recovery Grant as a crunch deadline looms for transport operators and passengersBus companies will start slashing hundreds of services in 10 days unless ministers provide funding guarantees, Labour warned today. The Government’s Bus Recovery Grant is set to expire at the end of March - and operators must give six weeks’ notice of plans to cancel or change routes. Labour’s analysis, based on figures by the Confederation of Passenger Transport released today, reveals more than 1,600 routes could be cut this spring - leaving England with fewer than 10,000 routes for the first time since records began. Over 1,100 routes have been axed in the last year alone. Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh said: “The Conservatives are asleep at the wheel, risking the future of services millions of passengers depend on.” “They have 10 days to act, or services could plunge to a record low.” Read More
  Operators must give 42 days’ notice to the Traffic Commissioner to register changes to or withdrawals of routes. With current funding set to expire from the end of March, the last date for companies to announce cancellations will be February 17 - unless they get certainty from the Government. Buses are the most used mode of public transport in England – with 2.8 billion passenger journeys in 2021/22. But the CPT has warned that up to 15% of bus services in England are at risk unless the Bus Recovery Grant is renewed. Labour said a15% cut would see services fall from 10,941 to 9,300 – a fall of 1,641. It would be the first time they fell below 10,000 since the Traffic Commissioner watchdog began reporting figures. Last April, ministers announced that 31 areas in England, including Liverpool, Norfolk and Cornwall, had been chosen to receive funding from a £1.08bn pot of cash to boost bus services. In March 2021, the Government unveiled its £3bn bus “revolution”, promising “more frequent, reliable, easier to use and cheaper bus services”. The-then Prime Minister Boris Johnson trumpeted the “Bus Back Better” plan, saying: “Buses are lifelines and liberators, connecting people to jobs they couldn’t otherwise take, driving pensioners and young people to see their friends, sustaining town centres and protecting the environment. “As we build back from the pandemic, better buses will be one of our first acts of levelling-up.”  Labour today called on the Government to “give bus operators, communities and local leaders the certainty they need on the future of the Bus Recovery Grant”. The party also urged ministers to “come clean on wider long-term funding for the Bus Back Better strategy”. It said: “Over half of communities are seeing no funding whatsoever from the strategy, leaving the Government’s pledge to transform bus services in tatters.” Ms Haigh added: “After 13 years of the Conservatives, the bus services communities depend on are stumbling from one crisis to the next.” “Labour will reform the broken bus system, giving communities control of their own bus routes and fares, delivering the better bus services that passengers need.” The Department for Transport was contacted for comment. * Follow Mirror Politics on Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter and Facebook ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/bus-services-could-slashed-within-29147556
"Speed-up UK weapons production to replace arms sent to Ukraine, warns Labour","The Shadow Defence Secretary makes the plea in an exclusive Mirror interview before he addresses the Royal United Services Institute think tank on Tuesday eveningBritish weapons production must be bolstered so the UK can defend itself and help arm Ukraine, Labour warned tonight. Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey backed shipping weapons to Kyiv but feared it had left Britain vulnerable. He called on the Ministry of Defence to shift to an “urgent operational footing” to replenish depleted stocks after kit was sent to help President Volodymyr Zelensky’s regime repel Russian forces. “We’ve got to reboot defence plans, we’ve got to boost military production to sustain support for Ukraine and rearm Britain,” said Mr Healey, speaking exclusively to the Mirror. “I’m concerned that we are running down our own military stocks without urgent action to replace them.” In a speech to the London-based Royal United Services Institute think tank on Tuesday, he will call for a “stockpiles strategy” to overhaul a “wasteful peacetime procurement system”.   He is due to tell experts: “We need to shift parts of our defence industry and Ministry of Defence procurement on to an urgent operational footing, both to support Ukraine for the long-term and to replenish UK stocks for any future conflict.” Mr Healey told the Mirror Labour would continue to back the Tories in sending vital gear to Kyiv. “The Government’s had our fullest Labour support for the military assistance we’ve provided to Ukraine and the reinforcement of NATO allies,” he said. “But we’ve got to move from ad-hoc announcements to a long-term plan to support Ukraine - a 2023 and beyond action plan, covering military, economic and humanitarian, diplomatic assistance.” He believed ministers should start work now on building back up UK weapons caches. “We need to replenish our own stockpiles,” he said.  “The MoD should be telling contractors in advance what will be needed so they can plan the ramping up of their capacity to produce.” He added: “They should be putting parts of the procurement system on an urgent operational footing, setting aside some of the rigid rules and protracted processes to get contracts in place and production under way.” The Labour frontbencher called for a long-term plan of military, economic and humanitarian support for Ukraine, which he wants published before the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion on February 24 “to signal to (Vladimir) Putin that things will get worse, not better for Russia.” Mr Healey, a former Communities Minister, said: “The next Government will inherit the Ukraine conflict and Russia’s wider aggression. “With a general election, there may be a change to Labour but there will be no change to Britain’s resolve in confronting Russia’s threats, pursuing Putin’s crimes and standing with Ukraine.” Mr Healey also confirmed Labour would conduct and publish a Strategic Defence and Security Review within its first year back in power.

Tory slams Rishi Sunak's 'phoney war' against European human rights rules,"Conservative Jackie Doyle-Price insisted the Prime Minister should tackle the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats by getting the Home Office into shape rather than trying to pick a fight with the courtsA Tory MP has slammed Rishi Sunak's ""phoney war"" and told him to stop “willy waving” by threatening to take Britain out of European human rights rules to make it easier to deport asylum seekers. Conservative Jackie Doyle-Price insisted the Prime Minister should tackle the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats by getting the Home Office into shape rather than trying to pick a fight with the courts.  In leaked messages from a WhatsApp group, the ex-minister wrote that “willy waving about leaving the ECHR [European Convention on Human Rights] will do zilch”.  “I have been a member of the Conservative Party for 36 years. This group leaves me cold,"" she said. ""Upholding the law should never be a matter for debate for a Conservative. Our Home Office is crap. If the Government wants to have a phone[y] war over the ECHR instead of sorting itself out it can do it without me."" According to the messages, obtained by Politico, fellow Tory Anna Firth backed Ms Doyle-Price, posting that she was “bang on the money” about the ECHR “rabbit hole”.   David Simmonds, another Tory, insisted “the ECHR is not the issue here”. “By pretending it is, we are setting ourselves up for a fall as a UK court will take the same line,” he added. It comes after a report at the weekend that Mr Sunak was prepared to leave the ECHR if the court blocked plans to halt the flow of asylum seekers arriving in small boats. The ECHR was established after the Second World War to protect human rights and political freedoms by politicians including Winston Churchill.  “The PM has been clear he wants to introduce legislation that meets our international obligations,” a source close to Sunak told the Sunday Times “This bill will go as far as possible within international law. We are pushing the boundaries of what is legally possible, while staying within the ECHR. And we are confident that when it is tested in the courts, we will win. “But if this legislation gets onto the statute book and is found to be lawful by our domestic courts, but it is still being held up in Strasbourg, then we know the problem is not our legislation or our courts. “If that’s the case, then of course he will be willing to reconsider whether being part of the ECHR is in the UK’s long-term interests.” Mr Sunak has made curbing small boats crossings a central pledge amid anger from Tory MPs on what they consider to be a critical issue ahead of the next election. Ministers are said to be drawing up plans to make it harder for people to make legal challenges against deportation - including a hard-line plan to block those who arrived in small boats from seeking judicial review. Downing Street insisted the plan would be ""compliant"" with the ECHR. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""I think there has been a great deal of speculation. ""You heard from the Prime Minister himself where he said, first and foremost, he wants to put an end to the exploitation of our laws through reform of the system. ""We will of course comply with all our international obligations, and we are confident the measures being worked through will tackle the problem while being compliant with the ECHR."" Asked whether a ""plan B"" of leaving the ECHR was under consideration, the spokesman replied: ""I wouldn't get into future speculation."" Some 1,442 migrants have crossed the Channel to the UK so far this year, according to Home Office figures. A record 45,755 people succeeded in making the trip in 2022.

The Royal College of Nursing and other unions have called off similar action in Wales after receiving a new pay offer from the Welsh Government. Patricia Marquis, the Royal College of Nursing's (RCN) Director for England urged Rishi Sunak to come to the table and negotiate, telling Times Radio: ""We have asked and called urgently on Rishi Sunak to come to the table to seek a resolution"" She went on: ""We don't want to impact on patients. We don't want to disrupt services.  ""But the reality is, ... every day 1000s of patients operations are being cancelled, because there aren't enough staff to to deliver either the operations or the outpatient services that are needed.

Top Tory admits to spat with 'robust' Dominic Raab who 'tried to get him sacked',"Dominic Raab, who is facing a bullying probe, reportedly tried to get his fellow Tory Sir Robert Buckland fired last August after Sir Robert publicly attacking his plans to tear up human rights legislationA former Cabinet Minister has admitted he had a ""disagreement"" with under-fire Tory Dominic Raab after reports Mr Raab tried to get him sacked.  Ex-Welsh Secretary Sir Robert Buckland said that the pair had clashed over a Telegraph article he wrote criticising Mr Raab's controversial plan for a British Bill of Rights last year - but they have ""moved on now"". Mr Raab allegedly tried to get his fellow Tory fired last August for publicly attacking his plans to tear up human rights legislation. A source told the Times that the now-Deputy PM's behaviour was ""very odd, very punchy"" but Sir Robert did not regard it as bullying. Another source told the paper that Sir Robert informed Rishi Sunak about the “intimidating” and “unacceptable” behaviour during the dying days of Boris Johnson's government last year. But Mr Sunak's allies denied this as the Prime Minister faces mounting questions over what he knew about allegations over Mr Raab's conduct. Mr Raab, who is also Justice Secretary, is being investigated over eight formal complaints of bullying said to involve at least 24 officials during his time in three Government departments. He denies bullying.   Downing Street has repeatedly said that Mr Sunak was not aware of any formal complaints about Mr Raab when he appointed him as Deputy PM in October 2022. But No10 has refused to say if he knew about any informal concerns. When asked whether it was true that Mr Raab issued the threat over the Bill of Rights article, the Tory MP told LBC: ""I don't want to rake back through the coals of what happened last summer. ""Dominic and I have a disagreement about his Bill of Rights, clearly he wasn't going to agree with the article that I did write in the Telegraph. ""I was talking about the Government to come - that is, the Government post-Boris Johnson - and felt that it was entirely appropriate to do that.  ""There are robust disagreements in politics. I'm old enough and ugly enough to hold my own corner, and Dominic is known for his robustness as well. There was a disagreement, but we've moved on."" Asked about Mr Raab's approach, Sir Robert said he was ""at the top end of the robustness scale, I don't think anybody would deny that"". No10 did not comment further on the claims. Asked if Mr Sunak agreed with Sir Robert, the PM's official spokesman said: ""It's not the exact phrase I would put with him. ""I'm simply not going to get into a lot of the speculation and commentary that's been taking place was this investigation is still live."" Senior lawyer Adam Tolley KC was appointed by Mr Sunak to investigate the claims against Mr Raab once it was clear that formal complaints about his conduct had been made. Mr Sunak has faced calls from unions, opposition MPs and even former Tory chairman Sir Jake Berry to suspend Mr Raab while the investigation is carried out. Mr Raab denies allegations of bullying and has said he will cooperate with the probe. He previously said: “I’m ­confident I behaved professionally, and of course the ­Government takes a ­zero-tolerance approach to bullying.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/top-tory-admits-spat-robust-29142837

After being drummed out of Number 10 after just 49 days, Ms Truss has returned with a 4,000 word essay in the Telegraph claiming she'd been right all along, and she just hadn't been given a proper shake. And not one of those 4,000 words was ""sorry"".  The ex-PM blamed everyone from the ""economic establishment"" to Joe Biden for getting in the way of her wild plan for unfunded tax cuts.  She accepted she was not ""blameless"" for nearly crashing the economy, sending hundreds of thousands of Brits spiralling into poverty. In the end, her premiership was outlasted by an iceberg lettuce.  But she complained she was never given a ""realistic chance"" to implement her wild, uncosted tax-cutting rampage because the ""left-wing economic establishment"" got in the way.

 First off, this quote from a Tory source ""She’s more deranged than we realised. ""This is the woman who almost caused a run on the pound and is now pretending she has some answer to our problems.

Then there's the search for the 'left-wing economic establishment'    This brutal comparison   This stark assessment from former Cabinet colleague David Gauke  Writing in the New Statesman, the ex-Tory MP said: ""This is delusional but it raises two concerns for Sunak. First, at a time when the UK is forecast to be the only major economy in recession this year, the Truss analysis may resonate with too many Conservatives. Second, for those who have a better appreciation of what happened last autumn than Truss, it is a reminder that there remain powerful voices in the Conservative Party who cannot be trusted to be economically responsible. It is an unwelcome intervention."" And this diplomatic reaction from a current Tory MP        Meanwhile, people noticed Ms Truss had a painting mashing up Che Guevara and Lord Nelson on her wall for some reason   In fairness, there were a few people defending what Liz Truss had to say...

"'There's nothing selfish about striking for deep, profound change. It shows who cares'","My better half joined her colleagues from the ­teaching profession ­striking in central London last week. She’d do it again. She’s proud of her long-term commitment to the kids she teaches. She cares about their academic wellbeing, whatever special needs they have and her part in creating a future for them. Likewise my sister, a ­headteacher who’s had to discreetly provide breakfast for kids in her office and counsel parents in difficult situations. They don’t tell you about that kind of thing when they demonise teachers. The critics carp at so-called selfish educators demanding better pay when the truth is they aren’t paid enough. Not when the time they hope to spend with their families is spent marking work and making lesson plans. Not when they return home late because a child’s mum or dad hasn’t picked them up.   We clap for carers then buy into the BS sold to us by politicians who don’t want to pay them what they are worth.   No one who works 40 hours a week should live in poverty or use a food bank. Yet many nurses, teachers, public sector workers and those who go beyond the call find themselves there when they should be rewarded for their efforts.  So when they say enough is enough, I back them. Sure it frustrates me not being able to go about my daily life. But I’ve been more frustrated at my kids sitting in classes of 30-plus because schools don’t have the teachers to reduce that number. I’ve been more frustrated waiting in A&E for more than four hours when they haven’t had the staff to cope with demand. People are stretched to breaking point, forced to leave their professions rather than bust their bones for a pittance. Individuals like Mick Lynch are framed as “union barons” for simply articulating the concerns of those for whom striking is a last resort. On Monday, 10 chief nurses warned the Government that its intransigence over NHS pay is placing patients in danger. It came as tens of thousands of workers staged the biggest strike in the NHS’s history. Harry Truman said in 1952: “Socialism is a scare word they’ve hurled at every advance the people have made. Socialism is what they called public power, social security… anything that helps all people.” In the US, two million hospitality and leisure jobs are unfilled in what ­economists are calling a “deep, profound” shift in the labour market. Workers have had enough and traded up. Yet when people speak up in this country they are vilified as selfish. The truth is they use their voices because they care.

NHS strikes: Nurses and ambulance workers fear 'collapse of NHS' amid biggest day of action yet,"The public has been urged to use hospitals and emergency services ""wisely"", as NHS Providers – which represents trusts - warned the whole service was approaching a “crunch point”Exhausted nurses fear they are witnessing the demise of the NHS as anger grows at the Government’s failure to tackle the crisis. Despite the biggest ever NHS strike, Health Secretary Steve Barclay played down the scale of industrial action on the first day nurses and ambulance staff walked out at the same time. Talking at a picket line, A&E nurse Mark Boothroyd, 37, told the Mirror: “It feels like we are seeing the collapse of the NHS and the nursing profession. “I’ve been nursing for 10 years and every year conditions have worsened. “Inflation has driven pay down 20%. More and more nurses are leaving the profession. It’s at breaking point.”   A colleague speaking outside St Thomas’ Hospital in South London, Ben Trenwith, 31, said: “We want the respect our profession deserves.” A&E sister Jessica Turnbull, 31, said every shift ends with “someone in tears” and “there’s assaults daily”. Community matron Kafeelat Adekunle, 57, said: “Nurses going to foodbanks and borrowing money from relatives… that is unacceptable. It’s so wrong.” The Royal College of Nursing started its first 48-hour strike – involving 30,000 nurses – as 11,500 ambulance workers walked out too.  The RCN, paramedics’ union GMB and the Royal College of Midwives have put strikes in Wales on hold to consider an improved 7.5% pay rise by the Welsh government. But Mr Barclay has refused to reopen the issue of the 4.5% pay settlement for England. Jane Matthews, 66, a nurse at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, said her pay has risen less than £1.50 a week in seven years.   On the picket line outside Bristol Royal Infirmary, she added she has been working 12-hour shifts with no breaks on wards that are only 40% staffed. She said: “I find it a challenge to come into work any more.” Action was also taken at sites such as the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton. Saffron Cordery, chief of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, urged ministers to negotiate a pay settlement.   She added ambulance staff and nurses striking at the same time “will have a knock-on effect on patients”. The RCN escalated its campaign with strikes at 73 NHS trusts in England. Its chief Pat Cullen said: “This Government has chosen to punish the nurses of England instead of getting round a table and talking to me about pay.   ""Rishi Sunak can choose to have talks over strikes.”  Nurses and ambulance workers went on strike at around half the trusts in England and Northern Ireland.  Mr Barclay said: “The majority of trusts are not on strike. This is a minority of trusts where strike action is being taken.”  Nurses will walk out again today amid an unprecedented week of NHS strikes. The Tories want staff to focus on pay for next year. Mr Barclay said: “We should be looking forward to the pay review body that is taking evidence now and working constructively with the unions.”   Sharon Graham, of the Unite union, said the Tories “can’t always sing ‘la la la la la’ and hope the year goes by and we’ll forget what’s happened”. Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting slammed the Tories for failing to negotiate. He said: “It looks like the Prime Minister and the Health Secretary are the ones on strike.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nhs-strikes-live-ambulance-workers-29142069
'The Tory end times should be more fun than this',"The government's remaining lifespan can be counted in days but no-one seems to have realised, says Fleet Street Fox. We're due a 1997-style boost of joy, but can Keir Starmer deliver it?Very few people who have wondered what the end times would look like would have guessed that certain doom would be presided over by a zombie, a Thunderbird puppet, and a relentlessly-happy Scrooge and Marley. And yet - welcome to the last year of Tory rule, starring an undead Liz Truss, a barely-human Matt Hancock, and topped off with a Chancellor and Prime Minister whose eternal souls will still be giggling joyfully as the worst demons Satan can find eat them from the toes up. There are less than 1,000 days before Rishi Sunak has to call an election which he is as likely to win as he is to eat anything from Greggs, yet no-one seems very happy about it. Is it all Keir Starmer's fault?  Recent polls show that even Tory voters want rid of the Tories. All the other voters certainly do. The extreme likelihood of the entire Tory party being reduced to two backbenchers in Lincolnshire should, therefore, make all voters happy. The political self-immolation of Liz Truss burned her premiership to the ground and spaffed £50billion up the wall. She should be moving on to a lucrative career in global finance, yet keeps popping up in political life, unaware the nation's concerned stakeholders all want to bury it in wherever her heart ought to be. Defective man-puppet Matt Hancock abandoned all pretence of being an MP to enter the jungle, where he barely mentioned any topics beyond ""the real me"", like a first attempt at Pinocchio who missed out on the magic fairy dust by *this* much. Now he's stuck in a GMB maze, trying to find Richard Madeley while wearing the blankly optimistic expression of a Labrador that's been dropped on its head.   And then to Dominic Raab, a man with two law degrees and no self-awareness; Nadine Dorries, a woman so desperate for love she'll accept a job on Talk TV if it means an excuse to get Boris Johnson on the sofa; and Jacob Rees-Mogg, the result of an Addams Family alternate universe where Lurch went to Eton and turned everyone he met into sausages. This should all be genuinely hilarious. And from an objective distance - like, Saturn's furthermost moon - no doubt it is so funny there are little green men eating space popcorn and arguing about who should get the BAFTA. The trouble is that we're up close to it. And it hurts.   It's our NHS that's having the biggest walkout in English history. It's our buses having the funding withdrawn. It's our kids without a hot dinner, our schools letting the rain in, our dentist that's disappeared, and our shopping, heating and power bills that we'd need to be a lottery winner to fully satisfy. It's our country that's torn itself away from its nearest neighbours, with no benefits produced. It's our national discourse that's been poisoned by the things that get people angry, like immigrants and benefits and Jeremy Corbyn. It's our rapes that go unreported, our police who are corrupted, our jobs that get reassessed. It was the same at the beginning, in 2010. Nothing's really changed, except the rot has become impossible to ignore. Then, and now, they did not rely on the NHS, take the bus, go to state schools, count the pennies. They were always globally connected, banking in Panama and paying tax in Gibraltar. They don't get raped. They aren't disabled. They weren't born with the landlord's mould in their mouth.    But even considering the unrelenting misery of so many millions of people's existence - from the pandemic to long-term illness and increased disabilities, to industrial action and redundancies, to businesses going bust and roads getting potholed - we should, at least, be happy that there's not much more of it. Even Tory MPs, who should be getting geared up to make millions with no scrutiny on the highly-remunerated seas of executive directorships, aren't finding new opportunities. They seem to want to stay in charge, unable to find solutions to anything, but for some reason determined to keep displaying their utter unfitness for any sort of office, including the ones in abandoned lorry containers in scrapyards.  Sajid Javid announced he was stepping down, then started spouting off on NHS reform. Boris Johnson was all but bankrupted by his morally-bankrupt time in office, but he keeps acting like he wants to return. GO AWAY, THE PAIR OF YOU. Why the gloom? Because there is no dawn. Just relentless, endless nightmare. Keir Starmer is not being positive and upbeat, Labour is not shouting about its big ideas, and no-one has any reason to think that once the Tories are defenestrated we'll have anything but a broken window to look at.    That will change. Labour's policy committees are drafting the manifesto promises and - considering the uncosted nightmare of Trussonomics - it's only right they do the sums a couple of times first. The frontbench are just warming up, getting ready for the sprint to the finish. Rachel Reeves is doing some lunges, David Lammy is following a wall pilates video off TikTok, Angela Rayner is filing her teeth into points. And somewhere, let us hope, over the course of the next year Keir Starmer will be getting a spray tan, his hair will be de-slicked, and someone's will tart up his ties. Yes, we're all ready for a bit of boring competence, but Tony Blair didn't win a landslide by telling everyone he used to be a lawyer. He got it with style and splash when up against a dead duck, and if Starmer's to do the same he has to start treating Rishi Sunak as though he wants to see him slathered in hoi sin sauce and wrapped in a pancake. These are gloomy end times, but we'd all be a lot perkier about it if we thought the sun was about to break out. If Starmer doesn't up his game in the next year, this is how the Tories will end - not with a bang, but a simper. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tory-end-times-more-fun-29145661
Tory MP's housekeeper says she was treated like a SLAVE and took legal action to get paid,"Hazel Settas has opened up about her treatment while employed by ex-justice minister Jonathan Djanogly and his wife Rebecca, who she said told her she was 'worthless'A Tory MP’s housekeeper today says she was treated like a slave, suffered insults, was reduced to tears and had to take legal action against the politician’s wife to get paid.   Hazel Settas was given rigid instructions on answering the phone within four rings, how long to run the tap – and even how to arrange avocados in the fruit bowl.   She says she “worked like a dog” for ex-justice minister Jonathan Djanogly and wife Rebecca.   The live-in housekeeper was on duty from 7am to 7pm – but sometimes worked to 11pm.   But Hazel, 32, claims Mr Djanogly, 57 – MP for Huntingdon, Cambs, from a family worth £300million – looked down on her as “not even a human”. And his wife, claims Hazel, allegedly said: “My husband’s an MP, you’re worthless.”    Hazel is one of two women who successfully took Mrs Djanogly – under her maiden name of Silk – to court for pay due to them.  The second woman even sought help from the Salvation Army’s modern slavery unit.   A judge concluded pay had been withheld in both cases. The women worked at the MP’s £7million West London home after answering Gumtree ads for a £20,000-a-year housekeeper.   Hazel, who was employed in 2020, told the Sunday Mirror: “It was slavery... especially when she used to click her fingers, that’s slavery right there... I’ve got a name, use my name.   “I did feel angry, devastated actually. I applied for a role that turned out to be something else.   “I just had to bow down to anything she said. I couldn’t speak up. The easiest way to describe it is how you think a slave would work.”   Hazel says she once told Rebecca: “You can’t treat people like this. This is worse than a slave, this is worse than prison.”  She said she also asked the MP for her help, but none was forthcoming.   Hazel was given a folder detailing her tasks. She went on: “I worked sometimes to 10 or 11 at night to complete all tasks because I would be told off if I didn’t complete them. There were pages and pages of tasks. I felt like I was working in a prison. I would break down in my room.”   Of going unpaid, Hazel said: “I was shocked she would behave like that when her husband was an MP. That was why I asked him to help me but he didn’t. And that was why I had to take her to court to get the money I was owed.   “You don’t expect an MP to have that treatment going on in his house.”  Hazel said the MP’s wife would shout “hurry up, hurry up” at her. She also claimed Ms Silk told her: “If you lose weight, you’ll be quicker.... this is my house, this is my rules, if you don’t like it you know where the door is.”  Hazel – who quit after a fortnight – continued: “One time when I got something wrong she made me pull out the folder. She made me sit there and read out the whole folder out loud and I was crying and she went, ‘stop crying, grow up and carry on reading’.”   The housekeeper also said of Mr Djanogly: “He’s looking down at me as in, you know, I’m a housekeeper, that’s it, I’m nothing else. Not even a human, I’m just a housekeeper.”   Hazel said she wrote to the MP to chase unpaid wages.   Mr Djanogly – who once went on the record with concerns about modern day slavery – replied by email: “Sorry to see that things did not work out for you. I am neither the employing person nor do I have knowledge of the issues you discuss in your message. The employer is Ms Rebecca Silk.” Hazel spoke out after judgments concluded she and the other housekeeper had been denied earnings.   A judge ordered Hazel be paid £886. Hazel said she was first offered a £150 settlement by Ms Silk via the ACAS service.   But she rejected the deal, which came with a confidentiality clause.  In the case of the second housekeeper, a written judgment declared Ms Silk, 56, “sought to deprive” her “of important rights available to workers and employees”.    The woman, who we are not naming, worked in an identical role as housekeeper in the spring and summer of 2021. After the judgment last June, she was awarded £3,148 in unauthorised wage deductions, overtime and annual leave. Ms Silk had denied unlawful deductions and any holiday pay shortfall.   The judgment said the housekeeper had to follow detailed orders.   These dictated “the rotation of avocados between the fruit bowl and the fridge”, “counting cutlery”, “how to carry items from the coffee table to the sink”, and “how to clean stools”, it was said.   Instructions for how to do laundry ran to a page-and-a-half, including “setting alarms and sending texts about collection of dirty clothes”.   The woman was described as “an impressive witness” by the judge. After leaving her job at the Djanogly home she sought help from the modern slavery support unit at the Salvation Army. She quit her job after being off sick for four days and was offered emergency accommodation by the charity.     Case paperwork says the woman had only £80 to her name when she took the job at the Djanogly home. In her case, the judgment says that “unknown to the claimant, the respondent was monitoring her work on CCTV”.   The housekeeper was required to be home at 11pm on any night before she had work the next day. It was also understood that she would be within 15 minutes’ walk of the Djanogly home at other times.   The judge said: “The whole picture is of the respondent retaining a very substantial degree of control over the claimant.”   The judge concluded there were £2,203 of unauthorised deductions, plus £481 of holiday pay and £463 breach of contract overtime due.   Mr Djanogly – son of textiles tycoon and art collector Sir Harry Djanogly – did not respond to a request for comment and yesterday there was no answer at his home in West London.   The Conservative Party declined to comment.  The avocado's...and don'ts Dickensian working conditions imposed at MP Jonathan Djanogly’s home are outlined in written instructions revealed by Hazel.   Orders running to more than 100 words addressed the ripeness of avocados. They said: “Check the avocados in the bowl & put any that are slightly soft into the fridge.   “Check to see if there are 8 soft avocados in the fridge... if not add up the missing number of soft avocados and put this number of hard avocados into the fruit bowl.    “So if there are 2 soft avocados in the fridge put 6 hard into the bowl. Or if there are no soft avocados in the fridge put 8 into the bowl. If we have less than 8 avocados in total put on shopping list. Now review soft avocados – If there are any that you... will not eat today and that are unlikely to last till tomorrow then let RD [Rebecca Djanogly] know by WA [WhatsApp].” Housekeepers also had a “morning priority items” list instructing: “PLEASE DO TASKS IN ORDER SHOWN.”   The housekeeper was instructed to clean the bottom of her shoes “with kitchen roll if there are solids... but just a damp blue cloth if no solids and dry the bottom with a dry cloth”.   Of hand-washing, the order read: “Don’t turn on the tap till you have finished cleaning hands with the liquid soap.” Another note said: “The idea of the chart is so you know if I’m happy. If the chart is done then I’m happy. It’s [sic] a big house and you cant [sic] remember everything so please stick with the chart and take it round with you... don’t tick before you’ve completed line on the chart. Let me repeat… don’t tick before you’ve completed the line on the chart.”  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tory-mps-housekeeper-says-treated-29135306

Paul and Emma know from their son’s heart transplant experience that dedicated nurses and other staff go the extra mile for patients and deserve better treatment from the Tories. As the NHS braces itself for another week of walkouts, the Prime Minister should open his eyes and ears instead of digging in his heels. The public is with NHS workers and know Conservatives are the villains in this crisis. People are blaming Rishi Sunak, Jeremy Hunt, Stephen Barclay, Grant Shapps and the rest of a Government out of touch. For the sake of the country’s health and prosperity, we urge the Tories to negotiate with workers who have legitimate grievances. We’re all on the side of the NHS.   Time to quit Dud Liz Truss is making a fool of herself yet again by trying to rewrite history. The former Prime Minister presenting herself as a wronged leader might be laughable if families and businesses weren’t paying the price of her disastrous, brief reign in No 10. The Tory Party members and MPs who put her there must share responsibility. However Truss owes the country a personal apology for the mayhem she unleashed. Sorry seems to be the hardest word for her. Yet the wool will not be pulled over the eyes of all of us who endured her weeks in charge. The fact we have not yet had an apology from her is typical of an ideological extremist. Truss should do the decent thing and quit as an MP.

Shameless Liz Truss blames Tories for not being right-wing enough after economic failure,"Truss, who has now been an ex-PM over twice as long as the 49 days she was in the top job, moaned about her party’s failure to back her catastrophic mini-Budget plans for £47billion of unfunded tax cuts.Shameless Liz Truss has tried to blame the economic meltdown she unleashed during her disastrous days at No10 on what she claims is the left-wing economic establishment. As families continue to struggle with rising interest rates and soaring inflation, the failed former Prime Minister said the problem lay not with her policies but with fellow Tories not being right-wing enough. Truss, who has now been an ex-PM over twice as long as the 49 days she was in the top job, moaned about her party’s failure to back her catastrophic mini-Budget plans for £47billion of unfunded tax cuts. In a 4,000-word gripe in The Sunday Telegraph she complained of “pushing water uphill” in her bid to implement the giveaway to the wealthy.  She wrote: “Large parts of the media and the wider public sphere had become unfamiliar with key arguments about tax and economic policy and over time sentiment had shifted left-wards.    ""This is partly because we Conservatives had failed to make these arguments enough since 2010 – instead triangulating with Labour policy.”   She also suggested the economic shockwaves were not caused by her Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng ’s October mini-Budget, but that her Government merely “became a useful scapegoat” for the chaos.   She added: “I am not claiming to be blameless in what happened, but fundamentally I was not given a realistic chance to enact my policies by a very powerful economic  establishment, coupled with a lack of political support.”   Scottish Greens economic spokeswoman Maggie Chapman yesterday hit back at the “attempt to rewrite history”. She said: “ Liz Truss wasn’t brought down by any supposedly left-wing economic establishment, she was brought down by her own recklessness and economic mismanagement.”  Shadow Health Minister Liz Kendall said: “Liz Truss is back with no apology and no humility.” Tory MP Richard Graham said it was “probably a mistake” to claim Truss “had the right ideas”. A Conservative source said Truss was “more deranged than we realised” and “the worst PM in UK history”. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/shameless-liz-truss-blames-tories-29140631
Boris Johnson's 40 hospitals promise falls flat as only quarter have planning permission,"The pledge was a key plank of Boris Johnson's 2019 general election manifesto - and Rishi Sunak will be banking on progress ahead of an electionBoris Johnson's promise to build 40 new hospitals is falling flat, with just a quarter having been granted planning permission.  More than three years after making the commitment to build the new hospitals by 2030 - just ten have received permission to build work.   The pledge was a key plank of Mr Johnson's 2019 general election manifesto.   And failure to make progress would be hugely damaging for an already struggling Rishi Sunak as he prepares for an election in the next 18 months.   The Liberal Democrats said details obtained through parliamentary questions and Freedom of Information requests showed the programme was behind schedule and the target was almost certain to be missed.  The party said some projects had not even received outline planning permission. Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the failure meant communities would be left to struggle on with with crumbling facilities that were badly in need of updating.    ""This is truly scandalous. The Conservative Government is on course to break their flagship NHS promise and refuse to admit it,"" she said.  ""Communities already suffering from dangerously long ambulance waiting times are also left with crumbling hospitals which are falling apart at the seams. ""Time and time again Conservative health ministers are hiding the truth from the country. Their big promises have been shown to not be worth the paper they are written on.""  The Department of Health and Social Care said that it was working with the NHS trusts concerned to ensure an early start to building where possible. It said the programme groups the different schemes into ""cohorts"" based on an assessment of their readiness and the extent to which they can benefit from the advantages of delivery through a national programme. A spokesman said: ""We are investing £3.7 billion for the first four years of the New Hospital Programme and remain committed to all schemes that have been announced as part of it. ""Requirements for planning permission are dependent on construction timelines over the decade and we continue to work closely with trusts on their plans. ""We are developing a national approach to constructing new hospitals so schemes can be built more rapidly and ensure value for money.""

Next phase for cow vaccine trial fuels hopes of an end to the badger cull,"Campaigners hoped the announcement of another step towards a bovine tuberculosis jab for cattle could speed-up the end of the badger-killing scheme in English countiesThe end of the badger cull moved a step closer today as officials announced the next step in a bovine TV jab for cows. Some 174,517 badgers have been killed since 2013 under efforts to curb the spread of tuberculosis in cattle. Cull supporters blame the animals for fuelling the spread of TB across the countryside, with more than 38,000 cattle slaughtered in England and Wales in 2021 to tackle the disease, which costs taxpayers about £100million a year. Campaigners have pinned their hopes on a vaccine which could protect cattle - and pave the way for the end of the badger killing programme. The Mirror told in November how up to 67,801 badgers could be killed over the autumn and winter across 21 counties: Gloucestershire, Somerset, Cornwall, Devon, Herefordshire, Cheshire, Wiltshire, Staffordhshire, Cumbria, Avon, Shropshire, Buckinghamshire, Northamptonshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Oxfordshire, Warwickshire, Lincolnshire, Hampshire, Berkshire and Worcestershire.

  But in the latest stage of developing a vaccine, the Animal and Plant Health Agency said field trials for a cattle inoculation and new skin test for bTB have moved to the next phase. The Government said: “If the second phase is successful, we will be closer to being able to vaccinate cattle against this endemic disease.” Badger Trust chief executive Peter Hambly said it “welcomes the news that improved cattle skin tests and cattle vaccines are near deployment”. He added: “The answer to dealing with bTB lies in measures focused on cattle - improved biosecurity measures, including reduced cattle movements and, of course, introducing improved testing and cattle vaccines. “In contrast, it is likely that by the end of 2022, over 200,000 badgers will have been slaughtered in the ongoing English badger cull, with little evidence that this impacts bTB in cattle.  “This wildlife tragedy has to end with many setts now empty across England when the answer to dealing with bTB has always been with cattle, not badgers.” Pilot schemes for the next tests and vaccine are taking place on farms across the country and are due to finish this year(2023). Phase 2 will involve at least five farms and 600 animals participating, 300 of which will be vaccinated with the rest getting a placebo. APHA’s lead scientist for TB Dr Phil Hogarth said: “I am pleased that we have progressed to the next phase of the field trials for a cattle vaccine and DIVA (Detect Infected among Vaccinated Animals) skin test for bovine tuberculosis. “This next step represents a significant milestone, building upon many years of research, and APHA will continue to be led by science, and work tirelessly in the fight to eradicate this disease.” Wildlife campaigner Dominic Dyer, policy adviser at the Born Free Foundation, said it “welcomes the next stage of field trials for a bovine cattle vaccine and skin test, but has little confidence that this Government has any serious commitment to bring a final end to badger culling”.  He added: “Bovine TB is primarily a cattle-based disease and the only long-term solution to lowering its spread is by improved TB testing, implementing tighter biosecurity and cattle movement controls and rolling out an effective TB vaccine for cattle.” England, Scotland and Wales’s chief vets said in a statement: “Bovine TB represents one of the most difficult animal disease challenges the world faces today. “We are making substantial progress in developing an additional tool to help eradicate this disease with the new cattle vaccine and DIVA skin test - and are very grateful to the vets and farmers taking part for their efforts in making this work on the ground. “If this next phase is successful, this project takes us one step closer to a vaccine to be used in conjunction with other measures to tackle this insidious disease which impacts livestock farmers across the globe.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/next-phase-cow-vaccine-trial-29139021
Theatres under threat as Labour warns of funding crisis - list of venues most at risk,"A host of regional playhouses are deemed at risk of closure after years of cuts and as families battle the cost-of-living emergency, the party revealedLocal theatres could be forced to bring down the final curtain amid a funding crisis, Labour has warned A host of regional playhouses are deemed at risk of closure after years of cuts and as families battle the cost-of-living emergency, the party revealed. The Theatres Trust said those most at risk include Brighton Hippodrome, Hulme Hippodrome in Manchester, Dudley Hippodrome in the West Midlands, Plymouth Palace and Salford Victoria. Scroll down for the Theatre Trust's list of the venues most at risk of closure Shadow Arts Minister Barbara Keeley will use a speech at the Trust on Monday to highlight the threat posed to much-loved community treasures. She is due to say: “Labour has always recognised the value of theatres in acting as vibrant cultural and community hubs. “Local theatres provide jobs, boost local businesses and offer world-class performances that can delight, stimulate and inspire.  “But the cost-of-living crisis means it could be the final curtain for some, with theatres under threat like never before. “A decade of Conservative Government failure makes a farce of levelling-up, with areas like the Midlands and the North West hit the hardest.”   Labour described theatres “as an essential feature of our high streets and a leading force in both our cultural identity and the UK’s international standing as a world-leader in the arts”, employing 290,000 workers. But analysis from the House of Commons Library shows real terms spending by town halls on theatres and public entertainment fell by 35% between 2010/11 and 2021/22.  The areas with biggest reductions in council funding over the 11 years were the South West, East Midlands, North West and West Midlands. Just £136.5million was spent last year, compared with £209m a decade earlier, according to inflation-adjusted figures. A Government spokeswoman said: ""We know this is a challenging time for theatres and we remain firmly on their side. “This is why we have supported theatres, arts venues and businesses with the £18billion Energy Bill Relief Scheme throughout the winter.  ""We are levelling-up access to the arts across the country. “Funding in theatre has increased through Arts Council England's latest investment round, with £110million going to almost 200 organisations every year.""

'Warring hat-trick of Tory calamities are a tragedy for the British people',"Kevin Macguire looks at how Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak being at loggerheads is bad news for all of us as Truss tries to blame everyone but herselfThree's a catastrophic crowd with Liz Truss and Boris Johnson believing they, not Rishi Sunak, should be Prime Minister. The warring hat-trick of Tory failures, an unholy trio of Conservative calamities, is a tragedy for a Britain enduring growing problems they helped create. From record falls in living standards and an economy forecast to do worse than sanctioned Russia this year to an NHS on its knees and the wave of strikes, shouting “Covid” and “Putin” are fast becoming rejected Tory excuses. And fatally weak Sunak’s unable to silence a pair of noisy predecessors during what feels the last days of a collapsing regime after 13 years in office. Deranged Truss ludicrously blaming everybody except herself for pulling the plug on an economy on life support should have doctors in flapping white coats carting her away. Liar Johnson stalking Sunak, plotting a comeback to the cheers of the Tory’s most deranged MPs, deserves to be handcuffed to a prison guard.   Sulking Sunak’s inability to shake off this pair reveals his lethal feebleness, a deadly impotence. Take teetering Dominic Raab, a Justice Secretary facing multiple bullying charges. Sunak isn’t strong enough to sack him after dawdling on tax fined Nadhim Zahawi The Keir Starmer punch he isn’t up to a big job hit Sunak hard, as the truth often does. The Tory squabbling troika of Me-Me-Mes are in it for themselves In Japan the three wise monkeys see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. Here the three Tories spot no solutions, never listen to working people and spout only nonsense. The crowd talking to themselves have never sounded or looked more isolated from the country.  MP shouldn't still be fighting for pump-action gun ban The UK gun lobby isn’t as strong as in the US, mercifully, but Luke Pollard’s struggle shows it still has clout. The Plymouth MP shouldn’t still be fighting to ban the keeping of pump-action shotguns in homes 18 months after women-hating extremist Jake Davison murdered five people in the Devon city. If the Tories won’t protect lives, outlawing these weapons in our communities could make a line in Labour’s manifesto. Rattled Sunak weighing up joining Putin and Belarus Joining Putin’s Russia and puppet Belarus as a third country outside the European Convention on Human Rights is a dangerous if shallow threat by rattled Sunak. Dangerous when joining a couple of dictatorships by quitting a body Churchill helped establish after the horrors of the Second World War would trash Britain’s global reputation. And shallow because enough saner Tory MPs would sink the odious plan, whatever frustrations they share over Channel crossings.

Changing how pharmacies work could free up 42 million GP appointments a year,"The Company Chemists’ Association said the sector could “significantly increase access to primary care”, cut annual hospital readmissions by 65,000 and deliver 10m extra routine vaccinations each year.Local pharmacies could free up more than 42 million GP appointments every year, research suggests. The Company Chemists’ Association said the sector could “significantly increase access to primary care”, cut annual hospital readmissions by 65,000 and deliver 10m extra routine vaccinations each year. The plans are revealed in the CCA’s ‘Prospectus for community pharmacy’, extracts of which have been shared exclusively with the Mirror.  The CCA said: “Community pharmacies already work collaboratively with the NHS to ensure that patients can access care easily and safely.  “Whilst the sector has evolved considerably in recent years, the CCA proposes that pharmacies could do even more to directly tackle key problems for patients. “This additional resource for the NHS can be unlocked by appropriate support and investment from policymakers.” But the CCA warned that without extra cash, more community pharmacies could close.   The Mirror is campaigning to save family chemists, but the association said it was “concerned that without immediate action closures will become increasingly common”. It added: “Fewer pharmacies will considerably diminish access to vital medicines and services, with the greatest impact on those in deprived communities. “Without immediate action and funding core services will be lost.” The CCA proposes creating a “pharmacy first” service to shift at least 30.5m urgent and same-day appointments a year from GP practices. It wants to transfer more than 10m vaccinations and at least two million contraception appointments away from GP practices every year. The body also outlined plans to screen five million people each year for undiagnosed hypertension - potentially diagnosing 200,000 new patients Chief executive Malcolm Harrison said: “The future of community pharmacy has the potential to be incredibly bright - pharmacies can help immediately improve access to GPs. “However, we are at a fork in the road. “Policymakers cannot escape the fact that the current business model for community pharmacy is broken, and that the pharmacy network is no longer economically viable. “If the Government wants to deliver a tangible difference to the healthcare of the nation, they will take forward recommendations outlined in this prospectus. “If they are not serious, the Government will be making a conscious decision to wind down the sector.”  Labour MP Taiwo Owatemi, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Pharmacy and sits on the Commons Health Select Committee, said: “Pharmacies are at the bedrock of our communities with nine out of 10 of us living within a 20-minute walk of one and yet they remain limited to giving advice and providing over-the-counter purchase of medicines.  “If the Government is serious about tackling the crisis across the NHS, it needs to take advantage of the sleeping giant that is community pharmacy. “If properly funded, we could expect pharmacies to release over 42 million appointments from GP surgeries and reduce hospital readmissions by 65,000 a year. “Pharmacies are closing at an alarming rate. “It is high time the Government took notice of this underutilised sector and put its money where its mouth is.” A Department of Health spokesman said: “Community pharmacies play a vital role in our healthcare system and we back them with £2.6billion a year and an additional £100m to help support services. “Over the next 18 months we will be increasing the support pharmacists - who are degree qualified medical health professionals - can provide including taking referrals from A&E, managing oral contraception needs and supporting patients who have been newly-prescribed antidepressants. “Eighty percent of people can access a pharmacy within a 20-minute walk and there remain twice as many pharmacies in deprived areas compared to less deprived areas.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/changing-how-pharmacies-work-could-29138523
Fears over Brexit 'backdoor' for trophy hunters to bring home sick souvenirs,"Campaigners have moved to ease fears a forthcoming ban on imports of animal skins, severed heads and carcasses could have a 'loophole' created by the Northern Ireland protocolCampaigners have moved to ease fears British trophy hunters could use Northern Ireland as a “backdoor” to bring home their sick souvenirs. Legislation which will block hunters importing bringing animal skins, severed heads and carcasses back to Britain after shoots abroad is going through Parliament. The Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill, led by backbencher Henry Smith, is due back in the Commons on March 17. It is expected to be supported by ministers, paving the way for it to become law. But Democratic Unionist Party MP Sammy Wilson, who backs the ban and helped scrutinise the Bill, fears the ongoing dispute over the Northern Ireland Protocol - the post-Brexit system designed at preventing a hard border along the 310-mile frontier between the province and the Republic - could allow hunters to bring trophies into Britain.   Mr Wilson, whose party opposes the controversial mechanism that effectively draws a trade border down the Irish Sea, said: “The legislation could only apply to Great Britain and not to Northern Ireland because of the Northern Ireland Protocol. “I have raised concerns that Northern Ireland could become the avenue through which trophy hunters could smuggle their trophies into the rest of the United Kingdom and called upon the Minister to address this issue. “Only by addressing the issues of the Protocol can this loophole be closed. “It is another reminder of how the Protocol does not only affect Northern Ireland but affects the Government’s ability to pass laws which are effective in the whole of the United Kingdom.”  But Eduardo Goncalves, founder of the Mirror-backed Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting, said: ""The Government can stop Northern Ireland's trophy hunters from being exempted with a stroke of a pen. “The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland can issue a ministerial decree saying permits to import hunting trophies will no longer be issued. ""Opinion polls clearly show that people in Northern Ireland are as appalled by this disgusting trade as everyone else in the UK, and the Bill enjoys the support of all of Northern Ireland's Westminster MPs. “It would therefore be outrageous if trophy hunters in Northern Ireland were still allowed to get away with murder.""

"Delete TikTok from your phones to keep your data safe from hackers, says MP","Tory Alicia Kearns, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, suggested the video-sharing platform is linked to China’s efforts to build a “tech totalitarian state”People should delete TikTok from their phones to keep personal data safe from hostile threats, a senior MP has said.  Tory Alicia Kearns, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, suggested the video-sharing platform is linked to China’s efforts to build a “tech totalitarian state”.  There have been concerns around TikTok’s links to China because its parent company is Chinese and critics fear data could be passed to the state.  Last year, TikTok executive Liz Kanter insisted the platform has not been asked for UK user data by the Chinese government and would not provide it if it was.  But speaking after the US shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon, Ms Kearns told Sky’s Sophy Ridge: “We are being naive.    “We’ve now seen that people working in China for TikTok hacked into European data so it could track down the source of a journalist. “TikTok gives away the data that makes you most vulnerable.  “There’s a reason why China has this app. There’s a reason why they’re buying up gay dating apps.”  She warned: “Everyone should be concerned."" A TikTok spokesperson said: “TikTok is enjoyed by millions of people across the UK, and we want to be clear that they can trust us with their data. We're taking steps like storing UK user data in our data centre operations in Ireland, starting this year; further reducing employee access to data; and minimising data flows outside of Europe.  “We have written to Ms. Kearns on a number of occasions to ensure she has all the facts and information available and we look forward to having constructive engagement with her on these important issues in the near future.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/delete-tiktok-your-phones-keep-29139595
Liz Truss blames others for her failure as PM - FULL LIST OF WHO,"The disaster-prone ex-PM complained she was never given a ""realistic chance"" to implement her wild, uncosted tax-cutting rampage because a ""powerful economic establishment"" got in the wayLiz Truss has decided, after months of painful soul searching, that 'the establishment' were to blame for her disastrous 49-day failure in Number 10. The former PM has been more visible around Westminster in recent days, with friends claiming she believes she has ""half a hope"" of leading her party again in opposition. In a 4,000 word epic, published in the Telegraph, the former Prime Minister accepted she was not ""blameless"" for nearly crashing the economy, sending hundreds of thousands of Brits spiralling into poverty. In the end, her premiership was outlasted by an iceberg lettuce. But she complained she was never given a ""realistic chance"" to implement her wild, uncosted tax-cutting rampage because a ""powerful economic establishment"" got in the way. She also blamed, among others:  Her own party The markets The public and media not understanding ""key arguments"" about tax The public being too left-wing Joe Biden Treasury pessimism The Pensions Regulator The Bank Of England Uncertainty in the bond markets Nobody telling her about liability-driven investments The government communications system ""The blob of vested interests""  Later this month she’ll address a conference of international politicians in Japan, with a “hawkish” speech on China - which many have seen as part of a plan to rehabilitate herself and kickstart a return to frontline politics.   A Tory source said: ""She’s more deranged than we realised. ""This is the woman who almost caused a run on the pound and is now pretending she has some answer to our problems. She should stick to the after dinner speaker circuit, cashing in on why she was the worst prime minister in uk history’ Ms Truss accepted she was ""not the slickest communicator"", and that she had ""underestimated the resistance"" that slashing taxes for the wealthy - something she dismissed as a ""rounding error"" would prompt.  And she mused on whether it she should not have jetted off to New York to attend the UN General Assembly after the Queen's funeral, ""and instead supervised the final preparation of our announcements more closely."" But for the most part, Ms Truss remains convinced her plan was right all along, and the ""establishment"" just weren't ready for it. And she claimed her government had been made a ""scapegoat"" for problems that had been brewing for some time.  ""I assumed upon entering Downing Street that my mandate would be respected and accepted. How wrong I was. While I anticipated resistance to my programme from the system, I underestimated the extent of it,"" she wrote. ""Similarly, I underestimated the resistance inside the Conservative parliamentary party to move to a lower-tax, less-regulated economy."" Ms Truss's brief premiership lasted just 49 days as she was forced to quit after Mr Kwarteng's £45 billion package of unfunded tax cuts panicked the markets and tanked the pound.  Ms Truss said that while her experience last autumn was ""bruising for me personally"", she believed that over the medium term her policies would have increased growth and therefore brought down debt. But she said she had not been warned of the risks to the bond markets from liability-driven investments (LDIs) - bought up by pension funds - which forced the Bank of England to step in to prevent them collapsing as the cost of government borrowing soared.  Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: ""The Conservatives crashed the economy, sank the pound, put pensions in peril and made working people pay the price through higher mortgages for years to come.   ""After 13 years of low growth, squeezed wages and higher taxes under the Tories, only Labour offers the leadership and ideas to fix our economy and to get it growing.""

Fans of the programme were stunned to see him there and being interviewed.  Angry viewers took to Twitter to vent their frustrations over Hancock's appearance, following his  I'm A Celebrity stint, where he finished third place behind show winner Jill Scott and runner up Owen Warner. Hancock even hinted at a possible appearance on the show, before admitting this would be much harder than the jungle show.

A spokesperson for Mr Hancock told the Mirror: ""As well as raising the profile of his dyslexia campaign in front of 11-million viewers, Matt's donated £10,000 to St Nicholas Hospice in Suffolk and the British Dyslexia Association, off the back of his appearance on 'I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here'.""

Andy Burnham: Desperately sad to see NHS on its knees with goodwill in balance,"Writing for The Mirror, Andy Burnham calls on the government to give nurses the pay rise they deserve and get the NHS back on track When Labour left office, NHS waiting lists were at a record low and public satisfaction at an all-time high. You could get a GP appointment within 48 hours. In A&E, the vast majority of patients – 98% – were seen within four hours. An authoritative global body, the Commonwealth Fund, judged that the NHS was the best health service in the world. Here we are 13 years on and just look at it now. The NHS has been brought to its knees and it is desperately sad to see. I am not saying Labour got everything right. The private sector was allowed to encroach too far and unacceptable care failures should have been spotted earlier. The much-needed reform of social care was left too late. All that said, it is unarguable that the last Labour Government got a huge amount right on the NHS.   Having inherited a service in a similar position to the one it’s in now, we oversaw a massive turn-around in its fortunes. Different people will have different explanations as to how this was achieved. I am 100% clear about the main reason: a crucial decision by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown in the early 2000s to invest in its most important asset – the NHS workforce. In the Tory 90s, just like the Tory 20s, NHS pay and staff shortages were big issues. Coming into Government, Labour initially stuck to Tory spending limits. It was soon clear waiting lists would not fall without (a) major investment and (b) a significant part of it being devoted to recruiting more staff and paying them fairly.  So, a new national pay framework – Agenda for Change – was duly introduced and it underpinned the improvement of the NHS in the years that followed. There’s a simple moral to this the story: the NHS will only look after us well if it looks after its own staff. This is something the Tory Party has never understood. One of the early acts of the Cameron Government was an attempt to break up Agenda for Change with a new regional system. At the time, I remember visiting Bristol and speaking to an A&E nurse about it. She said management had been around the wards asking staff to sign new contracts, replacing their 37.5-hour working week with a 41-hour week. “What did you do?”, I asked her. “I signed it”, she replied, quick as a flash. “Why?” “Because I currently do a 45-hour week but they don’t realise that. If they want to play it that way, I’ll just do 41.” This conversation has always stuck in my mind. The NHS is more than the sum of its parts because of the goodwill of its staff and what they give to it without being paid. If you lose that goodwill, you lose the NHS. Right now, it is hanging in the balance. If Rishi Sunak is to have any hope of fulfilling his waiting time promises, he needs the workforce with him. Prime Minister, pay them fairly and put our NHS back on its feet.  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/andy-burnham-desperately-sad-see-29139063
Union boss accuses Tory Grant Shapps of 'lying' about NHS ambulance strike,"Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham said the idea that Ambulance workers didn't provide minimum cover while on strike is an ""absolute, utter lie"" A union boss has accused Tory Grant Shapps of ""lying"" about striking NHS ambulance workers.   Sharon Graham, General Secretary of the Unite union, told the BBC the suggestion made by Mr Shapps this morning that ambulance workers did not provide minimum service during strike days was ""an absolute, utter lie.""  Tens of thousands of nurses and ambulance staff in England are set to walk out on Monday in what is expected to be the biggest strike in NHS history. The nurses are due to strike again on Tuesday while ambulance crews and call handlers will return to the picket lines on Friday. It came after the Business Secretary accused ambulance staff of putting lives at risk by ""refusing"" to provide information on where they are striking, creating a ""postcode lottery"" for people having heart attacks. Ms Graham said that's not true. ""I haven't used this word so much about politicians in the last 30 years, but he's actually lying,"" she told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg. ""The idea that he's saying that ambulance workers did not do minimum cover in the dispute is an absolute, utter lie. ""It's important that we rectify that this morning. That is not true.""   She went on to say Health Secretary Steve Barclay is ""not telling the truth"" in claims there is a dialogue between the government and unions over pay.  She added: ""I can tell you categorically that there has been no conversations on pay whatsoever with Rishi Sunak or Steve Barclay about this dispute, in any way shape or form.  ""They've danced around their handbag, they danced around the edges but they will not talk about pay. ""To me, that is an abdication of responsibility (as) the dispute is about pay - so how can they say they are in talks?"" Asked whether whether ""on the eve of the biggest health strike in history there is zero conversation between anyone in your union and anyone at all speaking for the Government"", Mss Graham replied: ""I can absolutely categorically tell you that."" She went on: ""I can categorically say to you we are in no talks at any level whatsoever with the Government about pay in the NHS, and that is a real abdication of responsibility. ""Why is Rishi Sunak not coming to the table? Instead of doing sort of press conferences about other things, come to the table and negotiate - roll your sleeves up and negotiate on the pay in the NHS, that is what's required.""  She suggested the current state of the NHS, with people dying ""just waiting for ambulances"", means that ""on a daily basis, this Government has put people's lives at risk"". On the need for talks, she said: ""They need to come to the table. Where is Rishi Sunak? ""This is either because this man is out of his depth and he doesn't know what he is doing or there is a much more sinister reason for why they are doing this to the NHS."" Mr Shapps claimed: ""We have seen the situation where the Royal College of Nursing very responsibly before the strikes told the NHS 'This is where we are going to be striking' and they are able to put the emergency cover in place. ""Unfortunately we have been seeing a situation with the ambulance unions where they refuse to provide that information. That leaves the Army, who are driving the back-ups here, in a very difficult position - a postcode lottery when it comes to having a heart attack or a stroke when there is a strike on. ""We cannot have that situation. That is why I am introducing laws for minimum safety levels.""  Jonathan Reynolds, Labour's Shadow Business Secretary said he jokingly tells his children to behave as they ""haven't got time to go to A&E under a Tory Government"". Asked if as a parent he worries about NHS strikes, Labour's shadow business secretary told Sky's Sophy Ridge On Sunday: ""I think any family does, anyone in the country does. ""But I've got to say I feel worried now at the state of the NHS every day. ""Sometimes we'll joke to the kids 'you've got to behave, we haven't got time to go to A&E under a Tory Government', that's the kind of thing we'll say in our house because we know the pressures it's under. ""I don't think sometimes when the Government tries to cite the pressures of days when industrial action is taking place as the worry to families that they themselves are aware of just what kind of pressure and concerns there are out there every day because of the state of public services under their watch.""  He suggested Labour in power would not be able to offer double-digit pay rises to public sector workers.  Asked if his party would give nurses a 10% pay rise, Mr Reynolds told Sky's Sophy Ridge On Sunday: ""Realistically the top opening offer we probably wouldn't be able to meet that but we would negotiate. ""And fundamentally we have a much more compelling message about those workload problems because we've got that plan to abolish the non-dom rule for the super-rich and therefore use that revenue - over £3 billion - to vastly increase the numbers of doctors, nurses, midwives in the system. ""So that would be part of the negotiation."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/union-boss-accuses-tory-grant-29137165

"Wildlife charity linked to Carrie Johnson faces probe over £50,000 interior design bill","Carrie Johnson's boss wife's Victoria Aspinall or her firm received £352,658 over a four-year period from two charities. The £50,000 from Howletts Wild Animal Trust (HWAT) was in 2021Carrie Johnson’s boss faces a new scandal after a wildlife charity paid £50,000 to his wife’s interior design firm.  Victoria Aspinall or her firm received £352,658 over a four-year period from two charities.   The £50,000 from Howletts Wild Animal Trust (HWAT) was in 2021 – the year the Charity Commission began a probe into “related party transactions”. The trust is headed by Damian Aspinall, 62, who also chairs the Aspinall Foundation (AF) – where ex-PM Boris Johnson’s wife Carrie, 34, is communications director.   AF’s affairs are also being investigated by the Charity Commission. In late 2021 it emerged it paid Victoria, 36, £150,158 for “interior design services” in 2020.   And Victoria’s firm was also paid a further £90,000 by AF in 2021.    HWAT runs Howletts and Port Lympne – sister wildlife parks in Kent. Of its £50,000 payment in 2021, accounts filed with Companies House state: “Interior design services were provided by Victoria Aspinall Limited, a company of which Mrs V Aspinall, the wife of JDA Aspinall, is a director.  “The value of these services in the year were £50,000.”   Other sums, paid by AF in 2018 and 2019, take the combined total to over £350,000.   Victoria, a former strategist for fashion house Burberry, oversees design and branding at Howletts and Port Lympne, with a focus on glamping and safari lodges.  She said in a 2021 interview: “We have built five romantic shepherd’s huts at Leopard Creek [Port Lympne] with wood burners, en suite bathrooms and kitchenettes. I wanted to inject a sense of playfulness.”  Carrie Johnson – who has two children with former PM Boris – joined AF in January 2021.    She and Boris, 58, were spotted on a family trip to Howletts, near Canterbury, last October, the month after he left Downing Street.  There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Carrie Johnson.   In its 2020 accounts, AF said fees paid to Victoria were “subject to a rigorous benchmarking exercise to ensure... value for money”.   HWAT, AF and Victoria Aspinall were approached for comment.

Tory minister admits his son is on pre-pay energy meter - because 'it's convenient',"Last night, Labour's Shadow Climate Secretary Ed Miliband branded Grant Shapps ""do-nothing"" over his response to the scandalA Tory minister has admitted his own son is on a pre-payment energy meter - and claims it is 'very convenient for him'. Grant Shapps, the business secretary, has given energy firms until Tuesday to come up with a compensation plan for customers whose homes they ""invaded"" to forcibly install pre-pay meters.  People using pre-pay meters to pay for their energy can end up paying more than customers on Direct Debit, and supply is suspended if the meter is not fed. But while he said forcing customers onto such plans was ""disgraceful"" speaking on Sky News, he said he wouldn't ban them totally because they ""work"" for some people - including his own son. ""The reason you don't want want a total ban, to give you an example is my son - 21, lives in a flat in London which he shares.""   He added: ""It's actually very convenient for them to have a pre-payment meter. There are situations where you actually want to have that kind of flexibility. ""So I don't think we should ban all pre-payment meters."" Last night, Labour's Shadow Climate Secretary Ed Miliband branded Mr Shapps ""do-nothing"" over his response to the scandal. He said: “Grant Shapps is the do-nothing Business Secretary, who has sat on his hands in the face of the scandal of forced installation of prepayment meters, and simultaneously waves through energy companies making record profits at the expense of the British people. “Thousands more families have had warrants issued for the forced installation of prepayment meters since Grant Shapps refused to act weeks ago.""   He added: “Now, even after the scandal at British Gas and the millions disconnected by the back door, he still won’t adopt Labour ’s call for a total and ongoing ban on the forced installation of prepayment meters until there is wholesale reform of a discredited, rotten and callous system.  “All the while, the Government refuses a proper windfall tax and is willing to let energy companies rake in record profits at the expense of the British people, and is about to allow a 40% rise in average household bills in April. “Only Labour can fix our broken energy system- ending the prepayment meter scandal, stopping bills going up this April with a proper windfall tax and taking the long term action we need to make Britain a clean energy superpower.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tory-minister-admits-son-pre-29136716
Inside billionaire Tory treasurer's cosy dinners to link wealthy VIPs with ministers,"The super rich were given privileged access to senior ministers at undeclared dinner parties arranged by the billionaire hired as chief Tory treasurer by Rishi Sunak Super-rich VIPs were given private access to senior ministers at cosy, undeclared dinner parties arranged by a controversial billionaire hired as chief Tory treasurer by Rishi Sunak.  And a firm used by Egyptian-born Mohamed Mansour to donate £600,000 to the Tories paid $3.85 million in additional tax following an investigation by HMRC.  Meanwhile, the firm apparently scrubbed references to its operations in Russia, after the Sunday Mirror revealed Mr Mansour had continued to make cash from the region even after the invasion of Ukraine.   The Sunday Mirror has learned monthly soirees hosted by Mr Mansour saw groups of up to 12 wealthy businessmen matched up with ministers including Mr Sunak, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, Kwasi Kwarteng and Nadhim Zahawi at his lavish Belgravia residence.  After dinner, guests could quiz ministers on whatever subjects they chose for an hour or longer.  No money was raised ""as such"" at the closed-door soirees, which took place while Boris Johnson was Prime Minister between 2018 and 2022.    But guests would later be approached by senior party figures to solicit donations to the party. A source with knowledge of the parties claims former party Chairman Ben Elliott and Lord Lister, formerly Boris Johnson's chief of staff, attended some of the events. But they were not declared by ministers on Government transparency disclosures because they were considered political events.  The Conservative Party declined to comment, and a spokesperson for Mr Mansour did not respond to a request for comment on the dinner parties.  Meanwhile, it’s claimed Mr Mansour offered to bail the Tories out of a £25 million black hole, after donors deserted the party. Donations dropped by 45% in the third quarter of 2022, according to Electoral Commission figures. And according to Bloomberg, Mr Mansour has agreed to underwrite several million pounds worth of donations in order to “keep the lights on.”  The news outlet reported Mr Zahawi was “alarmed” to find the party’s operating budget was around £5 million in the red when he took over as Chairman. Mr Mansour, who is reportedly worth £2.3 billion, has already handed almost £600,000 to the party through his UK based company, Unatrac, which has has made millions through their operations in Russia. He was made Senior Treasurer in December by Mr Sunak and former chairman Nadhim Zahawi, who was sacked last week in a row over his tax affairs. Last night, Unatrac admitted to the Sunday Mirror that they had paid $3.85 million in tax after tax officials mounted an investigation. HMRC was investigating potential ‘diverted profits’ - in which money is moved from the UK to tax havens in order to avoid tax. Unatrac said they had voluntarily been audited by the taxman, and handed over the cash in October 2020 for the period between 2014 and 2018.  The firm set aside a further $4 million after a subsequent probe was opened for the period since 2018. But Unatrac say HMRC decided not to impose Diverted Profits Tax charges, and a settlement was agreed in June last year, shortly before Mr Mansour was made Tory treasurer. A spokesperson for Unatrac said: “As happens with thousands of businesses, Unatrac was subject to a tax audit from HMRC, which the company volunteered for. These sorts of audits, for a company of our size, with different revenue streams and a global operating structure, are standard practice. “Throughout the whole process, Unatrac worked collaboratively with HMRC, which concluded last summer that DPT did not apply. The matter is closed.” Last week the Mirror revealed companies belonging to Mr Mansour's family business were still operating and making money in Putin's Russia - despite Mr Sunak urging business leaders to pull their investments from the country.  The job of Senior Treasurer for the Conservative Party is expected to involve a fundraising drive ahead of next year’s expected General Election.  And Mr Mansour is said to have pledged a further £2 million in donations himself to help swell party coffers for the campaign. Mr Mansour is a client of Hawthorn Communications, the PR firm co-owned by former Tory chairman Ben Elliot.  In March, Mr Sunak urged companies to “think very carefully” about any investments that would support Vladimir Putin ’s brutal regime in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Since the story was published, all items for sale in Russia country have been removed from Unatrac's website. And the website of the group's Russia-based arm, Mantrac Vostok, last night appeared to have been removed from the internet entirely. In response to our initial story, a spokesperson for Unatrac said: “Since the invasion of Ukraine, Mantrac Vostok (a subsidiary of the Dubai company Unatrac Holding Limited) has scaled back its operations considerably and has been focused on fulfilling long standing commitments that pre-date February 2022.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/inside-billionaire-tory-treasurers-cosy-29133057
'Former PM Theresa May will be appalled at Tory MP's slavery shame',"Two servants at Jonathan Djanogly’s £7million home slaved for 13 hours, with one forced to follow detailed orders on laying out avocado pearsIt was Theresa May who championed modern slavery laws and is rightly outraged at any attempt to breach them. It was former justice minister Jonathan Djanogly who said he wanted modern slavery at the top of the government’s agenda. So the former PM will be appalled today to read how Djanogly reacts to the unlawful treatment of staff when it’s closer to home. Two servants at Djanogly’s £7million home slaved for 13 hours, with one forced to follow detailed orders on laying out avocado pears. His wife Rebecca Silk unlawfully withheld pay from the two women. One was offered help by the Salvation Army’s modern slavery team. The Djanoglys do not just live on another planet from the one the rest of us inhabit.   The way they treated these women puts them in a different solar system. The avocados got more respect. The awful Djanoglys are rich, entitled, uncaring, and dismissive of those they consider beneath them. Sounds a lot like the modern Conservative Party. The MP may not have directly employed these women, but he lived in the house they tended and ate the avocados they ripened to his liking. He may think he’s accountable to no one. We hope the voters in his Huntingdon seat now think otherwise. Kick in ballots When the Tories are represented by the likes of Jonathan Djanogly it should be no surprise Conservative voters desert them in droves. Today we reveal 48% of 2019 Tory voters want an early General Election. At a time Rishi Sunak and his chums trail 20 points behind Labour, that would ensure a Conservative wipeout. Our survey can only mean one thing. Even Tory voters want shot of this miserable government as soon as possible.  Mr Sunak’s first 100 days have not shifted the dial for his party because ministers are out of ideas so have nothing to move it with. They have no credible answers to the concerns uppermost in people’s minds – strikes, the cost of living, NHS waiting lists and cross-Channel migration A government utterly bereft of solutions is running out of rope and the democratic solution to that is to put public approval or otherwise to the test. At the ballot box.  A stay Innside Thinking of a break at a Premier Inn? Get nicked for breaking and entering and end up in HMP Five Wells. It does just as well at no cost. Critics have already dubbed the jail a “budget hotel” and inmate Michael Thurman has given it a five-star rating. No bars on windows, free wifi and en suite showers in cells which are called rooms. Thurman’s only complaint is not much shelf space. But then you could say the same about a Premier Inn. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/former-pm-theresa-appalled-tory-29135521
Nearly half of TORIES want General Election this year to sweep Rishi Sunak out of No10,"A sensational Sunday Mirror poll today shows that 48% who declared themselves Conservative voters last time either strongly support or support going to the ballot box in 2023 That rises to 61% of all voters Nearly half of those who voted Tory in 2019 now want a General Election this year which would sweep Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives from power. A sensational Sunday Mirror poll today shows that 48% who declared themselves Conservative voters last time either strongly support or support going to the ballot box in 2023 That rises to 61% of all voters. And four in ten onetime Tories say the sooner the better joining 52% of voters overall who favour an election in the next six weeks.  An exclusive Redfield and Wilton Strategies survey shows that four in ten voters would prefer to see Keir Starmer as PM with fewer than a third opting for Mr Sunak.   Only 27% would like to see Boris Johnson make a comeback and replace Mr Sunak.   As other polls consistently show the Tories lagging more than 20 points behind Labour Sir Keir would be a shoe-in for No10 if a vote was held now.     And shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves is four points ahead of the Treasury’s Jeremy Hunt when it comes to who voters want to see run the economy.   Nearly half of those questioned say Mr Sunak has failed to uphold his pledge of “integrity, professionalism and accountability” following his sacking of Tory chairman Nadhim Zahawi last week. And that included more than one in three Tories.  But six in ten approve of the PM’s plan to introduce minimum service levels to thwart strikes although 47% say workers who refuse to cross picket lines to keep services running should not be sacked. Only 29% reckon they should.   When it comes to funding the NHS four in ten oppose tax rises while more than three in five would be against those who can afford it paying £9.35 to see a GP - the cost of a prescription.   But the nation is divided over whether Prince Harry and Meghan should be invited to the King’s coronation in May with 44% saying they should come and 41% they should be excluded.

'Striking firefighters and ambulance workers get blamed for the mess Tories got us in',"This Government has tried so hard to contribute to the economy, jokes Mark Steel. Nadhim Zahawi went as far as having to pay a £1million penalty when he got caught not paying his taxAll these people on strike must accept that, because the economy has gone haywire, those who caused the problem have to cut back a bit. For example, a few weeks ago the pound crashed after a crazy budget so we had to find 50 billion quid to save it. Who caused that? Firefighters, that’s who. They made it collapse by spending all the country’s money on solid gold ladders and insisting they could only hose down burning buildings with Prosecco. Then postal workers insisted all their sacks were made by Gucci. Liz Truss begged them to stop, but they wouldn’t listen so it’s only fair they should take a pay cut. Before that we lost £20billion on a test and trace system that didn’t work, and it’s obvious who was to blame for that – ambulance drivers. The system was in a lovely package in pretty wrapping paper with bunny rabbits on it. But ambulance drivers mistook it for a man who’d had a heart attack. So they shoved it in the ambulance and the paramedics gave it CPR, pressing it so hard they snapped all the wiring.   So it’s only right they should have their pay cut so they can no longer enjoy luxuries such as somewhere to live. Tory peer Michelle Mone received £29million from the Government, after lobbying for a contract for her husband’s company which then made a pile of useless equipment. It was train drivers who made her do that. She asked the driver of the 7.53 from Manchester to Leeds if he’d divert the train to the Cayman Islands, so she could visit some of her hedge funds. But he stubbornly refused so she had to buy a personal yacht and that’s why she needed the extra cash. Teachers are the greediest of all. Instead of demanding more money, they should learn to live within their means, like the man who ran the country until recently. Then instead of wearing out their schools’ classrooms, they would spend two-thirds of their time on holiday, saving the country money.  And we could fund education in a way that’s far more reliable than the current method. Instead of relying on taxes, we find a teacher who knows a lord or the head of the BBC so they can ask them to loan out a couple of pens and a roll of toilet paper. This Government has tried so hard to contribute to the economy. Nadhim Zahawi went as far as having to pay a £1million penalty when he got caught not paying his tax. If everyone else was as selfless as this, and fiddled their finances that much they had to pay all that back, the economy would be back on its feet in a fortnight. Instead of going on strike, the nurses could all get fiddling so they have to pay a fine like Nadhim.  But that’s the trouble, it’s just ‘me me me’ with some people, isn’t it?

Energy firms given days to plan compensation for customers whose homes they broke into,"Furious Grant Shapps has also told watchdog Ofgem to get its act together after failing to haul British Gas over the coals for their appalling actionsGrant Shapps has given energy firms until Tuesday to come up with a plan to compensate customers whose homes they broke into. The furious Business Secretary has also told watchdog Ofgem to get its act together after failing to haul British Gas over the coals for their appalling actions. Companies now face making huge payouts for wrongfully installing prepayment meters in the homes of vulnerable customers. British Gas has said sorry for monstering those with small children or medical conditions by sending debt collectors to break into homes to install prepayment meters. But it admitted that of 1.5 million customers on the meters it had executed around 20,000 warrants to forcibly install them.  Mr Shapps said: “I am appalled that vulnerable customers struggling with their energy bills have had their homes invaded and prepayment meters installed.  “There is a clear duty on suppliers to provide them with support. They need to refocus their efforts on the public who are at the receiving end of this abhorrent behaviour.“ Speaking on Sky News this morning, Mr Shapps said: ""I want to make sure that this does not occur in Britain in modern Britain today, it's absolutely disgraceful no one should have the home invaded like that.""   And he said the regulator must now set up a new customer hotline for households to pass on stories of how they are being treated. Mr Shapps added: “The regulator is too easily having the wool pulled over their eyes by taking at face value what energy companies tell them. “They need to listen to customers to make sure this treatment of vulnerable consumers doesn’t happen again.” Last week some suppliers announced they would suspend forced installations. Now Mr Shapps has told them to share the number of warrants they’ve applied for in recent months and plans to publish the findings.  Ed Miliband, Labour’s Shadow Climate Secretary, said: “Grant Shapps is the do-nothing Business Secretary, who has sat on his hands in the face of the scandal of forced installation of prepayment meters, and simultaneously waves through energy companies making record profits at the expense of the British people. “Thousands more families have had warrants issued for the forced installation of prepayment meters since Grant Shapps refused to act weeks ago. “Now, even after the scandal at British Gas and the millions disconnected by the back door, he still won’t adopt Labour’s call for a total and ongoing ban on the forced installation of prepayment meters until there is wholesale reform of a discredited, rotten and callous system.  “All the while, the Government refuses a proper windfall tax and is willing to let energy companies rake in record profits at the expense of the British people, and is about to allow a 40% rise in average household bills in April.  “Only Labour can fix our broken energy system- ending the prepayment meter scandal, stopping bills going up this April with a proper windfall tax and taking the long term action we need to make Britain a clean energy superpower.” An Ofgem spokesperson said: ""“Our compliance reviews were launched to assess and drive-up standards across the industry. Companies are legally required to submit an honest representation of the facts and we required assessments to be signed off by their Boards. It is an extremely serious matter for any licensee to provide misleading or purposefully inaccurate information as part of these reviews. “What is clear, as the Secretary of State has laid out, is that the picture presented by companies may not accurately reflect what is experienced by customers on the ground. Therefore, further reviews will cross examine what we have had reported to us with direct reports from customers and wider stakeholders, and potentially those involved in delivery of services. This will include finding new ways for customers to highlight their concerns to Ofgem."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/energy-firms-given-days-plan-29134645
'The NHS system has turned to mush and desperately needs a reform soon',"Following an experience with his wife in A&E, Sunday People's political editor Nigel Nelson has called for changes to the NHS - because 'a model designed in 1948 doesn’t work for 2023'I shall never get on a horse again. This is because my wife fell off one and broke her pelvis and as mine is getting on a bit, it would be foolhardy to risk bumping it about. We can’t afford our own horse, so we’ve been mucking one out for a friend in return for rides. Maybe the nag didn’t like my greeting of, “Hiya... I’m so hungry I could eat a...” which is not so funny when you are one. And pulverising Claire’s pelvis was revenge. A&E was rammed and we hunkered down for a long wait. But Claire was wheeled straight in to a doctor, on to X-Ray and back to our cubicle, high as a kite on smack.   So far, so good. The young doc seemed a tad too cheery but he later explained that was because he feared her hip was crocked, which is much more serious. Then the shift changed and everything went bits-up. Hours went by and my stoned wife needed a pee. “The loo is round the corner,” I was told. “I know. But she can’t walk.” More hours elapsed and someone poked their head in. “You still here?” “Evidently. Seeing as she can’t walk out.” Which sums up today’s NHS. The staff are wonderful but the system has turned to mush.  Successive governments have buried their heads in the sand because they didn’t want to frighten the... er... horses – i.e. voters. The NHS is maybe our greatest post-war achievement but we should stop being sentimental about it. Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting says it must “reform or die”, that “it’s a service not a shrine.” Those are words politicians were afraid to use until now. As the NHS celebrates its 75th birthday, we must accept a model designed in 1948 doesn’t work for 2023. Polio and TB have gone to be replaced by an ageing population and costly advances in medical science. Taxpayers could buy Greece for the money we spend on the NHS.  Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid told LBC last week: “The current state of affairs is completely unsustainable.”   Might have helped, Saj, if you’d said that when you had the job.  He wants to see a contributory insurance scheme like those which give Germany 7.8 hospital beds for every 1,000 people and France 5.7, compared with our 2.4. But a Sunday People Redfield & Wilton poll today shows fewer than one in three voters would back that. We cling to the mantra of universal free healthcare. Yet the NHS was only totally free for its first three years, so that principle was abandoned long ago. Nine in 10 people qualify for free prescriptions and they should never be charged a bean for anything. But would it really hurt the likes of Nadhim Zahawi to cough up a tenner to see a GP? After his mauling last week, he’ll need that blood pressure check. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/the-nhs-system-turned-mush-29135247

Companies handed £3.7 billion of PPE contracts have links to tax havens,"Government estimates show they have provided half a billion pounds worth of PPE that has been left unused.Companies handed £3.7billion of PPE contracts have links to tax havens, analysis reveals. And government estimates show they have provided half a billion pounds worth of PPE that has been left unused.  Two of the five firms listed by Labour have links to the Conservative Party and were handed their plum contracts through the “VIP lane”.  The biggest winner, Full Support Healthcare, benefited from £2billion of PPE contracts. It is owned by Stoute Enterprises Limited, registered in Jersey. Other contracts were awarded to Uniserve Ltd, owned by a firm registered in Singapore, and Guardian Surgical, run by a company from Hong Kong. Ayanda Capital, whose parent is based in Mauritius, and PPE Medpro – at the centre of the Baroness Mone contracts row – won deals. According to the Financial Times, £65million in profits from PPE Medpro were transferred to The Warren Trust, registered in the Isle of Man.  Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner said: “It’s disgusting that British taxpayers' money has been used to prop up companies with links to tax havens.""    She added: “The fact that over half a billion pounds of PPE they have provided has gone unused, speaks volumes about how little the Government values taxpayers’ money.” The firms are UK registered, and there is no suggestion they have failed to pay any tax due here. And there's no suggestion that all unused PPE was substandard - many items went unused because of procurement and supply issues.  Being UK registered is a legal requirement for those seeking such contracts. All the firms were approached for comment. Stoute and Uniserve said they paid all tax that was due in the UK.

Ex-Tory chairman calls for Dominic Raab to be suspended during bullying investigation,"Sir Jake Berry says the Deputy Prime Minister should be treated like any employee in the private sector, where people facing bullying claims would be stood aside while they're being investigatedA former Tory chairman has called for Dominic Raab to be suspended while he’s investigated over bullying claims. Sir Jake Berry said it would be expected in the private sector for someone facing such allegations to be stood aside while the matter was dealt with.  ""The way these sort of complaints would be dealt with in the private sector is you would be suspended while they were investigated,"" he said in an interview BBC Radio 4's The Week in Westminster.  ""It would be very bizarre if you had someone in any other workplace who wasn't suspended pending that investigation. ""MPs and ministers are not some form of special human being, I think they should just be treated like anyone else is in their workplace."" Sir Jake's intervention will increase the pressure on Mr Raab, who is also the Justice Secretary, who is facing a series of complaints of bullying and abusive behaviour said to involve dozens of civil servants who worked with him.   The FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, has already called for his suspension while the lawyer Adam Tolley KC completes his inquiry into the allegations. Labour has accused Rishi Sunak of being too weak to move against his deputy who was one of his strongest supporters in the battle for the Tory leadership after the resignation of Boris Johnson.  Sir Jake suggested that the rules for ministers should be re-written to create a formal mechanism whereby they would be suspended during an investigation, and then reinstated if they were cleared.  ""We have a system in Parliament that you're either in a job or you're not in a job,"" he said. ""I think that would be a big help to the Prime Minister if he had that additional tool in his box. ""It requires a bit of updating of the ministerial code and I think the public would welcome it."" Mr Sunak says he was not told of any “formal complaints” against Mr Raab before he appointed him as Justice Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister. Mr Raab denies the claims, and has insisted he “behaved professionally at all times.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/ex-tory-chairman-calls-dominic-29131537
Liz Truss has 'half a hope' she can make a comeback and lead Tories in opposition,"The ex-Prime Minister, ousted after just 50 days after a string of disasters, mis-steps and a mini-budget that threatened to crash the UK economy, thinks she has “lost the battle but this is a long game.” Liz Truss has “half a hope” she can make a comeback and lead the Conservative Party in opposition, friends claim.  According to the Times, the ex-Prime Minister, ousted after just 50 days after a string of disasters, missteps and a mini-budget that threatened to crash the UK economy, thinks she has “lost the battle but this is a long game.” The ally added that Ms Truss thinks a future leader “would probably have to be someone from the existing intake.” Ms Truss has been increasingly visible in Parliament in recent days, sparking rumours she’s gearing up for a relaunch of her political career.  Later this month she’ll address a conference of international politicians in Japan, with a “hawkish” speech on China. And it’s understood she’s written a lengthy column in a national newspaper, to be published this weekend. Even as she was forced out of Number 10, Ms Truss maintained she had the right ideas all along.   In her final speech before leaving office, she defended her agenda of extreme, unfunded tax cuts, insisting the Government needed to be “bold.” “It’s not because things are difficult that we do not dare,” she said. “It’s because we do not dare that they are difficult.” Ms Truss is expected to make a number of media appearances in the coming week, having kept a low profile since becoming the shortest-lived prime minister in history. The Conservative backbencher will later this month address a conference of international politicians in Japan, with her speech billed as centring on Beijing's threat to Taiwan. Her allies, including former Cabinet minister Simon Clarke, have recently formed the Conservative Growth Group to push for her tax-cutting agenda.  But her comeback could stoke divisions among Conservative MPs, with many more eager to hastily cut taxes than Mr Sunak and holding a more aggressive stance on China. The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), a campaign group seeking to co-ordinate international pressure on Beijing, is arranging the event where Ms Truss will speak on February 17. She is expected to be joined by two other former prime ministers, Australia's Scott Morrison and Belgium's Guy Verhofstadt. One ally of Ms Truss said the speech will be ""hawkish"", adding: ""She's expected to address Sunak's decision to brand China a strategic competitor rather than a threat."" She had been expected to officially re-designate China as a ""threat"" in official speak, instead of a ""systemic competitor"" during her leadership. In November, Mr Sunak said the ""golden era"" of UK-Chinese relations was over but described the nation as a ""systemic challenge"" rather than a threat.  That marked a dialling down of his language, having called it the ""biggest-long term threat to Britain"" during the summer leadership contest to replace Boris Johnson.   Ms Truss's return to the international stage will follow Mr Johnson's re-mergence, having made visits to Ukraine to visit Volodymyr Zelensky and to the US.

Brexit geniuses stay silent as we lose out by £100bn per year,"Brian Reade marks the third anniversary of leaving the EU by lamenting the huge cost the country has suffered as a resultWHERE was the bonging of Big Ben and pealing of church bells to celebrate the third anniversary of our glorious escape from those evil EU slavemasters? Was I the only one to lapse into a coma this week and miss the usual suspects banging on about how right they were to set Britain on a golden road to prosperity? Or did everyone else also hear a stony silence from the Brexit ­ringleaders, unable to defend Britain’s most catastrophic act of self-harm since Thatcher flogged our public utilities to City spivs. Mind you, as the International Monetary Fund predicts the UK will perform worse this year than any other major economy, citing Brexit as a major cause, what was there to say? Rishi Sunak muttered something which sounded like a Fast Show sketch: “Whether it’s leading Europe’s fastest vaccine rollout, striking trade deals with over 70 countries or taking back control of our borders, we have forged a path as an independent nation with confidence.” Oh dear. Is that it? The vaccine was speedy because we had the NHS database, the trade deals have either replicated existing EU ones or been of minuscule benefit, like the one with Australia that will see GDP rise by less than 0.1% a year, and we were told a pact with America would be a doddle but it’s nowhere in sight. As for taking back control of our borders, how’s that going? Asking for a friend in Dover. Brexit did hand the EU control of their borders, which is why Brits face lengthy passport queues and Eurostar leaves a third of its seats empty due to crippling delays. Back in 2016, anyone pointing out the economic damage this ill-thought-out jingoistic fantasy would cause were told they were fact inventors who were part of Project Fear. So let’s look at the facts three years on from freedom day: trade has fallen by almost 20%, Brexit has added 6% to food prices, and inflation and energy is more costly here than anywhere in Europe. Economists calculate EU withdrawal is costing the UK £100billion a year, one of the reasons being businesses are strangled by the very red tape Leavers wanted to be rid of. Ours will be the only major country with negative growth this year and the only one whose economy is smaller now than it was before Covid. Our productivity has slumped by 4% because we have alarming gaps in the workforce, partly due to Europeans staying away. Even with the increased immigration from other parts of the world we are 330,000 down on immigrant workers needed to do key jobs. And the British nation knows this. Hence a survey that shows of 632 UK constituencies, only one has more people in it who now think Brexit was a good idea than a bad one. It still baffles me that millions of sane voters fell for the guff spouted by proven liars like Boris Johnson, right-wing extremists like Nigel Farage, and intellectual mediocrities like Jacob Rees-Mogg. We can’t turn back the clock. We have to make the best of an awful hand, as high-profile Brexiteers never tire of telling us. But wouldn’t it be nice if those same shysters, many of whom made a fortune out of Brexit, admitted that they were guilty of either criminal deception or rank stupidity? Then disappeared from public view for good.",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/brexit-geniuses-stay-silent-lose-29126395

Mr Johnson, 58, now a backbench MP who has trousered more than £1 million giving speeches since he left Downing Street, said he's enjoying his life post-PM by learning to paint the farmyard animals. He told Ms Dorries, 65: ""I’ve got a project which is to master the form of the cow."" He later wants to master the horse.  At one point, he even called Labour leader Keir Starmer a 'crasheroonie snoozefest, the human bollard' while insisting the Conservative Party have a big chance of winning the next election.    Towards the end of the chat, Mr Johnson admitted his 'death row meal' would be bangers and mash. And Ms Dorries ended her interview with Mr Johnson by admitting she 'almost wet' herself from nerves.  Viewers were confounded by the hour-long programme, which took many random turns and took to Twitter to complain about it.  ""Friday night car crash interview with Nadine Dorries,"" one user complained. Another added: ""Boris Johnson's latest output. He really is brimming full of sh** ffs. And Nads is gladly lapping it up...""  ""Popped into #TalkTV - could only stomach 5 mins of Johnson being “interviewed” by Nads Dorries,"" one concerned user posted. ""Really the two of them deserve each other - a political nightmare! She’s hanging on his every word.""   Another said: ""Johnson waffles about cows Nadine giggles. * cringe level raised to Defcon 1."" However, some viewers loved the chat and defended the former PM. ""Dang, I’ve missed Boris! So nice to have him back on our screens,"" a fan commented.  Elsewhere in the interview, Mr Johnson claimed anyone who believes he knowingly covered up illegal parties at No10 is ""out of their mind"". The shamed former Prime Minister was forced to quit after a rebellion by his own MPs but said in the interview that he was acting within the rules.  Mr Johnson became the first Prime Minister in history to be sanctioned by police while in office after being fined for breaching Covid regulations, and he faces a probe by MPs into whether he misled Parliament. He said: ""As you know there’s a Parliamentary Committee looking into some aspects of this and I had better be respectful of them. ""But I’ll just repeat what I've said before, and I hope it's obvious to everybody, that anybody who thinks I was knowingly going to parties that were breaking lockdown rules in No10, and then knowingly covering up parties that were illicit that other people were going to, that’s all strictly for the birds. ""And if anybody thinks like that they’re out of their mind.”  * Follow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

'Rishi Sunak must end strike farce by giving NHS staff the pay rise they deserve',"Nurses in England are not to blame for disruption caused by strike action next week - Rishi Sunak could resolve the dispute if he gives NHS staff a pay rise they desperately needUnion leaders in Wales have called off next week’s strikes by nurses and ambulance workers after agreeing a pay offer. Industrial action by nurses in Scotland has been paused as they seek to negotiate a deal. The only place in Great Britain where the strikes will go ahead is in England. If the Welsh Government is able to find the additional money, then so can the one in Westminster. Rishi Sunak could resolve these disputes in an instant. All he has to do is instruct the Treasury to open its purse strings and give NHS staff the pay rise they deserve and so desperately need. His refusal to take this action is not an economic decision, but a political one. Instead of taking the path of conciliation he has opted for the route of confrontation. When nurses in England walk out on Monday and Tuesday, everyone should know they are not to blame for the disruption. The responsibility lies entirely with the Tories in Westminster. Locals heroes   In many places, the local pub is the bedrock of the community. When they close, people do not just lose a place to drink but a vital local hub. So we should all, drinkers and non-drinkers alike, be concerned that 21 pubs shut their doors each week in the second half of last year. The industry fears this situation could get worse when the energy support scheme for businesses is wound up at the end of March. Some pubs’ energy bills have increased by more than 300% in the last year. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt needs to rethink the decision to withdraw support. If he presses ahead with the move, even more landlords will be calling last orders for the final time. Fright owl  Residents in the West Midlands town of Sedgley say they are being terrorised by a great-horned owl. The aggressive bird of prey is apparently no hoot. He’s certainly ruffled a few feathers. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/rishi-sunak-must-end-strike-29129535
"'Weak' Rishi Sunak can't call an election as he knows he would lose, says Rachel Reeves","Labour's Rachel Reeves warned that Rishi Sunak is 'holding us back as a country' as he drowns in sleaze scandals - and says he lost to Liz Truss who 'in turn lost to a lettuce... He's not a winner this guy'Rishi Sunak cannot hold a general election because he knows he would lose, Rachel Reeves has said. The Shadow Chancellor warned the “weak” PM is “holding us back as a country”, as she argued the Tories are “out of time and out of ideas”. In an outspoken interview with the Mirror, she suggested Mr Sunak is either “incurious or stupid” for failing to get to the bottom of the sleaze scandals involving his ministers. And she demanded the Chancellor freeze fuel duty in next month’s Budget so working people are not “clobbered” with not another Tory tax rise. Ms Reeves said Mr Sunak’s decision to not sack Deputy PM Dominic Raab despite the mounting list of bullying allegations against him “shows how weak he is”. “He doesn't have a real say over who he wants in his team because he's too weak in his own party,” she told the Mirror as she made a visit to the high street in East Finchley, north London.   “This is a guy who fought the leadership against Liz Truss and lost and Liz Truss in turn lost to a lettuce. He's not a winner this guy. “He can't hold an election because he knows he would lose that as well. He's a weak leader. And he can't get rid of these people.” Ms Reeves mocked Mr Sunak’s claim he was unaware Nadhim Zahawi was in trouble over his taxes until after he appointed him as Conservative Party chairman. “The idea that the Prime Minister is the only person in the world who didn't know that he was being investigated for tax dodging... He is either incurious or stupid,” she said. The Shadow Chancellor warned that the constant sleaze scandals are distracting the government from getting on with rebuilding the economy. “The Prime Minister at the moment, is having to deal with crisis after crisis because he's too weak to take decisive action,” she said. “As a result, the attention that needs to be focused on how to stabilise and how to grow our economy, there’s no space for it. His weakness is now holding us back as a country.” Ahead of the Budget, Ms Reeves is calling for Jeremy Hunt to drop a 12p per litre rise in fuel duty that is pencilled in for next month.  “Most people rely on their car to get to work, to get to appointments, etc,” she said. “At the moment, in the government's plans is the biggest ever increase in fuel duty. “We've got inflation at 10.5%, close to the highest it's been in 40 years. When you've got the weekly food shop going up, gas and electricity bills going up again in April, the mortgage payments and the rent going up. “The idea that what we need right now is a big increase in fuel duty, it will just make matters much, much worse, particularly for working people.” A poll for the Mirror yesterday revealed more than half of voters want a general election now And more than 149,000 people have now signed the Mirror's petition on the 38 Degrees website calling for one. But Mr Sunak has ruled out a snap poll. “We have had 13 years now,” Ms Reeves said. “The question people are going to be asking at the next election is are my family and I better off than we were 13 years ago? “Are our schools and our hospitals in a better state than they were 13 years ago? “Frankly, is there anything in Britain that is working better today than when the Conservatives came to government? The answer to those questions is no.” She added: “I think people know that this government is out of time and out of ideas. I can understand why he doesn't want the election, but I think the country does.” * Follow Mirror Politics on Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter and Facebook.

Seven out of 10 junior doctors treated patients despite not feeling well enough,"The British Medical Association said ministers' failure to get a grip of the NHS crisis is 'not only threatening patient safety, but is also putting junior doctors’ health at serious risk'More than 70% of junior doctors have treated patients despite not feeling well enough in the last three months, a damning survey shows.  The British Medical Association (BMA) said ministers' failure to get a grip of the NHS crisis is “not only threatening patient safety, but is also putting junior doctors’ health at serious risk”.  Its study of almost 3,000 junior doctors in England found 71% came to work despite not being well enough to perform their duties in the past three months. Some 78% have felt unwell as a result of work-related stress in the last year alone. And 81% said their health and wellbeing has worsened or not improved since December 2021 – when Covid-related pressures pushed NHS staff to breaking point. The BMA is balloting junior doctors in England on strike action, with the result expected at the end of the month. They could be the latest band of NHS staff to join nurses, paramedics, physios and midwives in staging walkouts.   Junior doctors’ pay has been cut by 26.1% in real terms since 2008/09, according to the BMA. Low pay and poor working conditions is creating an exodus of NHS staff. The Mirror revealed last week more than one in 10 health workers left the ailing NHS last year in a new grim record. Around seven in 10 junior doctors say they “always or frequently” work in understaffed rotas, which could be placing patient and staff safety at risk, the survey found. It has led to more than half of junior doctors (51%) describing their desire to work in the NHS in the next year as “low” or “very low”. The BMA says it fears the mounting strain being placed on junior doctors will have a lasting impact on workforce numbers as doctors become increasingly burnt out and leave the NHS.  One junior doctor anonymously told the union: “I became a doctor to help people but the current state of the NHS is preventing staff like me from providing the standard of care we have been trained to give and that we think patients deserve. “When you're covering so many patients in a day, hungry and with no breaks, you simply can't do a good job by them.  “The conditions we’re working in make it a daily battle to keep patients somewhat safe. “I have come into work when ill because I know my trust is understaffed and I want to keep patients safe. “Like so many of my colleagues, I do question whether it is worth staying in the NHS, as the current situation is totally unsustainable.” Dr Robert Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trivedi, BMA junior doctors committee co-chairs, said: “This Government needs to stop pretending that the pressures we’re seeing this winter isn’t a crisis of their own making. “Ministers have failed to step up and their failure to resource and staff the health service properly is not only threatening patient safety, but is also putting junior doctors’ health at serious risk. “No doctor deserves to work in horrendous conditions while not being valued or supported to do their job properly. “Continual devaluing of their life saving work will drive more junior doctors away, and the vicious cycle of staffing shortages will continue. “Until we restore our pay to restore our workforce, this will only get worse. The Government needs to get real and get to the table to discuss.” It comes ahead of a massive day of strike action in the NHS on Monday when nurses and ambulance workers will down tools in a dispute over pay. Walkouts in Wales were called off on Friday after a last-minute pay offer from the Senedd. But Downing Street said no talks were planned between ministers and unions over the weekend to resolve strikes in England. A No10 spokesman said: ""The Prime Minister believes that the way to resolve these disputes is talking, we want to encourage unions to get around the table without inflicting the disruption we've seen on the British people. ""Our focus will be on mitigating the disruption caused by the strikes."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/seven-out-10-junior-doctors-29127517
Boris Johnson's five bizarre claims in cringeworthy interview with superfan Nadine Dorries,"In a cosy interview on staunch ally Nadine Dorries's new TalkTV show, Boris Johnson rambled on about painting cows, Tory election prospects andDeluded Boris Johnson has claimed the Tories could ""absolutely"" win the next election despite Rishi Sunak's scandal-hit Tories languishing in the polls. The shamed former Prime Minister suggested his successor could lead the party to victory as a poll today gave Labour a 24-point lead over the Conservatives. But in a cosy interview on staunch ally Nadine Dorries's new TalkTV show, Mr Johnson called on Britain to send more tanks to Ukraine - piling pressure on Rishi Sunak. The remorseless Tory also claimed anyone who believes he knowingly covered up illegal parties at No10 was ""out of their mind"". And he made a series of bizarre admissions about how he's filling his time since he was ousted from Downing Street - from learning to paint cows to building a quadbike garage for his kids.  Mr Johnson is the first guest on the ex-Culture Secretary's Friday night show, which has already earned her a ticking off from Parliament's revolving door watchdog.  Lord Pickles, chair of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), said she had broken the rules by failing to seek advice before taking on the role. Here are the bizarre claims from his TalkTV appearance.  People 'out of their mind' if they think he covered up Partygate Mr Johnson faces being hauled before MPs within weeks to face accusations he misled Parliament over lockdown-busting No10 bashes. But he struck a bullish note over the Partygate saga which sank his premiership and could also see him ousted from Parliament if he's found to have misled MPs.  He said: ""I hope it's obvious to everybody, that anybody who thinks I was knowingly going to parties that were breaking lockdown rules in No10, and then knowingly covering up parties that were illicit that other people were going to, that’s all strictly for the birds. ""And if anybody thinks like that they’re out of their mind.” Brexit 'saved lives' by speeding up the vaccine rollout Mr Johnson also doubled down on his disputed claim that Brexit sped up the UK's vaccine rollout. He said: ""It is literally true that Brexit helped save lives. And people’s eyes bulge a bit when you say that, but it happens to be true… I'm proud of that. I’m proud of all the work that those people did.” Full Fact has previously rubbished this claim, saying that the UK always had the right to give temporary approval to an unlicensed medicinal product in crises such as a pandemic. MHRA boss Dr June Raine confirmed in 2020 that the vaccine was approved under EU law.  Asked if Brexit made the process quicker, she said: “We have been able to authorise the supply of the vaccine using provisions under European law which exist until 1 January."" The Tories can 'absolutely' win the next election Mr Johnson insisted the Tories could win the next election - due by January 2025 - despite their dire poll ratings. “Let me be very clear… The fact is that the Conservative Party can certainly win the next election - yes, absolutely,” he claimed.  “We've got almost two years to go before there has to be an election.” Ex-PM spends his time painting cows Consigned to the back benches, Mr Johnson said he is spending time learning how to paint cows.  He said: “At the moment I’ve got a project, which is to master the form of the cow. Cows are actually far more difficult to draw than you think."" He rambled about he was filling a book with ""pictures of parts of cows"". ""My objective is to master the cow,"" he said. ""I’m getting there. Next stop the horse after that.”  He finds the Pink Panther so funny he 'almost blacks out' The ex-PM rambled about his love for the Pink Panther films, which he said he watches with his children. He said: ""I find the Pink Panther films... I laugh so much I almost black out."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnsons-five-bizarre-claims-29128726
PCSO numbers plummet as Tories branded 'asleep at the wheel' - see in your area,"Analysis by the House of Commons Library found that the number of community police officers have fallen by more than 4,000 since 2015 across England and Wales. See how your area has been affectedThe Tories have been accused of being ""asleep at the wheel"" on neighbourhood crime as new figures reveal drastic cuts to police support officers. Analysis by the House of Commons Library found that PCSO numbers plummeted by more than 4,000 since 2015 across England and Wales. There were 12,331 PCSOs in 2015, but by September 2022 this number had fallen to just 8,263 - a drop of 4,068 officers, the data shows. PCSOs were scrapped entirely in Norfolk in a cost-cutting measure in 2018, meaning the 197 community officers in 2015 are all gone. They were replaced with 81 new police officers. The other worst-hit police forces include Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, South Yorkshire, Essex, London, Devon & Cornwall, Nottinghamshire, Bedfordshire and Lincolnshire.   Cuts in these areas add up to 1,339 PCSOs - accounting for over a quarter of total losses in England and Wales since 2015. In London, the Metropolitan Police has seen 633 fewer PCSOs on the streets - or 35.4% drop - over the same time period. And Hampshire Police - in Home Secretary Suella Braverman’s backyard - residents have lost 87 PCSOs - over 28% of their total numbers - since 2015.  Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael said: ""The Conservatives are asleep at the wheel when it comes to tackling community crime. ""They spend their time trying to appear tough on crime when in reality failing to do what actually works to prevent it. ""Police Community Support Officers play a key role in keeping our communities safe. ""The Government should be supporting them, not slashing their numbers into oblivion.""

NHS walkouts off in Wales but No10 says no talks to avert strikes in England,"Members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) will walk out on Monday and Tuesday in England, while GMB members employed by the ambulance service will also strike on MondayDowning Street was today unable to name a single step being taken to prevent thousands of nurses and ambulance workers going on strike next week - despite walkouts in Wales being scrapped. Members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) will again walk out on Monday and Tuesday in England, while GMB members employed by the ambulance service will strike on Monday. But both unions have cancelled action in Wales after talks with the Welsh government. Quizzed on whether the government plans any last-minute talks in an effort to reach a deal, a No10 spokesman said the onus was on unions to ""get around the table"". It comes despite huge public support for a better pay deal for health workers. This afternoon the unions announced their action had been suspended in Wales to allow further negotiations with the Welsh government. But England remains in deadlock.    RCN general secretary Pat Cullen said: “If the other governments can negotiate and find more money for this year, the Prime Minister can do the same. Rishi Sunak has no place left to hide. His unwillingness to help nursing is being exposed as a personal choice, not an economic necessity. “Again, we are making good on our commitment to cancel strikes when ministers negotiate and make pay offers to our members. First in Scotland and now in Wales too. “If the Prime Minister decides to leave England’s nurses as the lowest paid in the UK, he must expect this strike to continue. He can still turn things around before Monday – start talking seriously and the strikes are off.” A No10 spokesman said: ""The Prime Minister believes that the way to resolve these disputes is talking, we want to encourage unions to get around the table without inflicting the disruption we've seen on the British people. ""Our focus will be on mitigating the disruption caused by the strikes."" He said that the Education Secretary and Health Secretary had held talks earlier this week, but did not say any more were scheduled. Asked whether the government's plan was to wait for unions to give up, the spokesman said: ""No, I wouldn't characterise it like that. ""We want to see unions continue to talk with their employers.""  Members of the GMB were due to walk out in Wales and England on Monday alongside members of other unions. The GMB said its action has been suspended in Wales to allow further negotiations with the Welsh Government. The union said the proposed deal amounts to both a consolidated and non-consolidated one-off payment for 22/23 - on top of an increase of 4.5% which has already been paid. GMB official Nathan Holman said: ""After intense negotiations, GMB has agreed to suspend strike action while further talks take place. ""We recognise that the Welsh Government and Welsh Ambulance have made concessions and, through social partnership, we appreciate the frank and open dialogue with them over the last few months. ""This has only been made possible because the Welsh Government has been prepared to talk about pay - a lesson for those in charge on the other side of the Severn Bridge."" Last night Rishi Sunak doubled down on not coming up with a better offer for NHS staff. He told Piers Morgan: “Nurses should be an exception [to public-service pay restraint] and that’s because they do an incredible job for all of us and they demonstrated that during the pandemic. “I’m really grateful to them for that, and you’re right I grew up in an NHS family. So this does burn deeply inside me. “I would love to give nurses a massive pay rise. Who wouldn’t? Certainly that would make my life easier, wouldn’t it?” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/breaking-nhs-walkouts-wales-no10-29124971
Nadine Dorries and Boris Johnson's friendship - unwavering ally and 'rock star' remark,"Boris Johnson is set to speak with Nadine Dorries about the Partygate scandal that ended his term as Prime Minister in a chat tonight on TalkTVNadine Dorries has been given her own Friday night talk show and she's using the platform to interview her chum Boris Johnson - but will she be giving him a fair grilling? Nadine, 65, served as Culture Secretary under Mr Johnson and she's been a loyal ally to the beleaguered politician ever since.  She's publicly spoken out and defended the shamed former Prime Minister, saying he's ""one of world's greatest leaders"" - even though he was booted out of office last year after a rebellion by his own MPs.  And now he's set to be the first guest on the new show which goes live on TalkTV tonight, and it's expected he'll open up about the Partygate scandal - exposed by The Mirror - that ended his term as Prime Minister. Ms Dorries, who was Culture Secretary between 2021 and last year, is Mr Johnson's most steadfast ally - claiming Tories should bring him back 'or die '.    What do you think about Boris Johnson? Let us know in the comments... It is unlikely the controversial MP will ask searching questions of Mr Johnson, having described him as a ""political rock star"". She refused to turn on him after he became mired in a number of scandals, and repeatedly claimed he had been stabbed in the back as his party turned on him.  In a bitter attack on current PM Rishi Sunak, she said: ""With Rishi in No10, we are heading into the long, cold and brutal wasteland of thankless opposition"".    In a Mail on Sunday column, she added: ""For the Conservatives, it's bring back Boris or die because the first task of any Labour government would be to ensure that there'll never be a majority Conservative government ever again.""  The show hasn't even gone to air yet and Ms Dorries has already been slapped down by Westminster's revolving door watchdog over the forthcoming TV show. Watchdog chair Lord Pickles was left fuming after she failed to seek advice from his body before taking the job. All former ministers are required to ask the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) before taking a new job within two years of leaving Government.  By failing to do so, Ms Dorries apparently broke the ministerial code. Previously, Ms Dorries continued to maintain that Mr Johnson is ""one of the world's best leaders"" - and didn't rule out returning to Government if her old boss comes back. At the time, she stopped short of attacking Mr Johnson's successor - Liz Truss - claiming markets had ""pretty dramatically overreacted"". She said that the former Prime Minister, whose three years and 44 days in office were dogged by scandal, is ""definitely having a nicer life at the moment"" But she was tight-lipped when asked if she would take up a frontbench role if Mr Johnson takes the helm again.  Speaking at the time from her home in the Cotswolds, Ms Dorries said that she felt ""quite sorrowful and disappointed about how I think we removed one of the world's best leaders"". The ardent loyalist, who remained at her boss's side while dozens of Tories finally had enough, claimed some within the party ""behaved very badly"", and said she would find it ""very difficult"" to continue working in a positive way after his departure. She claimed Mr Johnson was ""the only one that was going to maintain a stable poll position"", saying it was ""clear that people voted not always for the Conservatives — they voted for Boris"".  Since leaving office, Mr Johnson has already banked more than £500,000 for a memoir about his disastrous time in Downing Street. He trousered an astonishing £276,130 for a single speech in Colorado Springs in October - while the Commons was in session 5,000 miles away. The update to the register also shows Mr Johnson received over £200,000 for a speaking engagement in December and £3,000 from the Spectator magazine. It comes as taxpayers are expected to foot a £220,000 bill for the former Prime Minister's legal defence against allegations he misled Parliament over Partygate - which is expected to be debated on the show tonight.  Talking about the show, Ms Dorries said: ""As someone who's never been afraid to speak their mind, I'm delighted to be joining the team at TalkTV for Friday Night with Nadine, where I'll be putting my 23-year political career and experiences at the despatch box to good use. ""Boris Johnson continues to dominate so much of the political narrative since his departure from No 10. Now's the time to find out what he really thinks about a whole range of pressing issues."" TalkTV described the show as ""an irreverent look at the week's news and a lively mix of topical chat with guests from the world of politics, culture and sport"". In October she briefly stood in for Morgan on his Uncensored show while the former Good Morning Britain presenter was on holiday.   Richard Wallace, head of TV, News Broadcasting, said: ""Nadine has a unique voice in British politics and will bring that unique voice to our air. ""She has had a seat at the top table of British politics during extraordinary times; knows all the key players and has true insight into how the corridors of power actually work.  ""And, as a former nurse, she's one of very few politicians to have held down a proper job and worried about paying the bills, so our audience will relish her take.""  Friday Night with Nadine starts on TalkTV tonight, February 3, from 8pm.   Do you have a story to sell?

Opponents hit out as rape tweet row Tory escapes punishment despite comments,"Councillor Shaun Slator remains suspended from the Conservative Party amid an investigation following his web post about an alleged rape last monthCampaigners have hit out after a Tory councillor who suggested an alleged rape victim was “likely” to be a prostitute escaped punishment. The Mirror revealed last month how Shaun Slator made the slur in a tweet reacting to an online news story about the alleged sex attack being probed by police.  Underneath a Twitter post of a web media report headlined “Woman raped in Plumstead park in early hours” - and which included a police comment - he wrote: “More likely that it's a punter that didn't pay.”  His comments were referred to Bromley Council in South East London, which commissioned a probe after receiving complaints. But a leaked copy of the report found Mr Slator was not acting in his capacity as a councillor when he posted the tweet - and decided he should not be sanctioned. The investigator said they were “agonised” about their conclusion. The council’s monitoring officer decided there was no breach of its code of conduct - meaning no further investigation would take place. Read More
  The report said: “It is appreciated that this view will perplex and disappoint some, if not all the complainants and other people. “The finding in no way suggests that either the monitoring officer or the independent person endorse the behaviour of Councillor Slator. They do not.” Julie Ireland, the Lib Dems’ group leader on the council, told the Mirror: “When I heard that Councillor Slator was not going to be sanctioned for his disgusting comments I was shocked. “What message does this send to the women and girls in his ward … if he is allowed to get away with this abhorrent attempt to excuse a violent attack? “He has shown a complete disrespect for women everywhere and Bromley Council’s failure to act reflects badly on the entire organisation.” Labour's group leader Simon Jeal said the Tories should decide whether the “misogynistic, vile comments are acceptable for an elected representative of their party to make”.  He added: “The report makes clear the council’s investigators were forced to this decision by the prescribed legal rules for councillors’ conduct - despite their ‘abhorrence’ for Councillor Slater’s tweet, they ‘could not escape’ this conclusion.  “The report goes out of its way to make clear they do not endorse his views but determine the matter should be addressed by the Conservative Party, not Bromley Council.”  A Conservative spokesman said: “As this matter is currently under investigation, we cannot comment at this time.” It is understood Mr Slator remains suspended from the party. Contacted by the Mirror, he said: “I’ve got no comment for you guys.” Asked if he was “happy with the outcome of the report”, he hung up. Bromley Council was contacted for comment.

Joy as new law to protect jobs of pregnant women and new parents backed,"Dan Jarvis told MPs they had a ""precious opportunity within our grasp to make a real difference to over 50,000 pregnant women and new parents each year""A new law giving extra job protection to pregnant women and new parents has cleared the Commons after being put forward by a Labour MP. Dan Jarvis told MPs they had a ""precious opportunity within our grasp to make a real difference to over 50,000 pregnant women and new parents each year"". His bill - which will provide extra protection to women during and after pregnancy, as well as measures to support new dads - passed unopposed. It will mean employers have a legal duty to prioritise soon-to-be and new parents facing redundancy by offering them - not inviting them to apply for - a suitable alternative vacancy. He said after it went through: ""This is a fantastic result. I'm delighted with the progress that we've made.""   Mr Jarvis told the Commons: ""Many of us here know all too well the trials and tribulations of becoming a new parent.  ""Everything can be a worry. How quickly or slowly your newborn is hitting milestones - breastfeeding, rolling over, sitting, crawling, a never-ending list of questions racing through your mind. ""A lot of these worries are about issues that are beyond our control, but today we have the chance to alleviate some of that anxiety by ensuring that one of the things new parents are less worried about is whether they will have a job to return to after taking parental leave."" The Protection from Redundancy (Pregnancy and Family Leave) Bill was supported by MPs unopposed and will now undergo further scrutiny in the House of Lords. Mr Jarvis added: ""I think what new parents need as a minimum is job security, and this Bill seeks to provide that by increasing security in the workplace for both pregnant women and new parents by extending redundancy protections.  ""This means that a statutory duty will be placed on employers to prioritise soon-to-be and new parents in a redundancy situation, by offering them, not inviting them to apply for, a suitable alternative vacancy if their job becomes at risk."" Business minister Kevin Hollinrake said the Government was ""pleased"" to support the Bill, adding: ""These measures will provide invaluable support and protection for pregnant women and new parents. A little bit more security during these times in people's lives is so important. ""The evidence and analysis of the need to introduce additional protection is absolutely clear to the Government."" Mr Hollinrake said the measures are ""wholly in line with our ongoing commitment to support workers and build a high-skilled, high-productivity, high-wage economy"".

"UK steel industry on brink of 'irreversible decline', MPs warn Rishi Sunak","The Prime Minister has been issued with a stark alert, in a letter seen by the Mirror, about the threat to sector as companies mull job cuts and firms demand help to slash emissionsBritain's steel industry risks plunging into “irreversible decline” unless the Tories intervene, MPs warned tonight. A cross-party group has written to Rishi Sunak urging him to back moves to make the sector less polluting. A dozen Labour, Conservative and Welsh and Scottish nationalist Independent MPs have signed the letter, seen exclusively by the Mirror, calling on the Prime Minister to act. The letter warns the PM: “We are concerned that in the absence of government support the UK risks becoming the first G20 economy to see its domestic steel production go into irreversible decline.” Describing steel as “a vital, strategic industry in the UK”, the MPs call on Mr Sunak to “act now to safeguard the future of the industry”. Read More
  The warning comes as 800 jobs hang in the balance at British Steel, and with 440 jobs under threat at Liberty Steel. The MPs’ letter says: “Without a domestic steel sector competitively producing green steel, the UK will lose a vital pillar in its resilience to global supply chain shocks and security challenges. “We need to invest in and transform this strategically important industry to ensure the UK is resilient in the face of such disruptive geo-political events. “Without adequate support, we will inevitably offshore our emissions by importing steel from abroad without any of the benefits of domestic production.” UK steel is blamed for 14% of the UK’s industrial emissions and 2.7% of all Britain’s greenhouse gases.  Steel bosses have spent the past year pleading with ministers to help the transition to “green steel”, by switching to less-harmful production methods. The MPs stress the sector “fundamentally underpins our entire manufacturing sector, being an essential material to the UK’s automotive, construction, engineering and packaging sectors. “Furthermore, steel will be an integral part of the UK’s journey to reach net zero”. They added: “There can be no transition to a low-carbon economy, supporting a range of industries from automotive to nuclear and renewables, without a thriving steel industry. “Almost every aspect of the UK’s decarbonisation plan is steel intensive.” Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, whose Aberavon constituency includes Britain’s biggest steelworks, Tata at Port Talbot, said: “It is absolutely vital that we make our steel here in Britain.  “The British Government must match the ambition of our European competitors in the level of investment offered to domestic steel producers.” Mr Kinnock, who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Steel, added: “Every day of dither and delay is another day that our competitors gain an advantage as they forge ahead with the de-carbonisation of their steel companies and broader manufacturing industries.” Britain’s £2.4billion steel industry directly employs 33,700 workers, with another 43,000 staff in supply chains. The Mirror has been campaigning to Save Our Steel since the sector was hit by plant closures and thousands of job losses in 2015. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy was contacted for comment. A Government spokesman said: “It is very disappointing to hear of potential redundancies at British Steel while negotiations on a very generous package of support from the Government are ongoing. “We consider the success of the steel sector a priority and will continue to work intensively with the industry to help secure a decarbonised, sustainable and competitive future. “This is on top of significant action already taken to protect the steel industry from unfair trade and energy costs including £800million in relief for electricity costs and access to support funds worth £1.5billion to cut emissions and become more energy efficient.”  * Follow Mirror Politics on Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter and Facebook ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/uk-steel-industry-brink-irreversible-29125339
China breaks silence on mystery 'spy' balloon seen in skies above the US,"China said the ominous balloon was a civilian “airship” used for meteorological research and due to its limited steering capability, it had “deviated far from its planned courseThe ominous balloon spotted over the US is a ""civilian airship"" which had deviated from its planned route, China has said. China’s foreign ministry broke its silence on Friday over the balloon that the US suspected was conducting surveillance. It said it was a civilian “airship” used for meteorological research and due to its limited steering capability, it had “deviated far from its planned course” after being blown off course. Beijing added it regretted it had blown off its course. While defence officials said the balloon’s current flight path carries it over “a number of sensitive” military sites, it is believed that US President Joe Biden decided against shooting it out of the sky due to risks of falling debris.   It was first spotted over Billings, Montana, on Wednesday which is very close to one of the US's three nuclear missile silo fields at Malmstrom Air Force Base. The balloon is still in US airspace but officials declined to say where it is now. Prior to that, it had flown over the Aleutian Islands, off the coast of Alaska and through Canada. The balloon is ""the size of three buses"" and has a visible ""technology bay"", US media reported, including solar panels to power the surveillance device.  Alexander Neill, an analyst at Hawaii’s Pacific Forum think tank, said the balloon's intelligence gathering was likely limited, suggesting its real intention may be more political. ""China has its own constellation of spy and military satellites that are far more important and effective in terms of watching the US, so I think it is a fair assumption that the intelligence gain is not huge,"" Mr Neill said to the Telegraph. The Chinese statement read: ""Affected by the Westerlies and with limited self-steering capability, the airship deviated far from its planned course. ""The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into US airspace due to force majeure."" It also said it would continue to communicate with the US side. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was set to meet China's President Xi Jinping in Beijing, which would have made him the first US secretary of state to sit down with the Chinese leader in nearly six years. However, because of the balloon, he has now cancelled the visit. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-china-breaks-silence-mystery-29126291
Energy bills to rise by 20% from April despite wholesale gas prices tumbling by 70%,"Struggling households will see average bills rise from £2,500 to £3,000 a year in the spring after the Tories decided to cut subsidy levels under the Energy Price GuaranteeEnergy bills will surge by 20% from April despite wholesale gas prices crashing by 70% and giving the Government a ­predicted saving of £11billion.  Struggling households will see average bills rise from £2,500 to £3,000 a year in the spring after the Tories decided to cut subsidy levels under the Energy Price Guarantee. A £400 payment for all households will also end. Meanwhile, think-tank the Resolution Foundation estimates the dip in wholesale gas prices since August’s peak means the cost of the EPG for the year from April has tumbled from £12.8billion to £1.5bn.  This is due to not having to subsidise bills when they fall below the £3,000 threshold and the saving will be partly offset by lower than expected income from windfall taxes on North Sea producers.  Yet households look like having to wait until later this year for bills to fall.    The Resolution Foundation estimates they will still average £2,400 over the whole of the 12 months from April – a 20% hike on the average £2,000 a year over the past year. Before the pandemic, average bills were £1,200 a year. Resolution Foundation economist Emily Fry said: “Falling wholesale gas prices have been the big economic good news story of the year.  ""This will bring real benefits to families, even if it might not feel like it for some time to come.” She added that the savings on the EPG will give Chancellor Jeremy Hunt a windfall in next month’s Budget.   A surge in energy bills in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is one of the reasons inflation has hit a 40-year-high.  The drop in wholesale prices is expected to take some of the heat out of living costs as the year goes on.  Ms Fry added: “The cost of living crisis is far from over but falling gas prices mean it’s looking less bleak than just a few months ago.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/energy-bills-rise-20-april-29150457
BP profits DOUBLE to record £23billion as millions suffer with sky-high energy bills,"BP has reported an annual profit of £23billion which is the highest in its history with a whopping £23billion having been made in the last three months of 2022 aloneBP has reported the highest profit in its entire history at $27.7billion (£23billion) for last year as households across the country continue to struggle with energy bills. This is up from the $12.8billion the firm recorded in 2021 and sparks further calls for energy companies to pay more in tax. BP reported net profit of $4.81billion (£3.89billion) for the last three months of 2022 - down from the $8.2billion it raked in for July to September, but up from the $4billion reported a year earlier. The oil giant has seen its financial performance go through the roof thanks to soaring oil and gas prices which first started rising after Covid and have been accelerated further due to the war in Ukraine. Speaking in response to the huge profits today, Bernard Looney, chief executive officer of BP, said the company was ""helping provide the energy the world needs"".   He added: “We are strengthening BP, with our strongest upstream plant reliability on record and our lowest production costs in 16 years, helping to generate strong returns and reducing debt for the 11th quarter in a row. “Importantly, we are delivering for our shareholders – with buybacks and a growing dividend. This is exactly what we said we would do and will continue to do – performing while transforming.” Tessa Khan, executive director of Uplift - which campaigns against fossil fuels - said: ""It's unconscionable that companies like BP can make this kind of money, while at the same time pensioners are having their homes broken into because they can't afford their gas bill. ""These are profits that BP is taking from us in higher energy and fuel bills. It is grossly unfair. The UK's energy system isn't just broken, it's inhumane.  ""This Government needs to get a grip and fix this now, starting by taxing these profits properly. Rishi Sunak must immediately close the £11billion loophole that he introduced the windfall tax.""  In the first three months of last year, BP brought in £5.12billion followed by £6.9billion in the second quarter. It comes after rival Shell saw profits soar to £32.2billion ($39.9billion) last year - the highest in its 115-year history. The Government has introduced a windfall tax off the back of huge profits being raked in by energy firms - called the Energy Profits Levy - but this only applies to profits made from UK oil and gas. The rate has been increased from 25% to 35%. BP had previously said it expects to pay $800million in windfall tax for 2022. Last month, the Mirror reported that five of the world's biggest oil companies are expected to an ""obscene"" £160billion profit bonanza when they all reveal their latest financial results. The forecast combined profits for BP, Shell, along with US heavyweights Chevron and ExxonMobil, and France’s TotalEnergies would equate to more than £5,000 a second. US heavyweight Chevron has already announced record annual profits of £28.6billion while ExxonMobil reported full-year earnings of £45.2billion.

High street loses fashion retailer M&Co with almost 200 stores set to close,"M&Co are set to shut 170 high street stores after entering administration, with 1,910 jobs at riskHigh street fashion retailer M&Co is set to close 170 of its stores, putting 1,910 jobs at risk. The brand has been bought by Yours Clothing, which also owns clothing lines BadRhino, Long Tall Sally, and Bump It Up Maternity. Drapers has confirmed the sale of the business, with Teneo handling the administration. A Teneo spokesman confirmed that the brand and intellectual property of M&Co will now be owned by Yours Clothing.  However, the stores have not been included in the sale, with 1,910 jobs at risk, according to an inside source, reported The Sun. If the company was to go into liquidation, stores may disappear off the high street within weeks, but the process could take up to two months.   The company fell into administration in December last year, with Teneo putting the business up for sale at auction. Other high street stores, such as Frasers, Next or Marks & Spencers have not been interested in purchasing the brand, alongside Hilco Capital, who previously financed M&Co in 2020. In terms of obtaining a refund while a business is in administration, for items purchased online, M&Co should provide a full cash refund as long as the item is in its original condition. Customers can use a free Royal Mail courier service to return the item. Should a consumer want to return an item purchased online in store, M&Co can only issue gift cards or exchanges. The same goes for items purchased in store. It is best advised that anyone with a gift card should use it sooner rather than later, as when a company enters administration, the administrators can stop accepting gift cards at any point.  If this is the case, consumers should register a claim with the administrators for the value of the card. It may be possible that the money may not be returned if other creditors are owed money. Alongside M&Co, it has recently been announced that stationery brand, Paperchase, has also gone into administration, after failing to find a buyer.  The stores have since been closed, with Tesco opting to purchase the rights to the brand.  The supermarket giant will sell Paperchase items in stores. Alongside retailers, high-street food outlets, including Byron Burger, Las Iguanas, Café Rouge and Bella Italia have all entered administration.

O2 issues warning over phone call and text that could drain your bank account,"The fraudsters try to lure you in by claiming you’re eligible for 30% or more off your bill before sending a text with a one-time passcode and asking you to read it back to them - but don't do thisO2 customers have been urged to be aware of scammers who are trying to steal personal details by offering bogus “discounts” on your phone bill. The fraudsters try to lure you in by calling you up and claiming you’re eligible for 30% or more off your bill. They then send you a text with a one-time passcode and ask that you read it back to them - but don’t do this. O2 has confirmed this is a scam and it would never ask you to read back a one-time passcode. The text with the passcode will come from an O2 UK number - which makes it harder to see this is a scam - as the fraudster has used the O2 website to claim you have forgotten your login details. The scammer will then use the passcode you’ve given them over the phone to gain access to your account.   If a fraudster gets hold of this code, they may be able to order a new phone in your name. You could then end up being charged for the device until you can report it as fraud, and by that point the fraudster has the handset. In the text message you receive before the code arrives, it states: “If someone’s calling you and asking for a code, please end the call because they DO NOT work from O2.” You should only use a one-time passcode that you’ve requested yourself - for example, if you’ve forgotten the password to your online account.  I’ve had three of these calls in the last week - so be aware of this type of scam doing the rounds.   Liam Rawsthorne, Head of Fraud at Virgin Media O2 said: “At Virgin Media O2, we’re constantly investing to help better protect our customers from scams but unfortunately, we know that full-time fraudsters are always looking for new ways to target our customers.   “If you receive a call offering a deal or significant discount on your mobile contract that sounds too good to be true, it probably is – so taking a moment to pause is always the best course of action.   “Our staff will never pressure you into accepting a deal right then and there or call you to ask for your one-time passcode over the phone so never share it with an unexpected caller, no matter how legitimate they seem.  “When in doubt, always clam up, hang up and call us back. Our offers will never have a five-minute time limit, so you won’t miss out on any genuine deals – but you might just swerve the scammers.” What to do if you think you've been scammed If you think you've been called by a scammer, never reveal your personal details. Hang up immediately and search for the contact details online of the place you're supposedly being called from. Never call back the number provided by the caller. If you think a scammer has got hold of your bank details, contact your bank straight away. You can call the 159 hotline, which will connect you to your bank. You should also change any passwords that may have been compromised. Make sure you report scams and fraud to Action Fraud by calling 0300 123 2040, or through the Action Fraud website. If you're in Scotland, report a scam through Advice Direct Scotland on 0808 164 6000 or on the Advice Direct Scotland website.  You can also report scams to Police Scotland on 101.

Martin Lewis warns millions of Brits could have savings over £1000 but don't know it,"Martin Lewis told viewers that if they were born between September 1 2002 and January 2 2011, or have a child who was, they could have cash saved into a Child Trust Fund (CTF)Martin Lewis warned that millions in the UK aged between 12 and 20 years could have more than £1,000 lying in a ""dormant"" savings account.  The Money Saving Expert highlighted the problem in his recent Martin Lewis Money Show episode and urged people to investigate. He told his viewers that if they were born between September 1 2002 and January 2 2011, or have a child who was, they could have cash saved into a Child Trust Fund (CTF).  Child Trust Funds were tax-free savings accounts for children born in this time frame and were introduced to encourage parents to save for their child's future.  They are locked until the child turns 18 years old, and after this, they are able to access the money.   The UK Government provided an initial deposit of at least £250 to start every account, or £500 if your family were on a low income up until July 2010. Plus a further £250 or £500 if the child turned seven before that date. Between August 1 2010 and January 2 2011, the second payment was scrapped while the initial payment ranged from £50 to £500.  Either way, the Money Saving Expert said every account has a sum of money sitting in it. He said: ""So there are 6.3million of these and hundreds of thousands have lost track and on average a child trust fund is worth around £2,100.  ""But I'm saying around £1000 because I think if you don't know you've got it and you've not added anything to it, you probably haven't managed it as well as it could be so it's probably got less in it."" How to find your Child Trust Fund Martin went on to explain how to check if you have a Child Trust Fund, where it is and how to access it. If you already know who your Child Trust Fund provider is, you can contact them directly. This might be a bank, building society or other savings provider. If the trust fund is lost or you are unsure where it is, all you need to do is visit GOV.UK, search Child Trust Funds and complete an online form to find out where the Child Trust Fund is held.  Parents can do it for those under 18 years and you will need your Government Gateway and National Insurance number, however, if you're 16 years old you can do it yourself.  If a parent or guardian was not able to set up an account for their child, HMRC opened a savings account on the child’s behalf. What to do once you have found it Teenagers aged 16 or over can take control of their own Child Trust Fund if they wish, although the funds can only be withdrawn once they turn 18 years old. Where children have a Child Trust Fund, families can still pay in up to £9,000 a year tax-free. The account matures once the child turns 18 years old and no further money can be deposited. They can either withdraw the funds from the matured Child Trust Fund account or reinvest them into another savings account such as an ISA.   Martin's co-host Angellica Bell then shared the story of one viewer called Karen who was encouraged by the Money Saving Expert to go in search of her child's trust fund. She said: ""Karen says she forgot that this had been taken out and her 18-year-old recently got his and cashed it and got £1174. ""It was so easy to find and receive the money within a week.""

Why you should think twice before ordering drinks on tab - it could put your cash at risk,"Consumer rights expert Martyn James runs through the simple money mistakes that we're probably all guilty of having made at least once or twice in our lives... and how to avoid themLife is full of risk. Every day, we take calculated risks to save time and energy that could end up costing us far more in the long run when things go wrong. Cutting corners can be fraught with difficulty and silly in retrospect.  Who hasn’t knocked over a plate or glass when stretching a limb out to nudge it closer, rather than just sitting up and doing things properly?! But taking risks can leave you with more than a sense of foolishness. They can be exceptionally expensive. Compare the Market recently carried out research that revealed one in ten people hide their house keys under the doormat. And yes, criminals are wise to the plant pot trick or that loose brick you think that no one has noticed. This matters, of course, because if your home is burgled and you’ve left the key somewhere pretty obvious, your insurance claim could be turned down. So let’s take a look at some of the other risks we take that make our lives a tiny bit easier, but could cost us big time.    Hiding the house keys  The same research on hiding house keys found that 38% of people had lost their keys in the last year. So not being able to get in to your home is an understandable concern for most of us. However, if you have a cunning plan to gain access should something go wrong, then you’ll need to run it past your insurer. Leaving a sneaky window ajar on an upper level of your property is another common (and somewhat dangerous) measure people use to avoid getting locked out. But this too can involve your insurance claims being invalidated if you get burgled. Thieves often ""case out"" properties, looking for things like accessible unlocked windows, back doors with pickable locks and security alarms that have not been turned on. Your home insurance policy will have a number of clauses about security. For example, if you’ve got an alarm, you’ll need to turn it on whenever you are out of the property or face a dismissed or reduced claim. It’s also worthwhile looking at the rules around locks, as many policies specify the type of locks you will need to have on doors and windows. So don’t assume yours will meet modern standards. The jury is currently out about ""key safes"" - the little boxes with security codes attached to your home. This can sometimes indicate a property is being used for regular short lets, through firms like Airbnb – which could increase your premiums significantly. There are also lots of types of key safe so you’ll need to speak to your insurer about the type of safe you are potentially buying and how and where it will be affixed to your property.    ‘Keys in car’ thefts  Speaking of keys, one of the most expensive time-saving mistakes people make is leaving the key in the car while it’s defrosting. When it gets colder, defrosting the car can be a drag when you’re rushing to get to work or take the kids to school. There are lots of different techniques when it comes to clearing off the snow or frost. However, one of the most popular methods is to slip the keys in the ignition – or unlock and engage for a hi-tech vehicle - and leave the engine running while watching the car through the window. Unfortunately, this is often followed by the sound of the car being driven off by an opportunistic car thief. Every winter, countless people heating up their car find out the hard way just how quickly it can get stolen. ""Keys in car"" thefts occur outside the home, shops, post boxes, by cash machines, even at petrol stations. And when it comes to making an insurance claim, you might find you get a frosty response. All isn’t lost though. While most insurers include clauses in their contracts about leaving your car unattended with the keys in (or even open) you can still appeal if your claim is turned down. If you genuinely didn’t unlock the vehicle, it’s on the insurer to prove that the car was left unlocked, so if the way the thief gained access is inconclusive, make a complaint. It’s been repeatedly proven that even the most modern car locking systems can be outwitted by enterprising robbers.   Card share carnage  There have been quite a few stories in the news lately about people who have been defrauded after their phone or card has been stolen and the thieves have got in to their accounts. While much has been made of how ""hackable"" mobile phone face recognition is - not very, but it can happen - this ignores the main issue. Security measures are only as safe as the weakest link – and that’s us. I’ve helped sort out numerous complaints over the years about whether people have allowed their bank or credit card accounts to be accessed due to carelessness (or ""gross negligence"" as many account T&Cs call it). Thieves crack the code by ""shoulder surfing"" – the surprisingly low-fi technique of watching you put in your card PIN when you pay for goods or when you enter your phone password. This often happens in bars when drinks have been consumed and natural light problems mean face ID doesn’t work so you have to put your phone PIN in. Many of these complaints can be resolved in your favour, if your card provider takes a pragmatic look at the situation. However, if you’ve shared your card PIN with someone, given it to them briefly or been careless, it could cost you a great deal. If you give your card to a mate, you’ve breached the conditions of the account. There are no ""exceptional circumstances"" – if the bank or card provider ascertain that you gave the card or PIN to someone else, chances are you’ll have to pay for any subsequent fraud that occurs, even if a thief pinched the card. Carelessness is tricky to define, but if you’ve not hidden your PIN when you made purchase, you could also be liable. I once dealt with a case where a man lost £20,000 after his card was mis-used in a ""gentleman’s club"". While it was clear that the transactions were deeply questionable, he admitted to using the card to buy rounds of drinks early in the night and later in the evening too.  This meant that he had allowed the card to leave his side and the number be compromised. Which meant he lost the whole sum when his complaint was turned down.  In theory, this applies if you leave your card behind a bar on a tab – so buy drinks as you go in future.   Password problems  Do you regularly get updates informing you that your passwords have been compromised in a data leak? Let’s be honest, we all do – and sometimes changing all of your passwords (and remembering the new ones) can be a total drag. But it’s absolutely worth changing your passwords regularly, even without businesses allowing your data to be compromised. My fellow TV expert and technology specialist, David McClelland, has the following tips for anyone who feels a little lost when knowing how to keep on top of all things password-related.  Tempting though it is, don’t reuse the same password for different online accounts – thieves will try different variations of old passwords, so sticking a different number isn’t going to give you sufficient protection. Make sure every account is secured using a unique, difficult-to-guess passphrase. Not sure how to do this? Use a trustworthy ""password manager"" app. These work like ""digital safes"" and remember your details so you don’t have to. They even create complicated passwords on your behalf. Turn on ""multi-factor authentication"" for online accounts that support it as well as a username and password, you’ll be sent a code to your mobile or asked to authenticate using an app on your phone.  If you’re a tech-phobe, then why not consider having different passwords for different sectors, like banking, shopping, subscriptions, utilities and leisure? That way if one gets compromised, you don’t have to change everything.   Check your email  Thieves and fraudsters are incredibly creative. So keep on top of all the latest scams and share your tips with friends and family to help them spot a scam too. My scams guides are all on the Mirror online – and I’ll be writing new ones in the coming weeks too. One new development in fraud that caught me by surprise is email hijacking. While thieves seeking to access your email accounts is nothing new, what’s worrying is what they are doing when they gain access. In the past, thieves have sent fake emails from hacked accounts asking friends, colleagues or family members to send money or share personal details. However, now it would seem that they are also trawling your emails to find details that could unlock other accounts or open fake accounts. So take a deep breath and type in ""password"" or ""passport"" in to your email address search bars. If you’ve emailed any of these details to yourself in the past, you’ll be alarmed by how quickly this information comes up. Delete them all and consider saving personal information in folders with non-distinct titles. Remember a search of email content can bring up any mention of key words in the main text, not just the email title.   That sinking feeling  Just because you’ve made a silly mistake, that doesn’t mean you should give up on seeing any cash back. Speak to insurers, banks and other businesses, explaining the circumstances of the situation. You might get lucky, or more frequently, the business might have a compromise agreement too that could involve a partial payment.

"Full list of shops, pubs and banks closing this year from Paperchase to Wetherspoon","We reveal the full list of high street shops, retailers and pubs closing in 2023, as the high street takes a massive hit and thousands of jobs lie at risk through these changesThe high street has taken a massive hit in recent years, with scores of household names having disappeared forever.  In a grim prediction, another 15,000 stores are expected to close in 2023, alongside a further 128,000 job losses, according to the Centre for Retail Research. From Wetherspoon to Paperchase high street banks including Barclays and HSBC, it has not been an easy start of the year for some companies in terms of closures. Here, we round up all the shops, banks and pubs that will shut up stores forever this year.  Paperchase  Card and stationery retailer Paperchase collapsed into administration last week, putting 820 jobs and 106 stores at risk. Tesco has purchased the Paperchase brand and intellectual property - although the buyout does not include the physical stores. It means the collapse of the chain is likely to result stores closing and hundreds of jobs being lost. Paperchase appointed insolvency firm Begbies Traynor as administrators, who said: ""On January 31 2023 Mark Fry, Kirstie Provan and Gary Shankland, of Begbies Traynor, were appointed as Joint Administrators of Aspen Phoenix Newco Limited, which trades as Paperchase. ""Unfortunately, despite a comprehensive sales process, no viable offers were received for the Company, or its business and assets, on a going concern basis. ""However, this sale reflects the interest in the well-known and established brand and will enable the brand to continue in Tesco stores across the UK.""  Wetherspoon Wetherspoon announced that it is selling 35 pubs across the UK, having already sold off 11 boozers. Chairman Tim Martin said that a decision was made to sell off the pubs due to rising food and energy costs and lack of staff. The 35 pubs up for sale are in city centres across England and Scotland, as all the venues are being considered for sale individually, in small packages, or as a portfolio. However, while the pubs are on the market, the good news for punters is that they will remain open and continue to trade as Wetherspoon sites until they are sold. For the full list of pubs being open, click here.  Stonegate Stonegate, which is behind brands such as Slug and Lettuce and Be At One, is reportedly set to sell off 1,000 of its pubs. The pub giant is said to be looking to scale back after acquiring a whopping £2.6 billion debt pile, according to Bloomberg. The company has said they are ""not making any comment on the story"" but its chairman Ian Payne admitted their ""biggest concern"" right now is the cost of energy. He said in an interview: “The biggest concern is energy. “We know what we’re going to pay in February and March, but we still don’t know what we’re going to pay beyond that.”  H&M M&S is closing a further two UK shops in Hartlepool and the Isle of Wight. This comes following the closures of two of its branches in Burton and Maidenhead. The high-street fashion retailer has blamed a ""rapid change in customer behaviour"", for its closures. Despite this, it has not confirmed whether any more stores have been earmarked for closure too. The full H&M statement reads: ""During the last few years, we have seen a rapid change in customer behaviour that we cannot ignore. ""We continuously need to evaluate and develop our business to meet our customer’s needs and offer the best possible shopping experience, whether it’s online or in our physical stores. ""Our ambition is to continue investing in our customers, open new stores where we see opportunities and develop our digital channels. ""We continuously evaluate how we should invest in stores and sometimes decisions must be made to enable long-term growth. This means that we sometimes need to close stores.""  Banks Banks have been disappearing from the high street as as more people use online services to manage their money. In one of the latest announcements, HSBC confirmed it would shut 114 banks - around a quarter of its total sites - in 2023. Meanwhile, NatWest has said that it has scheduled 66 banks across the UK to shut their doors forever, with 16 having closed already this month. And Lloyds is closing a further 36 banks in total this year, which includes 13 that shut in January. Barclays will shut 41 sites in 2023, while Halifax will do the same for 23 branches in total. Santander will close five banks, Nationwide will close two and TSB has just announced it will shut nine sites. For the full list of banks closing, click here.  Argos Argos in January announced plans that it will be closing all of its stores in the Republic of Ireland by the end of June this year. The retailer has 34 stores across Ireland and employs roughly 580 staff members. It is worth noting that the stores in Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales are set to be unaffected by the announcement. Argos said it arrived at the decision to leave Ireland following a long period of ""careful consideration"" and a ""thorough review"" of its business and operations in the country. Andy McClelland, Operations Manager at Argos Ireland said: “We understand this is difficult news for our customers and colleagues. As with any major change to our business, we have not made this decision lightly and we are doing everything we can to support those impacted. ""On behalf of everyone at Argos, I would like to thank our colleagues, customers, suppliers and partners for their support to our business.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/full-list-shops-pubs-banks-29097041
Martin Lewis urges people to claim 'massive' state pension top-up - see if you can,"On a recent episode of the Martin Lewis Money Show, Martin Lewis explained what Specified Adult Childcare Credits were and how you could benefit from themMartin Lewis shared how grandparents could claim a “little-known” credit which could add thousands of pounds to their state pension payments.  The Money Saving Expert has shared details on how older Brits, who are currently looking after grandchildren or have done so at any point since 2011, can boost their state pension pots. On a recent episode of the Martin Lewis Money Show, Martin Lewis explained what Specified Adult Childcare Credits were and how you could benefit from them.  Martin shared with his viewers how state pension payments can be boosted by moving the National Insurance credit attached to Child Benefit from the Child Benefit recipient to another family member.   However, this family member has to be providing care for a related child under the age of 12 years, or 17 if they have a disability.  You are allowed to transfer them if the child’s parent, or main carer, does not need the National Insurance credits which come from their claim to child benefit. However, the Money Saving Expert shared how parents also benefit from this too.  He explained that the parent won’t miss out because as long as they are working and earning enough, they will get National Insurance credits through their employment.  He added: “If you’ve got gaps in your National Insurance, it can massively boost your state pension once you get into retirement by thousands of pounds over the rest of your life.”  Martin warned that you cannot get the credits if you’re already at State Pension age.  However, he explained: “If you are at state pension age and you don’t get the full pension and you did childcare before you hit State Pension age then you can backdate it.” You can backdate a claim until 2011 which means those who have provided some form of care for younger family members over the last decade can get this pension boost.  Specifically, Martin highlighted that if your usual childcare arrangements changed during the Covid-19 pandemic, for example, you cared for a child by phone or video calls, you can still apply for credits for the 2019 to 2020 and the 2020 to 2021 tax years. One viewer called Rosemary contacted the Martin Money Show to share her success story of boosting her state pension payments. Rosemary wrote: “I was alerted to this a few years ago by you. I managed to get credits for three full years which is enough to give me a full state pension, due to start in a couple of weeks. “The process was quite simple and confirmation quite quick. Well worth the bit of effort. Thanks.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/martin-lewis-urges-people-claim-29124805
Check if you’re missing out on extra cold weather cash worth up to £600,"The majority of the Government's support schemes are still going and those that are not will still allow you to raise a claim until the end of March soThere are still a few more weeks until warmer weather finally arrives. If you need some extra help to cover the cost of your energy bills, there are several schemes which could give you financial support this winter. The majority of these schemes, which are run by the UK Government, are still running now - and if you're eligible you can put in a claim. Mirror Money has compiled a full list of the support which could be available to you along with the eligibility criteria for each, and how much you potentially could get.    Cold Weather Payments - £25 Cold Weather Payments, worth £25, are normally paid automatically by the DWP when your town or city experiences, or is forecast to experience, temperatures zero degrees and under for seven consecutive days. The scheme runs from November 1 to March 31 in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, and to be eligible you must claim the following benefits:  Pension Credit Income Support (if you have any of the following: disability or pensioner premium, a child who is disabled, Child Tax Credit that includes a disability or severe disability element or a child under five living with you) Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance (if you have any of the following: disability or pensioner premium, a child who is disabled, Child Tax Credit that includes a disability or severe disability element or a child under five living with you) Income-related Employment and Support Allowance (if you have any of the following: severe or enhanced disability premium, a pensioner premium, a child who is disabled, Child Tax Credit that includes a disability or severe disability element or a child under five living with you) Universal Credit (if you are not employed or self-employed, and you have a health condition or disability and have limited capability for work, or you have a child under five living with you) Support for Mortgage Interest (if you have any of the following: severe or enhanced disability premium, a pensioner premium, a child who is disabled, Child Tax Credit that includes a disability or severe disability element or a child under five living with you)  As we've mentioned above, you should be paid automatically - but there are some circumstances where you won't. You will need to contact your Jobcentre Plus if you claim Income Support, Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance or Income-related Employment and Support Allowance and:  You've had a baby A child under five has come to live with you  Some areas experienced several stints of freezing weather over the last few months and could be entitled to receive three payments worth £75.  You can check if your area was eligible for the £25 payment using the Government's online postcode checker.  Scotland has got rid of the Cold Weather Payment and replaced it with a new winter heating payment, and unlike the cold weather payment, the Scottish payment does not depend on how cold the temperature gets. It’s a yearly payment of £50 that’s paid automatically to those who are eligible on certain benefits.  Winter fuel payments - £600 Winter Fuel Payments are an annual one-off sum worth between £100 and £300 for households that include someone born on or before 25 September 1956. The amount you will receive is dependent on your specific circumstances such as if you live alone or with someone or claim certain benefits. This year, eligible households are being paid the £300 Pensioner Cost of Living payment on top of the Winter Fuel Payment, which has meant some homes have received up to £600. Your Winter Fuel Payment will normally be smaller if you live in a care home or nursing home and don't get one of the following benefits:  Pension Credit Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance Income-related Employment and Support Allowance  You won't get a Winter Fuel Payment at all if you live in a care home or nursing home and you don't get any of these benefits. You can see how much you're likely to get here. The deadline for you to make a claim for winter is March 31 2023. Warm Home Discount - £150 The Warm Home Discount is a one-off payment of £150 taken off your electricity bill or added to your prepayment meter. You should get the payment automatically if you live in England and Wales and you, or your partner, receive the Guarantee Credit portion of Pension Credit. You may also get the Warm Home Discount if you are on a low income, claiming certain benefits and have high energy costs. If you live in Scotland, you'll need to apply if you're part of the group who is eligible through claiming benefits or low income. The qualifying means-tested benefits are:  Housing Benefit Income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) Income Support ""Savings Credit"" part of Pension Credit Universal Credit  You could also qualify if your household income falls below a certain threshold and you get:  Child Tax Credit Working Tax Credit  Suppliers can choose to offer the discount to more customers. If you haven't received the money and you think you're eligible, call the Warm Home Discount helpline on 0800 107 8002.  Energy bill rebate - £134 Next month is the last month you will receive the energy bill rebate, which overall will have given you £400 off your energy bills since October last year.  Every household in the UK is set to receive another £67 discount on their energy bill in February and then again in March totalling a discount of £134. The scheme reaches its completion in March after having been launched in October last year, and the government has confirmed that it will not be extended.  If you pay your bills by direct debit you will receive the discount automatically – either as a deduction to your monthly payments or as a refund to your bank account. The discount is provided monthly, regardless of whether you pay bills monthly or quarterly or have an associated payment card. Smart prepayment meter customers will also receive the discount automatically and prepay customers are sent discount vouchers by text, email or post that they will need to redeem. A small number of suppliers are returning the money to customers’ bank accounts instead. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/check-youre-missing-out-extra-29087402
Poundstretcher announces plan to open 50 new stores - and workers get 10% pay rise,"Poundstretcher has opened around 30 sites across the UK in the last year and currently has over 350 shops nationwide with over 6,000 employeesPoundstretcher has announced its plan to open 50 new sites across the UK before the end of the year. The popular discount chain believes the new store openings could generate a further 2,000 jobs over the next five years. The discount chain opened 30 locations across the UK last year and currently has over 350 shops nationwide with over 6,000 employees.  Poundstretcher has not shared a full list of where it plans to open its new sites however, one of its new shops has already opened in Scotland last week. This new location based in Galashiels opened on January 28 offering customers 50% off selected lines.   The discount store stated that its profitability has grown since 2020 and that it is now looking towards a ""profitable future"" that will drive sales, profits and number of stores growth.   Alongside this news, Poundstretcher also announced it was to give its staff a pay rise of 10% from April 1 2023.  All members of staff who have worked for the business for at least one year will be eligible for the increase, which includes more than 70% of its workforce, around 4,000 staff, and the majority of its customer-facing employees.  On this announcement, the owner of Poundstretcher Aziz Tayub said: ""“This 10% pay raise will make a real difference in this current climate to the majority of our employees who are committed to servicing our customers and growing our business in the current economic climate.”  This is the second time in the last 12 months that the chain has given its staff a wage rise of 10%.  Last year it implemented a salary hike to reward staff for their hard work post-pandemic and for the positive turnaround of its profits.  In July 2020, Poundstretcher entered into a Compulsory Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) to find a way of offloading high rent stores.  In November last year, it chain announced it had exited the two-year CVA after repaying its creditors at a rate of 12p to the pound. Poundstretcher has now paid off around £13 million of what it owed. Poundstretcher was established over 40 years ago in 1981 and specialises in selling a variety of discount products across food, toiletries, garden essentials and home-ware brands.

Brits struggling with debt could save thousands in 'unfair' fees thanks to new rules,"Consumers who enter a debt solution which is not right for them can face dire consequences and could force them to stay in debt for much longerA major change to debt rules has been put forward which could save those struggling thousands of pounds in ""unfair"" fees.  The proposals by the financial regulator would ban debt packager firms from receiving referral fees from debt solution providers. Debt packagers are ""regulated"" providers of debt advice, who refer people to debt solution providers. Currently, these companies can take a referral fee for passing on a customer to another debt solutions advisor and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) wants to ban this practice.  The FCA, which keeps an eye on the financial services industry in the UK, began its discussions on a ban in November 2021 and is pushing on with another consultation which will close in March this year.  The FCA explained how the debt packager firms charge these fees when those seeking debt advice are referred to an insolvency practitioner for an individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) or a protected trust deed (PTD).   An IVA is an agreement between you and the people you owe money to, your creditors, to pay all or part of your debts and you agree to make regular payments to the insolvency practitioner, who then splits the money between your creditors. A protected trust deed is where you agree to pay a regular amount of money towards your debts and at the end of a fixed time, the rest of your debts will be written off.  The FCA say that these fees are usually much higher than the fees which are charged when the person in debt is referred to a government scheme such as a debt relief order.  Consumers who enter a debt solution which is not right for them can face dire consequences.  The regulator said going into an IVA unnecessarily could cost you almost £5,000 and could mean you spend an extra five years paying off your debt before becoming debt-free. Some 54,000 people sought advice from a debt packager in the year to March 2020, according to estimates. Sheldon Mills, executive director of consumers and competition at the FCA, said: “Many people are facing pressures on their finances due to the rising the cost of living, so it’s crucial they get good quality debt advice. “Unsuitable or poor advice can really harm people’s financial lives. We want to stop this harm by removing the conflict of interest between firms giving advice in the customer’s best interest and recommending an option that makes firms more money.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/brits-struggling-debt-could-save-29123890
Aldi named UK’s cheapest supermarket with up to £26 in savings on a single shop,"Aldi has been named as the UK's cheapest supermarket during the month of January where a single shop could see a saving of £26 compared to the most expensive, according to consumer watchdog WhichBrits looking for the cheapest supermarket during the cost of living crisis have been told they could save £26 on a single shop by going to Aldi, according to consumer watchdog Which. Discounter Aldi in January came out the cheapest among eight of the UK's largest supermarkets for typical items during a shopping trip.  The consumer champion's analysis, which involves comparing the prices of a shop consisting of 45 popular groceries at eight of the UK's biggest supermarkets, is done on a monthly basis.   The cheapest supermarket was Aldi, where the basket of goods was £82.03 on average while the same shop at Waitrose was £107.71 on average, a difference of £25.68.   Which? also compared the cost of a larger trolley of 144 items.    These items included a larger number of branded items, such as Andrex toilet paper and Cathedral City cheese, and did not include discounter supermarkets Aldi and Lidl, given that they do not always stock some of these products.   Asda was the cheapest for this larger trolley of groceries, continuing its winning streak, which started in January, 2020, as the most economical of the bigger supermarket chains. It cost £363.29 on average for this shop, beating the next cheapest, Sainsbury's (£375.84), by £12.55.  Waitrose was an eye-watering £45.43 more expensive than Asda, coming in at £408.72, on average, for the trolley of comparable goods. This latest pricing analysis from Which? demonstrates that shoppers can make considerable savings on their grocery budget depending on where they buy their food. But despite more budget ranges and prices at the discounters, Which? believes supermarkets must do more to help their customers.   Which? recently launched its Affordable Food For All campaign, calling on supermarkets to provide the support people around the country desperately need in order to keep food on the table during the ongoing cost of living crisis. Reena Sewraz, Which? Retail Editor, said: ""Nobody wants to pay over the odds for their weekly food shop, especially as the cost of living crisis stretches household budgets for millions of people. ""Our findings show that while prices are going up, some supermarkets are significantly more expensive than others. As well as choosing a supermarket that is cheap overall, other ways to save include swapping from branded to supermarket own-brand products, sticking to a shopping list, and resisting the temptation to pick up special offers you may not need.""

Inside rapist cop David Carrick's house of horrors where victims were attacked,"David Carrick, 48, was unmasked as one of Britain's most prolific sex offenders after he admitted to 24 counts of rape as well as charges of sexual assault, controlling and coercive behaviour and false imprisonmentThese images show serial police rapist David Carrick's lair where he kept victims in the cupboard and had cameras installed to watch them. Carrick, 48, was unmasked as one of Britain's most prolific sex offenders after he admitted to 24 counts of rape as well as charges of sexual assault, controlling and coercive behaviour and false imprisonment. He sentencing is being concluded today. Carrick's crimes were all carried out while serving with the force - he guarded sites including embassies and the Houses of Parliament, and completed training courses, including one on domestic abuse in 2005. Images released yesterday showed a tiny cupboard under the stairs where victims said they were locked under there naked.   Prosecutor Tom Little KC told Southwark Crown Court yesterday how Carrick shut one of his victims in a small cupboard as a punishment while ""whistling at her as if she was a dog"". Continuing his opening, he said: ""If (the victim) upset the defendant, she would be punished, sometimes by acts of violence and on other occasions, she was shut in a small cupboard under the stairs. ""This occurred on a significant number of occasions.  ""On one occasion she asked to get out as she was having a panic attack. He would not let her out. ""They did not communicate whilst she was sat in the cupboard - he would stand outside and whistle at her as if she was a dog."" Other images show multiple cameras installed in the house as the victim said he watched them while he was out. One said he would use the cameras to control when she slept and also shouted insults from the microphone while he was on duty.  Yesterday, the court heard extremely distressing details of Carrick's campaign of abuse against the victims. One victim said she felt she had ""encountered evil"" that night Carrick attacked her and feared she was going to be killed. Carrick told one of his victims he was “the safest person that she could be with” before he raped her.  Mr Little said Carrick held a black handgun to a victim’s head before telling her “you are not going” as he raped her.  Other women said they feared they would not be believed if they reported Carrick and no longer trusted the police after what he had done to them.  Serial rapist Carrick told one victim he would be the “last thing she saw” as he put his hands around her throat. One victim was raped by Carrick while her parents slept in the tent next to them on a camping trip, Mr Little said. After Carrick pleaded guilty it later emerged that the Met was informed of nine incidents - including allegations of rape, domestic violence and harassment - between 2000 and 2021. Carrick faces no criminal sanctions or misconduct findings.  Alisdair Williamson KC, defending, said Carrick ""accepts fully responsibility for what he has done"" and that it is likely any life sentence will ""bring him close to, if not to, the close of his natural life"". Police chiefs across England and Wales have since been asked to have all officers checked against national police databases by the end of March. Carrick, who served in the Army before joining the Met, admitted 49 criminal charges, but some of the attacks are multiple incident counts, meaning they relate to more than 80 sexual offences, including at least 48 rapes against 12 women. He denied a further count of rape in September 2020 relating to a 13th woman, whose allegation triggered the investigation, and the Crown Prosecution Service decided it was not in the public interest to proceed to trial on the charge.  The Met was forced to apologise and admit Carrick should have been rooted out earlier after it emerged he came to police attention over nine incidents - including allegations of rape, domestic violence and harassment - between 2000 and 2021, with all but one of the incidents relating to his behaviour towards women. Carrick faced no criminal sanctions or misconduct findings and police chiefs across England and Wales have since been asked to have all officers checked against national police databases by the end of March. He was finally sacked from the force last month after pleading guilty and being unmasked as one of the country's most prolific sex offenders. Carrick's crimes are set to form part of the independent inquiry looking at the murder of Sarah Everard, who was raped and strangled by then-serving Met officer Wayne Couzens in March 2021. *For confidential support, call the 24-hour National Domestic Abuse Freephone Helpline on 0808 2000 247 or visit womensaid.co.uk Furthermore, Rape Crisis 24/7 helpline can be contacted at 0808 500 2222, Victim Support 24/7 helpline is on 0808 168 9111, Survivors UK (male victims) can be reached 0203 598 3898, Survivors Trust helpline is on 08088 010818 ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/inside-serial-rapist-cop-david-29152524
Epsom College headteacher 'made distressed call before husband killed her and daughter',"Epsom College headteacher Emma Pattison and her daughter Lettie, were believed to be killed by husband George, before he killed himself at their home within the private school's grounds in SurreyThe headteacher of Epsom College and her seven-year-old daughter were reportedly killed in a double-murder suicide by her husband, after she made a desperate call to family. Emma Pattison, 45, her daughter Lettie and her husband George, 39, were all found dead at their home within the private school's grounds in Surrey, in the early hours of Sunday morning.  A neighbour, who is said to have heard gunshots, raised the alarm and just hours earlier, a distressed Mrs Pattison is said to have made a phone call to family members. Surrey Police has confirmed a firearm was found at the scene. It was licensed and registered to George Pattison. Officers also told reporters they visited Mr Pattison three days before the killings as he had notified them of a change of address. Surrey Police has said due to the short period of time between that contact and the three deaths, it has made a self-referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).   The BBC has reported that the father killed both his wife and daughter, before taking his own life. Sources claimed that a member of staff living nearby raised the alarm after hearing gunshots. Detective Chief Inspector Kimball Edey, Senior Investigating Officer on the case, said: “This is an incredibly traumatic incident and we are working around the clock to investigate and understand the exact circumstances which led to this point. “We understand the public concern and upset, and we will clarify what we can, when we can, while respecting the right to a level of privacy for the families of those who have lost their lives. “We are cooperating fully with the IOPC in relation to the referral we have made, and we await the outcome of its assessment of what further action may be required. Until this has been completed, we will be unable to provide further details on a number of matters.” Mrs Pattison had started her role as head in September and before Christmas had told a student podcast that the last few months had brought great change for her family with new jobs, a new school for Lettie and a new dog.  She was the school's first female headteacher and had told the podcast: ""In terms of transition it’s been a really big change for my family. We’ve moved house - we’ve bought a dog. ""I’ve got a new job, my husband has got a new job, that wasn’t meant to happen but it did and my daughter has started a new school so there’s been a lot of change for us as a family.” In the podcast episode, which had since been deleted, told of how she got into teaching after flicking through a copy of the Times Educational Supplement at a coffee shop. She said at the time she was on the graduate programme for Thomas Cook, a job she said she ""absolutely hated"". The head said she ""hadn't looked back"" since entering into teaching and told the student-presented podcast ""working with you people keeps you young, they keep you energised"". ""I am absolutely loving my time here so far,"" Mrs Pattison added. ""It's been very busy but absolutely wonderful. The college have been so supportive and everyone has been very, very welcoming."" The school, which was named independent school of the year in 2022, released a statement expressing their condolences and asking for privacy.  In a statement, the school said: ""It is with the deepest sadness and regret that we have to announce the news of the deaths of Emma Pattison, Head of Epsom College, her daughter Lettie, and her husband George. ""Our thoughts, condolences and sympathies are with their families at this tragic time."" ""The College is working with the police in what remains an ongoing investigation. ""We must now focus on the welfare and wellbeing of our pupils and staff, and work to ensure that they receive all the comfort, warmth and support required from the Epsom College community."" More than 850 boys and girls attend the £42,000-a-year school, which was founded in 1853, and lists BBC presenter Jeremy Vine and ex-MI6 spy chief Sir John Scarlett among its former pupils.  Inspector Jon Vale, Epsom and Ewell’s Borough Commander, said today: “I know this incident has caused upset and sent shockwaves through the local community.  ""Although we are confident that this incident was contained to one address, and there is no risk to the wider public I fully understand the concern this can and has caused members of our communities.  ""Therefore, the public can expect to see a heightened police presence in the local area in the coming days.  ""If you are concerned about anything at all I’d urge you to approach an officer and discuss your concerns with them. They will be ready and happy to help you however they can. “I would like to send my continued thanks to the school and our public for their understanding while the investigation progresses.” The deaths have been reported to the coroner.

"Woman, 18, scoops $48million after buying her very first lottery ticket","Juliette Lamour, from Ontario, Canada, bought the winning ticket on the advice of her grandad but quickly forgot about, only remembering when news started spreading that the winner was from her cityA teenager has won $48million (£30m) the first time she ever played the lottery. Juliette Lamour had just turned 18 and on the advice of her grandad bought her first ever ticket. The win made the young woman, from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, the youngest big lottery winner in Canadian history. ""I just turned 18 and my grandfather suggested I buy a lottery ticket for fun,"" explained Juliette during a winner’s celebration at the lottery HQ in Sault Ste. Marie. She continued: ""When I went to the store, I wasn’t sure what to ask for because I had never bought a ticket before, so I called my dad who told me to buy a LOTTO 6/49 Quick Pick.  ""I still can’t believe I hit the GOLD BALL jackpot on my very first lottery ticket!""   After buying the ticket Juliette put it out her mind, until news started spreading that the winning ticket had been sold in her city. When she remembered she had a ticket, a coworker offered to check the ticket on his lottery app and when he scanned it, the words ‘Big Winner’ flashed up on screen. She said: ""My colleague fell to his knees in disbelief. He was yelling, in fact everyone was yelling that I won $48 million! I didn’t understand what was going on at first. I couldn’t process this news. We kind of made a scene in the store that day!"".  When she called her mum to try explain what had happened, she was so ecstatic that she didn't make any sense. Juliette continued: ""Because I was crying – happy tears – of course, my mom couldn’t understand what was going on. Thankfully my dad was able to piece together that I won the lottery jackpot! ""I knew I couldn’t focus on work and my boss told me I could go home, but my mom wanted me to stay and finish my shift! My colleagues called out ‘come and get her,’ and my parents eventually came to pick me up."" Winning such a huge sum can overwhelm people but luckily Juliette's dad is a financial planner.  In a statement the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation said: ""While there have been other 18-year-old lottery winners across Canada in recent years, no one has won as much as Juliette."" Despite the life-changing amount of money, the teenager's plans haven't changed. She still wants to study to become a doctor but now won't have to worry about getting into debt to achieve that. Juliette said:""I wanted to go to medical school before winning the lottery. Now I can pursue this dream without worrying about grants or loans.  ""As a member the Garden River First Nation community, I was eligible for educational assistance programs, but I no longer need those resources which means someone else in the community can benefit from that funding. ""I really want to come back to this area as a doctor so I can give back to my community,"" she said. She's pledged to finish school and then go with her parents travelling. She continued: ""While I am so excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, I feel comforted knowing I am surrounded by the grounding love of my family. They will be with me on every step of this incredible journey,"" Juliette said. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/woman-18-scoops-48million-after-29153039
Summer holiday warning as passports lost by the Home Office reach a five-year high,"The Home Office has reportedly advised that the 10-week deadline introduced during the pandemic would remain in place due to an “elevated” and “volatile” demand for passports Brits have been warned to allow 10 weeks for new passports if they are planning to travel abroad this summer.   Figures obtained by the Liberal Democrats through parliamentary questions show the number of passports lost by the Home Office has hit a five-year high.   The department has now reportedly advised that the 10-week deadline introduced during the pandemic would remain in place due to an “elevated” and “volatile” demand for travel documents.   Home Secretary Suella Braverman told MPs: “We expect elevated demand for passports throughout the year – and demand can be volatile – so customers should continue to allow 10 weeks.  ""I urge people to apply in good time and not at the last minute.""   The Liberal Democrat MP for Bath, Wera Hobhouse, called on the Home Office to ""step up and take decisive action"" amid what she described as ""endless travel chaos"".  She told the Telegraph: “These are new heights of incompetence for the Home Office. British travellers who urgently need new passports are being left high and dry by these endless delays.  “With more and more passports going missing each year, it’s no wonder people are fed up with this endless travel chaos. “The Home Office needs to step up and take decisive action before more people are let down and lose confidence in these services.” The publication of these figures comes amid a hike in passport fees – which came into effect last Thursday.  From February 2, the cost of applying for a new British passport rose from £75.50 to £82.50 for adults, and £49 to £53.50 for children. While postal applications for passports will increase from £85 to £93 for adults and £58.50 to £64 for children. The Government’s webpage said of the fee hike: “The new fees will help the Home Office move towards a system that meets its costs through those who use it, reducing reliance on funding from general taxation. “The Government does not make any profit from the cost of passport applications. “The fees will also contribute to the cost of processing passport applications, consular support overseas, including for lost or stolen passports, and the cost of processing British citizens at UK borders. “The increase will also help enable the Government to continue improving its services.” It is the first time in five years that the cost of applying for a passport has increased, the Home Office said, adding that the proposals are subject to parliamentary scrutiny.

Turkey Syria earthquake: Miracle baby born under rubble as both parents killed,"Painful footage shows the baby girl taking its first breath surrounded by destruction after its mother went into labour during the quake, in Jenderes, in the countryside of Afrin, northeast SyriaA miracle baby who was born under the rubble of collapsed buildings in Syria has devastatingly been made an orphan as her parents did not make it out alive. Painful footage showed the baby girl taking its first breath surrounded by destruction after her mother went into labour during the quake.  The mammoth rescue operation took place in Jenderes, in the countryside of Afrin, northeast Syria. But the parents of the child, displaced tragically did not survive the earthquake's impact. This was just one of thousands of rescue operations that unfolded as darkness, rain and cold enveloped the region of Turkey and Syria that was rocked by a powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake early Monday.    Little is known about the newborn baby and its now-deceased family, aside from reports they had already been displaced by Syria’s brutal war from Deir Ezzor to Afrin, some seven hours away. More than 5,000 people have now died and hundreds of buildings have been razed to the ground, in the aftermath of one of the deadliest natural disasters this century. The initial quake was followed on Monday afternoon, local time, by another with a 7.7 magnitude. Today, a third 5.7 earthquake struck eastern Turkey as rescuers were digging through rubble with their bare hands. In a news briefing, Vice President Fuat Oktay of Turkey called the earthquake the ""disaster of the century"" as the death toll reached 5,000.  “My grandson is one-and-a-half years old. Please help them, please... They were on the 12th floor,” Imran Bahur said to AP while weeping by her destroyed apartment building in the Turkish city of Adana. Dozens of countries have sent rescue teams to assist in the search, including the UK, but experts warned that the window for finding survivors was closing in.  Much of Syria still bears the scars of the conflict - with weak buildings, an economic crisis, multiple health crises and dwindling aid from international donors - so the war’s toll has also hindered relief efforts. Ali Hussein Rashid, a 49-year-old relief worker told the Mirror from Aleppo: ""People were all over the street at 3 am when it first hit. But we had no cherry pickers, no equipment, nothing to pick the people out of the rubble except our hands. It was shocking. It can’t be described. Over 50 buildings collapsed, with just five ambulances for the whole area.""   Wailing children, sirens and the crunching of rubble beneath footsteps could all be heard over the phone from the scene of Monday's earthquake.  Mr Rashid described scenes - flattened buildings and hospitals full of bodies - which looked heartbreakingly similar to residents of Aleppo who have faced 11 years of bombardment. ""I thought I was going to die. Last night when I heard the rumbles, I thought it was jets in the sky. I was looking for jets in the sky and thought they were targeting buildings like before”, Dr Osama Sallom, Aleppo site manager with the Syrian American Medical Society told the Mirror. While in Turkey, four people have been detained over ""provocative"" social media posts, with officers saying they found accounts that shared ""provocative posts aiming to create fear and panic.""  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan declared a week of national mourning and said: ""Everyone is putting their heart and soul into efforts although the winter season, cold weather and the earthquake happening during the night makes things more difficult."" Jasmine Khaled Kanjo, a 35-year-old teacher, from Aleppo pleaded to the Mirror: ""How can the people of Britain help us? We need your help."" The Syrian American Medical Society, which runs hospitals in northern Syria and southern Turkey, said in a statement that its facilities are “overwhelmed with patients filling the hallways” and called urgently for “trauma supplies and a comprehensive emergency response to save lives and treat the injured.”  There was a moment of hope amid the horror as Ghana international football player and ex-Chelsea player Christian Atsu was found alive on Tuesday after being buried under rubble in Turkey. But Jamal Balî, 35, an activist from Kobani in northern Syria said to the Mirror it was worse than bombs: ""You can try and hide and protect yourself in some houses or something, but there is no place to hide from an earthquake.  ""You could be in danger anywhere. Anything could collapse on you. It's not like you're facing an army or an enemy, you are under threat at any second."" The World Health Organisation has warned that death toll numbers are likely to increase as much as eight times. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/miracle-baby-girl-born-orphan-29151722
Struggling mum slapped with £100 parking fine despite proving she bought a valid ticket,"Rosie Welch, from Colchester, has been threatened with court action over a £100 fine after a firm claimed she failed to input all of her car registration for her 15-minute stayA mum has been ordered to pay a £100 fine despite paying to park her car. Rosie Welch, 41, paid £1.30 for an hour-long stay but returned after 15 minutes. Days later, she was shocked when she received a £100 parking charge notice from Euro Car Parks for failing to input all of her car registration number into the machine. Adamant she had input all of her number, Rosie sent proof to the firm but it claimed it was a 'breach of contract' and she has been told to pay up. Rosie, from Colchester, Essex, said: “I haven't got £100, I don't have that money.   “My ticket only has the first two letters of my number plate on it, so the company said it's a 'gross keying error', a breach of contract and I have to pay a £100 fine. ""There was nowhere on the parking machine which said you have to put your full registration number in and nothing on any of the signs in the car park. ""I can't prove I didn't put the whole thing in, but I could prove I had purchased a ticket for the same time my car was in the car park. ""I can only think the machine must have had a printer fault. “Despite paying for a short parking stay, we've been left with threatening letters talking about debt recovery and court proceedings. I have nowhere else to turn. ""I even took it to the Citizen's Advice Bureau and they said to write to my MP.   ""If it came to it and they took us to court, I would have to go to court as I can't physically pay it."" The firm agreed to reduce the fee to a £20 administration charge, but when Rosie decided to appeal that the fine reverted back to £100. Parking on Private Land Appeals (POPLA) has also rejected Rosie's appeal, and has told her that although she 'demonstrated the intention to make a valid payment', she didn't make one. A spokesman for POPLA said: ""While I appreciate the appellant has demonstrated the intention to make a valid payment, the fact remains they did not. ""By failing to enter the full and correct vehicle registration, the parking ticket is invalid for the appellant's vehicle to park."" Euro Car Parks have been contacted for a comment.

Sir Salman Rushdie struggles to write since knife attack left him blind in one eye,"Sir Salman Rushdie, 75, was left blind in one eye and with severe nerve damage in his left hand after an attack at a literary event in New York last year in which he was stabbedSir Salman Rushdie has spoken for the first time about the frenzied knife assault that came within ­millimetres of killing him. The author said the “colossal attack” last year has left him struggling to write again as he recovers from the trauma. The 75-year-old was left blind in one eye and with severe nerve damage in his left hand after being stabbed on stage at a literary event in New York last August. He has lost three stone and said he has had nightmares and, while he has “tried very hard not to adopt the role of a victim”, he suffers post-traumatic stress. He said: “I’ve found it very, very ­difficult to write. I sit down to write, and nothing happens. I write, but it’s a combination of blankness and junk, stuff that I write and that I delete the next day. I’m not out of that forest yet, really.”  Sir Salman detailed his recovery in an interview with the New Yorker magazine ahead of the launch of his new book, Victory City, written before the attack. He said he has spent the past seven months at his New York home, watching “crap television”. He added: “The big injuries are healed, essentially. I’m doing a lot of hand therapy, and I’m told I’m doing very well. “There have been nightmares. Not exactly the incident, but just frightening. Those seem to be diminishing. I’m fine. I’m able to get up and walk around. When I say I’m fine, I mean there are bits of my body that need constant checkups. It was a colossal attack.”  The Booker Prize winner, whose 1988 novel The Satanic Verses led to a fatwa calling for his death, joked that the attack has made him more popular. He said: “Now that I’ve almost died, everybody loves me. That was my mistake back then. Not only did I live, but I tried to live well. Bad mistake. Get 15 stab wounds, much better.” Hadi Matar, 24, of Fairview, New Jersey, has been charged with second-degree attempted murder and second-degree assault, which he denies, and will likely be tried next year. He has reportedly refused to say if the fatwa by late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini led to the attack. Asked about his attacker, Sir Salman called him “an idiot”.",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/sir-salman-rushdie-struggles-write-29150170
Man tells of 'one in a billion' wife who died suddenly after catching 'mild cold',"Ricky Hill, from Coventry, has paid tribute to his wife Lindsey Victoria Hill as ""one in a billion"" after she sadly died having gone into hospital with a mild cold over Christmas A devastated man paid tribute to his wife as ""one in a billion"" after she suddenly went downhill and died following ""a bit of a cold"" over Christmas.  Ricky Hill, from Coventry, said his world has fallen apart since the tragic death of wife Lindsey Victoria Hill who died on January 28. He said that his wife was suffering from a mild cold over the festive period but her condition quickly deteriorated in hospital where she picked up sepsis, reported CoventryLive. “She had a bit of a cough and a bit of a cold. We thought it was down to the flu that everybody had but she started to get worse,” said Ricky.  Lindsey was already battling a number of health problems, when she picked up the original cold and was prescribed antibiotics by her GP.   But as her condition continued to deteriorate, Ricky took the decision to dial 999 after feeling that ""something was not quite right"".  Paramedics said due to existing health problems, the 40-year-old would need to be taken to hospital for precautionary checks. And it was at University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire that Lindsey picked up sepsis which her husband Ricky termed a ""killer"". Ricky was told to prepare for the worst as doctors said they had exhausted every possible option to save Lindsey who died hours later, aged 40.  “Lindsey, my beautiful wife, gained her angel wings on Saturday, January 28 and I sadly lost her,” he said. “She was one in a billion. She would go into any room and she would light it up.   “If you needed anything, no matter how big or small, if she had it, she would give it to you. If she had her last pound and somebody needed it more than her, she would give it away. She was amazing, there are no other words to describe her.” Ricky said his wife changed his life after supporting him during some of his toughest moments. Looking up at the sky, he said: “She is the brightest star in the sky. “She was everything a man could ask for and more. I was homeless, I had nowhere to go and she changed my life.”  Ricky said he has been ""overwhelmed"" by the support he has received since the death of his wife Lindsey.

Little boy died suddenly before second birthday - and nobody can tell his mum why,"There are more unexplained childhood deaths in one to nine year olds than those caused by tragic accidents, fires or drowning. Eimear O'Hagan meets the families calling for answersHannah Johnston should be looking forward to her youngest son William’s third birthday.  But instead of baking a cake, wrapping gifts and hosting a party, Hannah will mark the date this month by releasing a balloon and planting a rose bush in memory of William, who died in November 2021 at 21 months. To lose a child is every parent’s nightmare, but Hannah’s grief is compounded by the fact that she does not even know why William died. His death was categorised as Sudden Unexpected Death In Childhood (SUDC) – the sudden and unexpected death of a child aged one to 18, which remains unexplained after thorough investigation. “The absence of why this happened to William, and to our family, has only added to our trauma and left us in a terrible limbo, unable to properly grieve because we have no reasons or answers,” says Hannah, 38, who lives in Surrey with husband Keith, 40, and their two other sons, Max, seven, and Lewis, six. The Johnston family is not alone in experiencing the devastating pain of a child’s unexplained death. According to the Office for National Statistics, SUDC is the fourth leading category of death for children aged one to four years old.   There are more unexplained childhood deaths in one to nine year olds than those caused by traffic accidents, fires or drowning. On November 13, 2021, William, who had been a normal, healthy little boy, bar suffering the odd sniffle and temperature like most children his age, suffered a prolonged febrile seizure while in his high chair in the kitchen. “At first I thought he was choking on the pizza I’d given him for tea, but when I saw his stiff body and eyes rolled back, I realised he was having a seizure,” says Hannah. “Keith and Lewis were both out, but Max was with me, crying hysterically, and I dialled 999.” Paramedics arrived quickly but it was 45 minutes before William’s seizure stopped, although he didn’t regain consciousness. He went on to suffer two cardiac arrests in the ambulance, one in the driveway of the family home and the other on the way to the nearby Royal Surrey Hospital. “Keith and I were in the car behind the ambulance and when it pulled into the side of the road, it was the most horrific feeling not knowing what was happening inside, was my child alive or dead? I felt swamped with terror and completely out of control,” remembers Hannah. “On arriving at A&E, we learned his heart had stopped for 11 minutes, but the paramedics had brought him back.” After being transferred to the Evelina London Children’s Hospital, because it had a paediatric ICU, Hannah and Keith were given devastating news. Tests had revealed William had very little brain activity and it was likely he would die.  “I’d been clinging on to hope until that moment, but that was gone,” says Hannah. Over the coming days, William’s condition continued to deteriorate. “Keith and I lay with him for hours, pouring all our love into him, and I sang the song Chasing Cars by Snow Patrol: ‘If I lay here, if I just lay here, would you lie with me and just forget the world…’ with tears falling down my face. I simply couldn’t believe this was happening.” On November 17, William’s life support was withdrawn and, after 17 minutes, he took his last breath. “It was impossible to process that less than two years before I’d held him for the first time as a newborn and now he was dead in my arms,” says Hannah. In April, the Johnstons were told William’s postmortem had found no explanation for his death, and so it was classified as SUDC. “I wasn’t shocked. I knew he’d been a healthy child and I hadn’t missed any warning sign he was poorly. “But I felt bewildered, I’d never even heard of SUDC. I began to research it and was stunned to learn that around 40 children a year in the UK are affected by it, and yet there is so little awareness and no public funding for research.”   Nikki Speed is the chief executive of SUDC UK, a charity she co-founded with two other bereaved parents in 2017 after the unexplained death of her two-year-old daughter Rosie in 2013, who passed away in her sleep. “The charity’s mission is to see scientific research into SUDC prioritised and funded, for there to be consistent national medical training and education, and improved public information about it to raise awareness,” says Nikki. “We want to not only support families and give them answers after the loss of a child about why it happened, but also prevent future deaths. “That was achieved with SIDS [Sudden Infant Death Syndrome] through research and awareness, with an 80 per cent reduction in deaths, and we want to replicate that with SUDC and save the lives of older children. “We are already identifying from data collection and research, trends and areas for investigation. For example, 27 per cent of children whose death was labelled as SUDC had a medical history of febrile convulsions, but that still leaves 73 per cent of deaths that need further investigation. It’s just not good enough that in 2023 children are dying and we don’t know why.”   Last month the MP for Spelthorne and former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng, opened a debate in the House of Commons on SUDC, the first time it had ever been discussed in Parliament.  “Listening to MPs give SUDC-bereaved families across the country a voice in Parliament was momentous and emotional,” says Nikki. “There was a strong feeling in the room that far too little had been done for too long and that this was the beginning of a movement to collaborate to prevent future tragedies. “SUDC UK left the debate, with a number of bereaved parents, feeling like this was a critical, very positive step forward. We hope the commitment to research, education and public information from the Minister for Primary Care and Public Health will help changes be made with urgency.” Another mother desperate that other families do not have to endure the pain of an unexplained death is Julia Rogers, whose son Louis died aged 22 months. On June 18, 2021, Julia put Louis to bed and kissed him goodnight, unaware she would never see him alive again.  “He’d been a bit under the weather that day, with a mild temperature, and I’d kept him home from nursery and given him Calpol. But by the afternoon he’d perked up and was playing,” remembers Julia.   “After his bath, I put him to bed at 7pm and had his video monitor switched on to keep an eye on him while I unpacked some shopping. “Around 8.30pm, something just didn’t feel right and I decided to go and check on him. The room was completely silent and he was still. “I said his name and stroked his hair but he didn’t respond, my beautiful son had died. I performed CPR until an ambulance arrived and he was taken to hospital, but declared dead. “In the space of a few hours, our happy life was torn apart.” Like the Johnstons, Julia and her husband Christian, 44, were told after a postmortem at Great Ormond Street Hospital that Louis’ death had been categorised as SUDC because a cause could not be confirmed. But the couple, who live in Shepperton, Surrey, with their daughter, Thea, eight, believe there were warning signs in Louis’ medical history that were overlooked and dismissed. “Between September 2020 and February 2021 Louis suffered three witnessed febrile seizures – including two in 24 hours – and on each occasion was seen by either a doctor or a paramedic,” says Julia. “There were no further investigations, the attitude each time was very much this is ‘normal’ in children and I was simply told to keep him cool and give paracetamol. “Then in May 2021, the month before his death, on two separate occasions we took him to A&E and the GP because we were concerned about his co-ordination and ‘flitting’ eyes. Both times there was no follow-up or advice. I felt like I was being an over-anxious parent and remember asking the GP at the final appointment before Louis died, should I keep a diary of all my concerns? His response was: ‘If you want’. “Weeks later, Louis was dead.” Julia has had support from SUDC UK and while nothing will bring back her son, she supports the charity’s work for the sake of other families in the future. “To be left asking ‘what happened to my child, what could I have done differently, could he have been saved?’ it’s like a purgatory, and it’s so hard to believe and accept he is gone when I don’t know why. “We need to better understand SUDC so it can be predicted and prevented, in order that other parents aren’t left the way we have been – devastated and without knowing why our precious child is no longer here.”  For further information or to donate to SUDC UK, visit sudc.org.uk  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mums-little-boy-died-suddenly-29150093
Woman lost an eye to deadly brain tumour which GP fobbed off as 'attention seeking',"Vikki Hindley from Manchester was fobbed off as having anorexia 'to get attention', but later scans at Wythenshawe Hospital showed she had a life-threatening brain tumourA woman turned away by a GP for being an 'attention seeker' has told how she was then diagnosed with a deadly brain tumour which resulted in her losing an eye.  When Vikki Hindley went to see her doctor complaining of headaches and nausea, she was fobbed off as faking an eating disorder for attention. But scans went on to show the then 16-year-old had squamous cell carcinoma, which had spread to the frontal lobe of her brain. Now 41, Vikki, has told how she had been visiting her nan in Manchester during 1997 while feeling ill, and was taken to the GP. He sent her to Wythenshawe Hospital for a sinus wash which found a cancerous polyp.    ""I had an MRI scan and was bluntly told I had cancer. They said they couldn’t operate because the squamous cell carcinoma had spread to the frontal lobe of my brain. “I had chemotherapy at the Christie Hospital in Manchester as mum and I had moved back there. It was very intense and I lost my hair. ''I was constantly sick and everything I ate came straight back up. I went down to four stone so I needed to be put on a feeding tube.""  Now living in Manchester herself, Vikki said she also had to undergo radiotherapy which burnt the side of her neck and the bottom half of her head. ''It also resulted in me losing my right eye and the hearing in my right ear. It was devastating. The older I got, the more the realisation set in just how poorly I was.” The cancer had also spread to Vikki's sinus and glands, and she now subsequently has various health problems, such as fibromyalgia and osteoporosis.  Vikki is working with the charity Brain Tumour Research and is doing the 10,000 Steps a Day in February challenge to help find a cure for the disease. She said: “It’s so important to me because I’m still here and I’m so grateful. Research has helped me to be here. This challenge will be hard for me, but I’m determined to do it. If I can give back just a little bit, then it’s all worth it.” You can donate to Vikki's fundraising page here. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/woman-lost-eye-deadly-brain-29151444
Three US tourists 'stabbed' in Puerto Rico for taking photographs after street chase,"Three US tourists were reportedly stabbed in Puerto Rico after one of them took photographs. Wallace Alonso Florence, 37, Carlos Sánchez Brown, 39, and Jackson Brandom Tremayne, 38, were chased through the streets of San Juan, Puerto RicoThree tourists from the US were reportedly stabbed for taking photos.  Wallace Alonso Florence, 37, Carlos Sánchez Brown, 39, and Jackson Brandom Tremayne, 38, were chased through the streets of San Juan, Puerto Rico early on Monday. Tremayne, from Georgia, was stabbed six times and is still in hospital after sustaining wounds to his abdomen, chest and back around 4.11am. Florence and Sánchez Brown, meanwhile, were both hit in the head.  Another of the three is also still in hospital, but both are reported to be in stable condition.  Local media NotiCentro Digital reported that the tourists were told to stop taking pictures on their phone while filming a mobile hamburger stall, according to the San Juan Municipal Police.    The suspect remains at large.  The attack occurred in front of a monastery on San Sebastian Street in the Old San Juan area of the Puerto Rican capital. Reports indicate the area was once well-known for drug-related activities. The area, known as La Puerla is known for featuring in the video for the song 'Despacito,' by Puerto Rican singers Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee. La Puerla was once the major crossroads for heroin distribution in Puerto Rico, but crime has come down since a raid in 2011. Since, the area has become an increasingly popular area for tourists, particularly after an effort to revamp it in 2017. In April 2021, Tariq Quadir Loat, 24 and from Delaware, died after a group objected to him taking photos. Loat died after he was attacked with items including a piece of wood and a deep fryer.  A friend he was with, James Jackson, survived after escaping but was hospitalised.  After going missing, Loat's burned body was 20 miles west of San Juan. Authorities confirmed he died from a gunshot wound. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/three-tourists-stabbed-puerto-rico-29151608
"Climber, 23, dies after falling 600ft from Snowdonia mountain ridge when handhold broke","Devastated friends and family took to social media to pay tribute to the climber, named locally as Jack Carne, describing him as a ""true gentleman"" and the ""nicest lad you'll ever meet""A climber has died after falling 600ft from a Snowdonia mountain ridge while hiking with two friends at the weekend. The 23-year-old, named locally as Jack Carne, was ascending Y Gribin in North Wales at 5pm on Saturday when a handhold broke, which he was using to pull himself up, causing him to fall down the mountainside. Mountain rescue teams were called to the scene and had recovered the man's body with the help of a coastguard helicopter by Sunday afternoon. Chris Lloyd, the chairman of the Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Organisation (OVMRO), said the incident was a ""tragic accident and very, very unfortunate"". Devastated friends and family took to social media to pay tribute to Jack, from Yorkshire, describing him as a ""true gentleman"" and the ""nicest lad you'll ever meet"".   Responding to the rescue team, Jack's grandma wrote: ""A massive thank you to all involved risking your own lives to help my grandson and his friends, we are all heartbroken beyond words. ""You will be forever in my heart and thoughts Jack my beautiful grandson."" His girlfriend commented: ""The bravery from you is overwhelming. Thank you so much for everything. I am absolutely heartbroken."" A friend wrote: ""RIP Jack Carne you were a well known lad who never did anyone wrong, heart of gold. Sending love to your family and friends in this horrible time."" Another said: ""What a sad tragedy, doing what he loved and falling to his death... RIP Jack."" And a third posted: ""Rest in peace Jack brother! You are clearly wholeheartedly loved, cherished and deeply missed by so many people who were lucky enough to have met you.""  A total of 12 OVMRO rescuers searched for his body, which was found in the darkness shortly after 9pm with no signs of life. Mr Lloyd, who was part of the rescue effort, said: ""He disappeared into the cloud below, falling a good distance down some very steep and nasty ground. ""His two colleagues saw him go so they tried to scramble to the edge to see where he had gone and climbed down quite a bit. It was becoming really difficult ground and they called for him but there was no response. ""It is just a tragic accident and very, very unfortunate. The lads have not done anything wrong. This rock just came away in his hand. It is just so sad."" Cloudy conditions, regular rockfalls and widespread ice in the valley where the man's body lay meant the rescuers could not attempt to evacuate the man's body until Sunday morning. Clearer weather then allowed volunteers to carry his body on a stretcher down steep, boulder-strewn terrain for 300 metres to a waiting Caernarfon coastguard helicopter that then handed the body to an undertaker. Mr Lloyd added: ""They were three young men. They have done a lot of hillwalking together and were well-equipped and had all the right kit. ""They were actually going to go and do some wild camping which is why they were so high so late. ""It is quite a popular ridge to go up and it has a little bit of a scramble towards the top so a lot of people walk up there. ""It is not difficult at all but there is loose rock up there, there's no doubt about that. There were definitely good patches of ice. It was just thin layers of it. ""You couldn't really see it and you couldn't tell whether it was wet rock or ice and it is easy to be caught out."" OVMRO's volunteers are on standby 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year to attend mountaineering incidents in the Snowdonia National Park's Ogwen Valley. The group was called out 178 times last year and depends almost entirely on public donations to fund its operations. It is one of six volunteer rescue groups in North Wales.

"Chinese spy balloon might have been rigged with explosives to self-destruct, says Pentagon","A Chinese spy balloon shot down in the US may have had explosives, the Pentagon has said. ""I can't confirm whether it had explosives or not,"" Air Force General Glen D. VanHerck, saidOne of America’s top generals has said the US is investigating whether the Chinese spy balloon shot down over the Atlantic was carrying explosives. Air Force General Glen D. VanHerck, commander of US Northern Command, revealed new details about the device yesterday. He said the balloon was around 200 feet tall, weighing thousands of pounds, and with a payload the size of a jetliner. “So I can't confirm whether it had explosives or not,” he said. “Anytime you down something like this, we make an assumption that that potential exists.” His description came as the Pentagon defended Joe Biden's decision to wait and shoot down the Chinese craft until it cleared US land, which earned some criticism from his Republican opponents.   There were fears it could lead to fatalities on the ground if shot down while above the mainland. The President ordered the spycraft to be shot down last Wednesday as it hovered over Montana, but under the advice of generals, it was held off until Saturday. The Air Force eventually sent an F-22 fighter jet armed with an AIM-9X Sidewinder missile to down the balloon, first spotted on February 1 over the skies of Montana.  VanHerck said: ""So glass off of solar panels, potentially hazardous material, such as material that is required for batteries to operate in such an environment as this and even the potential for explosives to detonate and destroy the balloon that – that could have been present."" It weighed thousands of pounds, was around 200 feet tall and carried the same payload as a jetliner.    National Security Council spokesman John Kirby added: “Because the president decided they wouldn’t shoot it down until he could do so safely, and that meant over water, that afforded us a terrific opportunity to gain a better understanding, to study the capabilities of this balloon.” Kirby explained that the process of shooting down the balloon has since made it difficult to determine if the device did indeed have explosives inside. He added: ""So I can’t confirm whether it had explosives or not.   ""Anytime you down something like this, we make an assumption that that potential exists.   Now, a team is combing through a debris field off the coast of South Carolina around 1,500 metres by 1,500 metres across. The USS Carter Hall is collecting and categorising the debris along with the USNS Pathfinder. After it is collected, the debris will be sent to the FBI headquarters in Quantico, Virginia, for analysis. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/chinese-spy-balloon-might-been-29151354

The schoolgirl had been reported missing by her concerned parents on Sunday afternoon from Galashiels' town centre. A huge search operation was launched to track her down, with members of her family spending all of last night joining the search.  Police Scotland has now confirmed in a statement that the 11-year-old has been found 'safe and well'.  They said in an update: ""We can confirm Kaitlyn Easson reported missing from Galashiels has been traced safe and well. ""Thank you to all who shared our appeals.""

"Nicola Bulley police think her phone could be a decoy left by river, says expert","Underwater forensics expert Peter Faulding believes Nicola Bulley's mobile phone may have been left by the River Wyre as a decoy, as police continue to search for answers about her disappearanceAn underwater forensics expert believes missing mum Nicola Bulley's phone may have been left by the river as decoy. Specialist Group International (SGI) were drafted in by police yesterday to help trawl the River Wyre for the dog walker. Founder Peter Faulding, who was yesterday pictured operating the firm's high-tech side scan sonar from a boat, said he is ""truly baffled"" by the case. He admits there are many confusing elements, and prior to joining the search yesterday told the Mirror he expected SGI's equipment to find Nicola in under an hour if she was in fact in the river. Despite finding little in the way of clues so far, he has since said he does believe she went into the water and he's set to head back out later today.   Mr Faulding said all the police have to go on right now is Nicola's phone, which was left on a bench overlooking where investigators suggest she may have fallen in. Her dog was found wandering alone nearby, with her harness and lead removed. Speaking to TalkTV last night, Mr Faulding said: ""After 25 years of doing this kind of work, after hundreds of cases, I am well and truly baffled. ""When people drown they generally go down where they are. We normally find them within five to ten metres of where they went down even after a few days.   ""This is the most baffling case that I have ever worked on. The police have nothing to go on. ""All they have is a mobile phone at the moment and they said it could possibly be a decoy.""  Nicola had dropped her two daughters at school in St Michaels on Wyre on the morning of January 27 and then took springer spaniel Willow for a walk along a river towpath. She was seen for a final time by a witness at around 9.10am, having logged into a work conference call at just after the hour.  At 9.33am another dog walker found her phone on a bench, with a distressed Willow nearby. Police subsequently launched a major search operation, which is now entering its 12th day. Last week Superintendent Sally Riley said investigators were working under the main assumption that she accidentally fell into the river. However, she admitted there was no clear evidence of that. Nicola's boyfriend Paul Ansell released another appeal and thanked Mr Faulding and his team for the efforts.   ""I have two little girls who miss their mummy desperately and who need her back,"" he said. ""This has been such a tough time for the girls especially but also for me and all of Nicola's family and friends, as well as the wider community and I want to thank them for their love and support. ""We are also really grateful to Peter and his team from SGI for coming up and helping support the work of Lancashire Police as they continue their investigation. ""If anyone has any information which could help find Nicola, I urge them to get in touch with the police and help us provide the answers we all so badly need.""

Shameless Boris Johnson and Liz Truss must take blame for 'chaos' says ex-Tory leader,"Former Conservative leader William Hague slammed remorseless ex-PMs Boris Johnson and Liz Truss for failing accept responsibility for their disastrous stints in Downing Street Former Tory leader William Hague has torn into blame-dodging Liz Truss and Boris Johnson for refusing to accept responsibility for their mistakes. Lord Hague said political leaders who are unwilling to take the blame for their failures can have a ""corrosive effect"" on public life, pointing to Donald Trump's refusal to accept defeat in the US elections. He mocked both Ms Truss and Mr Johnson for their stubborn responses to being ousted from power by their own MPs after chaos and scandal. Writing in the Times, he said: ""If you became Prime Minister, with a majority behind you and a decent term in front of you, but were overthrown amid chaos, there is indeed someone to blame. It’s you."" Ms Truss is attempting to whitewash her disastrous stint in No10 by blaming MPs, the public, civil servants and the markets for her downfall after her tax-slashing plans triggered economic chaos.   The ex-PM moaned about her critics in a 4,000-word essay for the Telegraph at the weekend, in her first public intervention since she was forced out of Downing Street after just 49 days. In an interview with the Spectator, she also dismissed complaints that households have been hit by higher mortgage costs thanks to her catastrophic mini-Budget. But in a small bit of good news, she said she had no plans to be PM again. Her predecessor Mr Johnson tried to cling onto power as dozens of his ministers quit but was eventually forced to step down. However the shameless ex-PM struck a bullish note in his resignation speech - blaming the ""herd"" of MPs for moving against him. In a brutal takedown, Lord Hague said: ""It is as if their ejection — at the hands of their own party — was due to events no one could have expected and forces that could not be controlled.   ""They were confounded by a mysterious and powerful entity, perhaps a “Blob” or the dreaded Establishment, that jumped out and mugged them when they were innocently minding their own business as the most powerful person in the country.  ""How could they do anything about that? They were shockingly let down by MPs who unexpectedly listened to the views of their constituents. What can a prime minister do with such people?"" He said Mr Johnson ""showed no awareness of any personal failings that had led his party to turn on him"" and said he had ""tried to break rules that no one had previously thought it necessary to state"". Lord Hague also rubbished Ms Truss's attempts to blame the establishment for her disastrous economic policies. He said: ""The problem was not the power of a left-wing establishment but the force of good old right-wing arithmetic: there are limits on spending money you haven’t got."" He added: “It is your job as leader to find the best path, pick the right fights and summon enough help, and if you can’t do that it is your own fault, not something to blame on your companions.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/shameless-boris-johnson-liz-truss-29151876
Vladimir Putin loses another general in Ukraine - taking key commanders killed to 10,"Major-General Dmitry Ulyanov was reportedly killed in a firefight during an attack by a Ukrainian sabotage group earlier this week, meaning Vladimir Putin has lost at least 10 top brass in the war Vladimir Putin has lost yet another general in the war in Ukraine, according to reports.  Major-General Dmitry Ulyanov, 44, had returned to active service after retirement as a commander in Russia's illegal Ukrainian invasion. He died in a firefight when he was attacked by a Ukrainian sabotage group this week, it has been claimed. Previously Ulyanov was a top paratrooper, commander of the elite 98th Guards Airborne Division. He went to the current war commanding a regiment of mobilised motorised infantrymen from Tatarstan. Ulyanov had earlier served as the Chief of Staff of the 7th Airborne Division, commander of the 1141st artillery regiment, and commander of the 98th Airborne Division, say open sources.   Ulyanov is the first such high ranked commander to be killed for many months. A family friend posted that he had been the son of a commander. “Like his father did not sit in the rear, he went to the front line,” said the eulogy. “Glory to the Hero! Glory to the Airborne Forces!”  The death means Putin has lost at least 10 such senior commanders. Reports last year named the following top brass killed in the war: Lt-Gen Yakov Rezantsev, 48, Maj-Gen Andrei Kolesnikov, 45, Maj-Gen Andrey Sukhovetsky, , Maj-Gen Vitaly Gerasimov, 44, Maj-Gen Vladimir Frolov, 54, Maj-Gen Andrei Simonov, 55, Maj-Gen Oleg Mityaev, 48, Maj-Gen Kanamat Botashev, 63, and Maj-Gen Roman Kutuzov, 53. Several other earlier claims of high ranking officers killed in the war were not subsequently confirmed. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putin-loses-another-general-29151546
Rishi Sunak's Cabinet reshuffle in full as Zahawi replaced and 4 new departments created,"The Prime Minister was forced to shake up his Cabinet after sacking Tory chairman Nadhim Zahawi in a row over his tax affairs Rishi Sunak has reshuffled his Cabinet to replaced sacked Tory chairman Nadhim Zahawi and carried out a sweeping overhaul of Whitehall departments.  Trade Minister Greg Hands has been named as the new Tory chairman after Mr Zahawi was fired for breaching the ministerial code in a row over his tax affairs. Mr Sunak has created four new Whitehall departments including a new Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and a Department for Science, Innovation and Technology. There will be a new combined Department for Business and Trade, while the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has lost its digital focus. Business Secretary Grant Shapps becomes the new Energy Security Secretary, while Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan will be the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology.   Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch becomes Secretary of State for Business and Trade. She keeps her role as Minister for Women and Equalities. Lucy Frazer, a Housing Minister, has been handed a Cabinet post as the new Culture Secretary. Her promotion means Mr Sunak must appoint a new minister - the 15th person to hold that job since 2010 and the sixth in a year. She becomes the eighth Culture Secretary in five years. Downing Street said the new departments would underscore Mr Sunak's pledges to halve inflation, grow the economy, reduce debt, cut waiting lists and stop the arrival of small boats. But the Liberal Democrats accused him of frittering away taxpayers' cash on ""costly vanity projects"". Pointing to Institute for Government (IfG) analysis that setting up a new department costs £15million, the party estimated the bill could top £60million.  Liberal Democrat Cabinet Office spokesperson Christine Jardine said that Rishi Sunak was ""looking weaker by the day, and this rudderless reshuffle is the latest proof"". ""This reshuffle will cost the public millions while failing to change the trajectory of this Government in crisis. ""Rather than fritter away tens of millions of taxpayers' cash on costly vanity projects, Sunak should spend the money where it's most needed. ""This cash could fund 25 million free school meals."" It comes after weeks of bad headlines for the Prime Minister over his scandal-hit ministers as he struggles to turn around his party's dire poll ratings.  His pledge to govern with ""integrity, professionalism and accountability"" when he entered No10 more than a 100 days ago was called into question by the row over Mr Zahawi's tax affairs and the bullying claims dogging Deputy PM Dominic Raab. Under-fire Deputy PM Dominic Raab will stay in post while an independent probe into a string of bullying allegations against him is completed. Downing Street has resisted calls to sack Mr Raab and repeatedly said that top KC Adam Tolley must be allowed to complete his investigation. Eight formal complaints - said to involve at least 24 officials - are being probed from Mr Raab's stints at the Ministry of Justice, the Foreign Office and the now defunct Brexit department. The Tory chairman post will be key in the run up to the local elections in May, which will provide Mr Sunak with his first major electoral test since taking office.  Reshuffle in full  Grant Shapps as Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero Michelle Donelan as Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology Kemi Badenoch as Secretary of State for Business and Trade.

PC David Carrick jailed for 30 years after he's unmasked as one of UK's worst rapists,"WARNING - DISTRESSING CONTENT: David Carrick was unmasked as one of Britain's most prolific sex offenders after he admitted to 24 counts of rape as well as charges of sexual assault, controlling and coercive behaviour and false imprisonmentA former Metropolitan Police officer has been jailed for 30 years for attacking a dozen women in an ""unrestrained campaign of rape and abuse"" over an 18-year period. David Carrick, 48, was unmasked as one of Britain's most prolific sex offenders after he admitted to 24 counts of rape as well as charges of sexual assault, controlling and coercive behaviour and false imprisonment. Following a two-day sentencing hearing at Southwark Crown Court, Carrick remained emotionless as Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb threw him behind bars for a minimum of three decades and 239 days. Carrick's crimes were all carried out while serving with the force guarding sites including embassies and the Houses of Parliament, and completed training courses, including one on domestic abuse in 2005. Carrick - who appeared in the dock at Southwark Crown Court, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and tie - was told by the judge he was a ""high risk"" offender who posed a ""grave danger"" to the public. Mrs continued: ""Behind a public appearance of propriety and trustworthiness you took monstrous advantage of women."" She revealed Carrick had tried to kill himself but dismissed this, saying: “You were driven to try to commit suicide as a self-pitying reaction to the shame brought on you by these proceedings rather than remorse.” Telling Carrick he'd shown an ""astonishing degree of moral corruption"" and abused the position of police constable, Justice Cheema-Grubb said ""you behaved as if you were untouchable"". She said he was ""bold and relentless"" and acted on the trust that ""no victim would overcome her shame and fear to report you"".   Speaking to Carrick, she said: ""For nearly two decades you were proved right. ""Now a combination of 12 women and your police colleagues acting on evidence have exposed you. ""You have lost your liberty, your job and your status. You have before you a difficult time in custody for many years."" She told Carrick that his victims remain traumatised after what he put them through.  The judge detailed the ordeal suffered by his first victim, who after being raped at gunpoint, was told by a nurse treating her injuries that Carrick's fellow officers would protect him if she complained.  Carrick showed ""utter contempt"" for another woman whom he shut naked into a small cupboard under his stairs, the judge continued. ""You drilled into her that you were the police and the law,"" she said. The judge said of the women: ""You have shaped their lives, deprived them of the ability to trust men and form relationships. They don't trust the police.""  However, she hailed the women who came forward and reported Carrick. She said it was ""remarkable"" that one who was driven to come forward led to others. She said: ""Courage calls to courage everywhere and its voice cannot be denied"". Carrick worked at the Met from 2001 until he was sacked last month. In 2009, he became an armed officer with the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command. He guarded sites including embassies and the Houses of Parliament, and completed a training course on domestic abuse in 2005.  Prosecutor Tom Little KC, opened the case on Monday morning listing all the charges the serial rapist had admitted to. Mr Little said the case fell short of meriting a whole-life sentence - because he had not killed anyone and pleaded guilty - but called for a life sentence with a fixed minimum term. In the end Carrick received a total of 36 life terms. The court heard how Carrick carried out a “catalogue of violent and brutal sexual offences… on multiple victims”. The prosecutor said Carrick “humiliated his victims in a number of ways”. Carrick remained emotionless with his head bowed and eyes closed while Mr Little recounted the extremely graphic nature of his crimes. One woman told how he held a gun to her head and said he would be the last thing she saw.  Carrick had lured the woman to his flat saying he was the ""safest person"" she could be with because he was an officer but then threatened her with the weapon when she tried to leave. In a victim impact statement, she said: ""That night, I felt I had encountered evil. I honestly thought he was going to kill me that night. ""I felt lucky to be able to leave the next morning as I didn't believe I would be doing so. I felt so ashamed, dirty and sick."" Speaking about the victim’s ordeal, Mr Little said: “He asked her to sit beside him. She said no. “He then got up and went to kiss her and again she said no. She told him that she wasn’t interested. He apologised and said sorry. “They spoke for a while and then she said that she was going to go. She went for the door and tried to open it but she couldn’t do it.""  Mr Little said Carrick held a black handgun to the victim’s head before telling her “you are not going” as he raped her. Other women said they feared they would not be believed if they reported Carrick and no longer trusted the police after what he had done to them. One of Carrick's victims was told by an A&E nurse that if she complained it ""might not go to court"". Mr Little said the woman attended King’s College Hospital with external and internal injuries after being raped by Carrick. In a victim statement read out by Mr Little, she detailed how she felt ""lucky to be able to leave"" the next morning. ""I walked down the road quickly and got on the Tube at Tooting Broadway. I later went to a phone box and called my doctor who advised me to go straight to the hospital.  ""I distinctly remember standing in the room with the nurse and having them list my injuries and I felt ashamed, dirty and sick. I remember aching all over from the terrible things he did to me that night."" Carrick had been the subject of a string of police complaints when he raped a 37-year-old cleaner who he met on the Badoo dating app in 2018. She said: ""I don't trust the police any more. If anything went wrong I don't know whether I would want to call the police."" A woman who he raped 20 times said she was convinced the police would not investigate her complaint.Her statement read: ""I was too frightened to go to the police, as the defendant had drilled it into me that he was the police, he was the law and he owned me."" Another said she ""couldn't see an escape"" while he abused her. The court heard how Carrick used his baton and handcuffs during attacks. Carrick, who would drink two bottles of wine before going to work, was nicknamed B*****d Dave by colleagues. He attacked one woman while her 10-year-old daughter was having a sleepover. Mr Little said: ""She begged him not to do it as she knew her daughter and friends would hear. However, the defendant just carried on."" Carrick raped another partner on a camping trip while her parents slept in the tent next to them. And he sent an image of himself with a work-issue firearm to a victim, saying, ""Remember I am the boss"". Mr Little told Southwark Crown Court: “He told her that she belonged to him and that she must obey him. “He threatened her with his police baton and sent her a photograph of his work-issue firearm saying ‘remember I am the boss’. “He told her that she should obey him and that, if she did, he would give her an amazing life.” A statement from Carrick's fifth victim read aloud in court detailed the devastating impact his crimes had on her life including how it ""destroyed"" her marriage and prompted her to drop four dress sizes and start to binge drink.  She also began to engage in overtly sexual behaviour, feeling it was the only way to take control of her feelings. ""All I wanted was to have friends and be liked. But I felt that the only way to do that was to have sexual relationships. I engaged in a sexual relationship with men and women that I didn’t want,"" she said. ""I would lie to my husband about what I was doing to people. I lived off adrenaline and nicotine and had a very short temper with my children and husband."" She added: ""I truly thought my husband and kids would be better off without me. I was truly at rock bottom."" Mr Little told the court about another one of Carrick's victims being shut under a cupboard under the stairs.  He said Carrick would force go into the cupboard when she did something he didn't like where he would be on the other side of the door and ""whistle at her as if she was a dog"". Carrick also had cameras in his house where he would spy on his victims while he was out. Carrick claimed they were to watch his pet snakes. Another of Carrick’s victims said she felt “trapped” and “couldn’t see an escape” while he abused her. Her statement read: “There are so many mental and physical scars that remain.” She said Carrick made her feel like a “piece of dirt on his shoe” while he was “eliminating my support network”. “I actually thought I might die,” she said. “I felt trapped. I couldn’t see an escape and he made me feel like I had no-one. “I never wanted to be in that situation ever again.”  After Carrick pleaded guilty it later emerged that the Met was informed of nine incidents - including allegations of rape, domestic violence and harassment - between 2000 and 2021. Mr Little said the case fell short of meriting a whole-life sentence - because he had not killed anyone and pleaded guilty - but called for a life sentence with a fixed minimum term. Alisdair Williamson KC, defending, said Carrick ""accepts fully responsibility for what he has done"" and that it is likely any life sentence will ""bring him close to, if not to, the close of his natural life"".  Police chiefs across England and Wales have since been asked to have all officers checked against national police databases by the end of March. Carrick, who served in the Army before joining the Met, admitted 49 criminal charges, but some of the attacks are multiple incident counts, meaning they relate to more than 80 sexual offences, including at least 48 rapes against 12 women. He denied a further count of rape in September 2020 relating to a 13th woman, whose allegation triggered the investigation, and the Crown Prosecution Service decided it was not in the public interest to proceed to trial on the charge.  The Met was forced to apologise and admit Carrick should have been rooted out earlier after it emerged he came to police attention over nine incidents - including allegations of rape, domestic violence and harassment - between 2000 and 2021, with all but one of the incidents relating to his behaviour towards women. Carrick faced no criminal sanctions or misconduct findings and police chiefs across England and Wales have since been asked to have all officers checked against national police databases by the end of March. He was finally sacked from the force last month after pleading guilty and being unmasked as one of the country's most prolific sex offenders. Today the court heard Carrick ad attempted to kill himself while on remand at Belmarsh prison and was detained in a secure hospital but was found not to be suffering from any mental disorder. The judge gave a scathing assessment of his ""self-pitying"" motive for the suicide bid as she revealed it at his sentencing hearing. Carrick's crimes are set to form part of the independent inquiry looking at the murder of Sarah Everard, who was raped and strangled by then-serving Met officer Wayne Couzens in March 2021. Police are also calling for other women who think they may have been victims of Carrick to come forward.  Hertfordshire Police’s Detective Inspector Iain Moor said: “Our investigation does not stop here, we have set up a special reporting portal to allow people to continue to share information about David Carrick with us.  “If anyone else thinks they have been a victim, we still want to hear from you and we will support you.""  Immediately after sentencing he praised the women who had reported Carrick, saying: ""This has been a very long and challenging investigation and it is a testament to the bravery of the victims, who were prepared to relive their ordeals and face him in court, and my officers’ unwavering and dedicated pursuit for justice, that David Carrick has been handed a life sentence with a minimum term of 30 years."" Met Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley apologised for the ""missed opportunities to identify the warning signs"" of Carrick's behaviour. He said: ""I and tens of thousands of officers and staff in the Met are horrified by this man’s crimes and recognise this will shake Londoners trust too. “We have let down women across London but we are more determined than ever to put it right. “I have been clear, we will rid the Met of those who corrupt our integrity by bringing the same intensive investigative approach to identifying wrongdoing in our own ranks as we do to identifying criminals in the community.

Nicola Bulley police respond to foul play claims as they hunt 700 drivers,"Mum-of-two Nicola Bulley, 45, disappeared while on a dog walk on January 27 in St Michaels on Wyre, leading to a major police search with divers scouring the riverPolice have responded to claims of foul play in the Nicola Bulley disappearance as the mystery of the missing dog walker deepens. The disappearance of the mum-of-two has seen a massive investigation centred on the River Wyre in Lancashire. Nicola, 45, from Inskip, was last seen walking her dog by the river at about 9.20am on Friday 27 January, having earlier dropped off her two daughters at school in St Michaels on Wyre. The alarm was raised shortly after a member of the public recognised Nicola's springer spaniel Willow and found her phone on a nearby bench. Partner Paul Ansell was contacted and rushed to the scene before calling police, it is understood.   Superintendent Sally Riley told a press briefing this afternoon that investigators have received thousands of responses to the case and are combing through 500 pieces of information. She added that 14 detectives are working under a senior investigations officer, while six specialist officers are searching the river bank each day. Supt Riley said police are also currently ID'ing 700 vehicles which drove through the area at the time of Nicola's disappearance.  It comes as Lancashire Police this week brought in underwater forensic firm Specialist Group International (SGI) which launched a high tech sonar tracking system into the water.  SGI founder and CEO Peter Faulding has suggested he does not believe Nicola is in the river and that a potential third party was involved in the case. Asked about Mr Faulding's comments, Supt Riley said: ""I thank SGI for the help they've given to the team.   ""Our search has not found Nicola in the river and any re-search done in parts by SGI found the same.  ""That does not mean that Nicola has not been in the river. And in light of other enquiries being discounted from the investigation so far - although we are keeping an open mind to anything new - then clearly our main belief is that Nicola did fall into the river.  ""Clearly Mr Faulding isn't included in all the investigation detail anymore than the members of the public are that I'm briefing through these sorts of press conferences.  ""We would ask that we be allowed time to continue with those enquiries and release to the public only what is relevant.""   The superintendent urged the public to avoid ""distressing"" speculation about what may have happened to Nicola. She told the briefing: ""We would ask that people in the wider community, particularly on social media and online, do not speculate as to what may have happened to Nicola. ""This is particularly hurtful to her family, to her children, to her partner Paul, to her parents, her sister and her friends because it is not helpful to them, it is distressing and it is distracting for the police inquiry.  ""Nor is it helpful if people, particularly if they have come from outside of the area, take it upon themselves to take the law into their own hands by trying to, for example, break into empty property,"" Supt Riley continued. ""They may mean well, they may want to help. But they can help in thinking back if they were in the area to what information they may have of relevance to the police and holding the family in their thoughts. ""But we will not tolerate online abuse of anyone, including innocent witnesses, members of the family and friends, of local businesses, or of criminal damage or burglary. We will be taking a strong line on that, as you would expect.""  Over the last 12 days specialist officers have been trawling the river in small boats and combing through the grass off Garstang Road since - while villagers have also launched their own voluntary search parties. At one point doorbell pictures of Nicola taken as she made her last fateful school run before she disappeared were released by investigators. She can be seen loading up the car before the roughly four mile journey from the family home in Inskip. Dressed in her walking boots, and hooded raincoat, she is seen opening the boot as Willow gets in.  A woman seen wearing a yellow coat and pushing a pram on the day Nicola went missing came forward last weekend following a police appeal for the potential witness. The development came after claims a broken CCTV camera could have hindered the search - as police admitted ""blackspots"" have affected their investigation. Supt Riley previously said the mum-of-two may have fallen into the water while trying to retrieve her dog's ball, but her friends and family have cast doubt on this theory. They say Willow no longer took tennis balls out on walks and Nicola wouldn't have tried to reach in to fish one out of the water.  Police had previously said it was ""very unlikely"" that a third party was involved, but Nicola's family had always urged investigators to keep an ""open mind"". Her parents Ernest and Dot had previously told the Mirror they feared ""someone had got her"" as Nicola's disappearance was totally out of character. Paul said everyone is desperate to know what happened to her. He added that Nicola's daughters ""miss their mummy desperately"" and have been going through ""a tough time"" since her disappearance.

Gran slapped with £100 fine for 'littering' after feeding ducks with ONE slice of bread,"Susan Watson, 68, from Tonbridge, Kent, was stung with a littering ticket after a council officer spotted her scattering a slice of bread for some ducks next to a riverA grandmother was left ""shocked and embarrassed"" after being slapped with a £100 littering fine for feeding ducks. Susan Watson, 68, was stung with a littering ticket after a council officer spotted her scattering a slice of bread for some ducks next to a river. The dementia nurse, from Tonbridge, Kent, was walking along a public pathway which runs along the River Medway on January 31. After absentmindedly tearing up a slice of bread to feed to some ducks, she was approached by an officer from Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council (TMBC) and given a £100 fine for littering. Susan told KentOnline: ""I was so shocked. I remember someone started to run after me shouting 'hello'. He told me I was on camera and that I had committed an environmental infringement. ""There were no crumbs on the pathway and the bread went straight into the water. ""I asked if he could give me a warning but he refused.   ""He went on to say that what I did could be seen as fly-tipping, which is a much bigger offence. It was one slice of bread."" Susan, who has lived in Tonbridge for nearly 20 years, takes the route along the River Medway into the town centre everyday. She added: ""I don't always feed the ducks but that one day I had a slice of crust left and thought it would be nice to. Lots of other people do it including children. ""I suggested to the officer that they should put up some signs. He said that it's all on the council's website. ""I rang the council the same day and the women on the phone asked if I was joking! They also told me they would ring me back, but they never have."" In October last year TMBC announced it was working with a private enforcement company to crackdown on littering across the borough.  The council partnered up with National Enforcement Solutions (NES) - a specialist company which provides ""front-line enforcement"" - in a project named 'No Ifs, No Butts'. The specialist teams have been patrolling towns and villages, keeping an eye out for people discarding rubbish on the street. Those caught dropping litter, including cigarette stubs, could face a fixed penalty of up to £150 - or £100 if paid within 10 days. Susan decided to pay the fine as she was concerned it would increase to the maximum penalty if she left it too long. She said: ""For me to earn £100 is the equivalent of six hours on a night shift. I wouldn't have kicked off as much if it was £30, or if he gave me a warning.  ""I'm so embarrassed, I've never paid a fine in my life before. I've had to take the money out of my pension fund to pay for it."" ""It's madness. Everyone I have told thinks I'm making it up."" The council has since agreed to refund the fine after admitting they had ""got this one wrong"". A spokesman for TMBC told KentOnline: ""We got this one wrong. The enforcement officer from NES considered that dropping what he felt was a large amount of bread into the river justified a penalty. ""However, before this was even brought to our attention, the company had reviewed the case and come to the decision that it was not warranted. ""The penalty has already been refunded and we'd like to apologise to Ms Watson for the error."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/gran-slapped-100-fine-littering-29157534
Moment rapist David Carrick says 'I've been a police officer for 20 years' before arrest,"Shirtless David Carrick can be seen on Hertfordshire Police's bodyworn camera being told by officers they need to search his Stevenage home - he appears unphased at the severity of the situationThis is the moment rapist cop David Carrick is arrested while arrogantly telling police officers he has been on the force for two decades. Shirtless Carrick can be seen on a police bodyworn camera being told by officers they need to search his Stevenage home. The 48-year-old remains brazen and apparently unfazed at the fact police were arresting him after he'd been accused of rape. One officer explains they need to search for ""articles related to the offences in 2020"" and says that ""is the allegation that has been made to us"". In the footage from October 2021, Carrick retorts: ""There is no necessity."" When the officer replies ""yes there is"" Carrick once again shows his arrogance by replying, almost sarcastically: ""I've only been a police officer for 20 years.""   Today, Carrick was sentenced to 30 years and 239 days behind bars after pleading guilty to 24 counts of rape as well as charges of sexual assault, controlling and coercive behaviour and false imprisonment. Carrick's campaign of abuse spanned 17 years and he inflicted some of the most degrading and inhumane sexual violence against a dozen women. He exercised coercive control over his victims by telling them no one would believe them because he was a police officer. Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb told Carrick during sentencing today ""you behaved as if you were untouchable"".  She said he was ""bold and relentless"" and acted on the trust that ""no victim would overcome her shame and fear to report you"". Carrick's crimes were all carried out while serving with the force guarding sites including embassies and the Houses of Parliament and completed training courses, including one on domestic abuse in 2005. Carrick - who appeared in the dock at Southwark Crown Court, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and tie - was told by the judge he was a ""high risk"" offender who posed a ""grave danger"" to women. She said he had only pleaded guilty out of a ""self-pitying reaction to the shame brought on you"" rather than through remorse.  It wasn't until a woman reported Carrick in 2021 for a rape in 2020 that he was arrested and ultimately charged - which led to more victims coming forward. Speaking to Carrick, the judge said: ""For nearly two decades you were proved right. ""Now a combination of 12 women and your police colleagues acting on evidence has exposed you. ""You have lost your liberty, your job and your status. You have before you a difficult time in custody for many years."" She told Carrick that his victims are traumatised after what he put them through.  She said they ""continue to question their judgement and don't trust the police"". However, she hailed the women who came forward and reported Carrick. She said it was ""remarkable"" that one who was driven to come forward led to others. She said: ""Courage calls to courage everywhere and its voice cannot be denied"". Over the two-day sentencing hearing, the court heard how victims were subjected to degrading sexual assaults, forced into cupboards against their will, and spied on from cameras Carrick installed in homes.  Many of the victims said they didn't report the abuse right away because they feared they wouldn't be believed because Carrick was a police officer. One victim said she felt she had ""encountered evil"" that night Carrick attacked her and feared she was going to be killed. Carrick told one of his victims he was “the safest person that she could be with” before he raped her.  He also told another victim he would be the “last thing she saw” as he put his hands around her throat. Carrick, who served in the Army before joining the Met, admitted 49 criminal charges, but some of the attacks are multiple incident counts, meaning they relate to more than 80 sexual offences, including at least 48 rapes against 12 women. He denied a further count of rape in September 2020 relating to a 13th woman, whose allegation triggered the investigation, and the Crown Prosecution Service decided it was not in the public interest to proceed to trial on the charge.  Carrick's crimes are set to form part of the independent inquiry looking at the murder of Sarah Everard, who was raped and strangled by then-serving Met officer Wayne Couzens in March 2021. Police are also calling for other women who think they may have been victims of Carrick to come forward. Hertfordshire Police’s Detective Inspector Iain Moor said: “Our investigation does not stop here, we have set up a special reporting portal to allow people to continue to share information about David Carrick with us. “If anyone else thinks they have been a victim, we still want to hear from you and we will support you."" *For confidential support, call the 24-hour National Domestic Abuse Freephone Helpline on 0808 2000 247 or visit womensaid.co.uk Furthermore, Rape Crisis 24/7 helpline can be contacted at 0808 500 2222, Victim Support 24/7 helpline is on 0808 168 9111, Survivors UK (male victims) can be reached 0203 598 3898, Survivors Trust helpline is on 08088 010818 ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/watch-moment-rapist-cop-david-29156740
Great Yarmouth bomb: Hundreds of homes evacuated after explosive found,"Homes and businesses are currently being evacuated by concerned police after the discovery of a suspected unexploded bomb in Great Yarmouth, NorfolkHundreds of homes have been evacuated by police after an unexploded bomb was found in Great Yarmouth. It was discovered by workers at a construction site earlier today as officers race to clear the area.  Norfolk Police said the discovery in the River Yare was understood to be an ordnance device. Norfolk County Council state the suspected bomb was found by a contractor working on the new river crossing. ""The site team found what they believed to be an unexploded device this morning while excavating in the vicinity of bollard quay,"" they said in a statement.    ""They immediately evacuated the area and called the emergency services. ""Site workers made the discovery while excavating in the area of Bollard Quay"". More than 100 homes are currently being evacuated as police knock on doors to advise residents to leave for their own safety.

A spokesman for the Explosive Ordinance Disposal Team said: ""We currently have a bomb disposal team deployed and are on assist providing their specialist skills and expertise to assist the police in dealing with this matter.""  The coastguard has put a cordon in place by Southgates Road and Newcastle Road across the river. The £121million third river crossing is currently under construction and is expected to be completed later this year. A number of road closures are in place in the area with buses diverted.  In a tweet, Norfolk Police said: ""People are being advised to avoid the Southtown Road area due to an ongoing incident. Part of the road is closed and a 100m cordon is in place.""

Dog owner in tears after huge turnout for border collie's last ever walk on beach,"Sarah Keith, from Hull, has told how she was reduced to tears by the huge turnout by other owners as dozens of dogs shared her border collie Ella's final walk at an East Yorkshire beachA border collie owner was reduced to tears by the ""humility and grace"" by the amazing turnout from other dog lovers who gave her beloved pet a poignant final walk before she had to be put down.  Sarah Keith, 44, from Hull, told how she wanted her 12-year-old dog Ella to have a last trip to her favourite beach with other dogs after being diagnosed with oral cancer. So she posted on social media on Saturday to ask others to join her for the day out at Fraisthorpe beach, East Yorkshire, on Monday.  And she was amazed when more than 30 dogs with their owners greeted her on the sands after her touching message was shared more than 1,200 times. Tearful Sarah said Ella, who also suffered from arthritis, loved charging about with other dogs before she was put to sleep just a few hours later.   She said: “There were people who I’d never met them. You don’t know who they are. But it’s lovely they showed a bit of humility and grace when something like this happens. “The only time I cried was when someone hugged me. There was also a lady that made a hand-stitched keepsake. “And there was a group of people with border collies and Ella loved running with them. At one point there were six or seven going after the same ball. She was the best dog I have ever had, and I have had lots of dogs.” Sarah was told last Friday that a veterinary biopsy had revealed her dog had mouth cancer.  Sarah said she had 11 wonderful years with Ella before the devastating diagnosis and she decided treatment that might be required to prolong her life would only result in further “suffering”.  She added: “It would have been selfish for me to prolong her suffering, just because I didn’t want to say goodbye to her. I thought people who knew her would maybe come down. “Obviously, a lot of people are working on Monday, but I didn’t want to mess anyone around over the weekend. The post just got shared and shared. And I had people from all parts of the country who never were going to be able to make the walk sending me messages. “When I arrived, there was probably more than 30 dogs and in the region of 25 owners. There was even a group with leads on, with not particularly social dogs, but they had wanted to support in their own way.” Sarah said Ella had come to live with her at the age of one after the farmer who first reared her realised she wasn’t going to make a good sheepdog.   The border collie had previously lived in an outdoor kennel, but former RSPCA inspector Sarah realised she would make a good house pet. She said: “This collie was coming up to one year old and she just wouldn’t work sheep for the farmer, so he got another pup, and he was trying to find a home for her. The day after I moved into my house, she moved in with me. ""And as it transpired, when I got her paperwork through, it was actually her first birthday the day she moved in. I sent the farmer a photo of her laid out on the floor.  ""He said: 'What’s she doing there? She’s not a house dog,' and I said: ‘I think you’ll find she is’.""

Exact areas -6C snow bomb will hit UK as Met Office also warns of fog and 75mph gales,"A snow bomb has been predicted to hit the UK over the coming days during a wintry blast where temperatures could dive to -6C and now the Met Office has given its verdictBrits have been told to expect snow and temperatures plummeting to -6C in a wintry blast where there will also be dense fog and 75mph gales.  The Met Office has delivered its verdict on a feared snow bomb this week which has led to local authorities triggering emergency measures.  Forecasters and weather maps have indicated flurries of snow can be expected starting today along with bitterly cold overnight temperatures with the mercury dropping to -6C in the south of the country.  But while there is a Met Office yellow warning of strong winds for Scotland on Wednesday, and people have been told to expect dense fog amid freezing temperatures, there is no alert in place for snow. A Met Office spokesperson reportedly said: “There isn’t a warning out at the moment given there is a bit of uncertainty still with regards to the extent and density of fog patches. But there might be one issued overnight once we start to see things forming and when we have more of an idea about how things are panning out.   “For rush hour morning, they could make for some difficult driving conditions in central and southern areas.”  But despite the Met Office not offering a warning, maps from WXCharts show that there could be two or three inches of snow over the coming days in Scotland. Met Office forecaster Alex Deakin said that after fog on Tuesday: ""We will again get frost and fog in the south overnight.” He said there will be ""dense fog"" during Wednesday's rush hour. ""Temperatures are going to drop fairly steeply this evening, it’s going to be another frosty one where we’ve got these clear skies across the Midlands, much of Wales, southern England, East Anglia, parts of northern England too, and northern Scotland with some clear skies could see a frost for a time,"" said Mr Deakin.  ""As well as the frost in the south, the fog will yet again thicken up and that’s likely to be pretty dense through the early hours and for Wednesday morning’s rush hour.” While temperatures will drop to -3C or -4C in towns and cities, it could get even colder in some parts. “In the countryside in the south it could be down as low as -5C or -6C so a very frosty and very foggy start to Wednesday morning.” said Mr Deakin. He also pointed out the strong winds and snow for Scotland.  “Very, very blustery day here. We do have a yellow Met Office warning in place across the Highlands and parts of the northwest of the mainland. Gusts of 70 perhaps 75mph, and later in the day those winds will be joined by some pretty intense rain,"" said Mr Deakin. “There will be some snow for a time across northern Scotland, mostly over hills.”  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/exact-areas-6c-snow-bomb-29154577
'NHS workers are achieving the impossible and it makes me ashamed to live in this country',"Polly Hudson is so grateful to NHS staff who cared for a loved one in hospital, and she wants to share the incredible, undervalued work going on behind the scenesSomeone I love has died. She’d been in hospital since early December, just as the NHS crisis began to peak – and we know the rest; the ­monumental waits, the often devastating consequences, the terrible state of everything. And that is true, of course, and much, much more. But I want to tell you about another side. What’s going on quietly behind the scenes, against all odds. The care my family member received was exemplary. Consistent. Faultless. She told me so every time I visited. It was one of the last things she ever said tome.  The hospital was like a war zone, the building literally crumbling, there were holes in the faded, peeling grey walls of the wards and corridors.  They were clearly, even to my completely untrained eye, woefully short staffed. And yet in the worst conditions, they somehow provided the very best care. They were gentle, respectful, kind. Calm, efficient, attentive. When they were in the room, they made us feel like they had all the time in the world, that this was their only patient, their number one priority, and yet sometimes, as they left, I couldn’t help but notice them break into almost a gallop, as they had so much to do, so many to help. They achieved the impossible. They treated one of the most important people in my life exactly as I wanted them to be treated. They spoke to her warmly and politely, explained everything they were doing, even when it was unlikely she could hear them any more. And as they extended their compassion to us too, answering difficult questions with empathy, offering tea, you know what I felt? Ashamed. Genuinely ­embarrassed and mortified to live in a country where these ­extraordinary heroes are forced to strike to be paid fairly. Not even well. Just fairly.  The doctors and nurses I’ve recently been around enabled us to just about bear the unbearable.  I’d appreciate this massively even if they were being ­generously compensated, ­treasured, working in swish, comfortable, state-of-the-art premises. That they’re doing it while being so undervalued that they’re having to fight for a living wage, in decrepit buildings, without enough people or resources, fully takes my breath away. I don’t understand how they’re managing it, day in day out, with no end in sight. I can never thank them enough.  I hope even one of them – or any of the NHS workers doing the same up and down the country – sees this and is reminded of the enormous ­difference they make, how much they mean, how grateful so many of us are to them. It’s unlikely though.  Hard to imagine any of them having time to read a paper.",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/nhs-workers-achieving-impossible-makes-29157394
Woman nicknamed 'Miss Piggy' after nose bitten off jailed for threatening Uber driver,"A woman from Salford, Greater Manchester, nicknamed 'Miss Piggy' after her nose was bitten off, has been jailed after threatening to stab an Uber driver with a dirty syringeA woman given the cruel nickname of 'Miss Piggy' after her nose was bitten off has now been jailed for threatening to stab an Uber driver with a dirty syringe.  Louise Dean, 43, jumped into Mohammed Dara's stationary Uber at 2.45am on December 1, 2019. The Salford resident has now been jailed for three years and nine months at Manchester Crown Court after admitting to robbery.  Dean made ""stabbing motions"" towards Dara and ""began to threaten him again with the syringe"". She then ordered him to hand over his cash. The convicted criminal fled with his watch and £30 of cash and later falsely claimed that Dara owed her money for a sexual liaison.  Innocent, Dara has since given up his job and is undergoing therapy for the sex allegations made against him.    Judge John Potter told Dean her smear of Dara was an ""appalling lie."" Following the incident, Dara completed his next fare to Warrington, but subsequently reported the matter to the police and the trip was his last ever fare.  James Worsford, prosecuting said: ""He was about to collect his final fare when he noticed the defendant's car parked up behind his in the street and then saw her get out and walk towards him.  ""She opened the door and got in the victim's stationary vehicle despite his protestations that he already had a pre-arranged booking and that she had to get out. Once in the car she pulled a syringe and started making stabbing motions towards the victim. The victim noticed that the syringe had a metal tip and was dirty. She threatened to stab him if he did not pay her money.""  The attack on Dara occurred as the victim finished a seven-hour shift.  Worsford added: ""The victim managed to get out of his vehicle and initially she remained inside, looking for his earnings. But she then stepped outside the car and started to chase the defendant around the car.  ''The victim suffers from restricted mobility due to his asthma and replacement hip and so was quickly caught up by the defendant. During the chase, the victim's watch came loose and dropped to the floor. It was quickly taken by the defendant.""  Dean has five offences on her record including a conviction for affray in 2018 in which she served an eight-month prison sentence.  In mitigation, her counsel, Thomas James, said: ""In 2021 Ms Dean was subject to a brutal attack by another female, who bit her nose off and was left with permanent facial disfigurement. Her family situation has collapsed and she is no longer welcome among them. Her estrangement meant she has lived in various hostels and temporary accommodation.""  Last year, mum of three Claire Bold, 38, was sentenced to six years for biting off Dean's nose. The judge called the act ""animal savagery."" Since, Dean has claimed she had experienced suicidal thoughts and that people stared at her in the street and called her 'Miss Piggy'. James continued: ""She is currently taking medication for depression and is diagnosed with anxiety. She has suffered much trauma in her life. She doesn't' recall much from the incident that night although she is very upset to hear about what has happened to the victim and feels remorse."" Judge Potter acknowledge that Dean lives a ""chaotic lifestyle"", but added: ""You may express remorse now but in your police interview you told a shocking disgraceful pack of lies designed to further demean your victim."" Dean has five offences on her record, including a conviction for affray from 2018. She served an eight-month prison sentence for the crime.

Mum's plea to missing aristocrat who vanished with baby and sex offender boyfriend,"Virginie de Selliers pledged to stand by Constance Marten and her young grandchild. She wrote an emotional open letter to her as police continue to search for the couple's whereaboutsThe mother of a missing aristocrat who vanished more than a month ago with her newborn baby and convicted sex offender boyfriend has issued an emotional open letter to her daughter. Virginie de Selliers pledged to stand by Constance Marten, 35, and her grandchild, telling her: “You are not alone in this situation.  ""We will support you in whatever way we can.” Constance and her partner Mark Gordon, 48, have been travelling around the UK by taxi since their car was found burning on the M61 in Bolton, Greater Manchester, on January 5. Police believe the couple are sleeping rough in a blue tent and fear for the safety of the baby, which has not had any medical attention since birth in early January. In the letter, Mrs de Selliers writes: ""Open Letter to My Darling Daughter Constance. ""I know you well enough; you are focused, intelligent, passionate and complex with so much to offer the world. So many of your friends have come forward to say such positive things about you, assuring us of their warmest love and support for you and your family.   ""You have made choices in your personal adult life which have proven to be challenging, however I respect them, I know that you want to keep your precious new-born child at all costs. ""With all that you have gone through this baby cannot be removed from you but instead needs looking after in a kind and warm environment. ""I want to help you and my grandchild. You deserve the opportunity to build a new life, establish a stable family and enjoy the same freedoms that most of us have. ""Constance, I will do what I can to stand alongside you and my grandchild. You are not alone in this situation. We will support you in whatever way we can. ""I am ready to do what it takes for you to recover from this awful experience so you can thrive and enjoy motherhood. ""I love you and miss you, Mum xx."" It is the first time that Constance’s mother has said anything publicly about her daughter’s disappearance. The missing couple have so far avoided being traced by the police by moving around frequently and keeping their faces covered in CCTV images.  A £10,000 reward is on offer for information that leads to them being found safe. Investigators said that in the months before they vanished, they built up a significant amount of cash and used it to pay for places to stay and taxis around the country. The couple travelled from Bolton to Liverpool, then to Harwich in Essex, then to east London and then to Newhaven in Sussex, where they were seen near the ferry port on January 8. The Metropolitan Police said it believes the family may be camping in Sussex. Miss Marten, who is from a wealthy aristocratic family, was a promising drama student when she first met Mr Gordon in 2016.  Since then, the couple have led an isolated life, and in September, when Constance was well into her pregnancy, began moving around rental flats.  Gordon served 20 years in prison in the US for rape and battery committed when he was 14. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mums-plea-missing-aristocrat-who-29155459
Widows of Russian fighters killed in Ukraine war given baffling fur coat gifts,"The coats were being given to Russian women whose husbands had been invading the Donbas - in a donation drive organised by the wife of a convicted war criminalWidows of pro-Putin fighters killed in Ukraine are being given fur coats donated by a supplier based in Russia's capital city.  Footage shows how the garments were handed over to the women in Makiivka, in the Russian-occupied Donetsk region. Miroslava Reginskaya, who was organising the donations, said the decision had been made to hand the coats over to women whose husbands had been invading the Donbas.  The coats were going to 21 “widows of our fallen defenders”, the 29-year-old announced. Among the recipients was Natalia Denisyuk, widow of Yury Denisyuk, 35. The women are heard on video giving thanks for the fur coats to Yevgeny Skripnik, an associate of Igor ‘Strelkov’ Girkin. Girkin was a convicted war criminal and former former defence minister of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, who was married to Reginskaya.   One woman said: “We received some unexpected help today. Very grateful. “The families of the dead soldiers gathered here thank you very much from the bottom of our hearts.” The coats were donated by a Moscow fur supplier, it is understood. Skripnik is heard saying: “This help is from the Russian activists of our capital [Moscow].  “Do not forget, even though they are our rear they help us, for all the nine years of this conflict… “At such moments we feel we are one family.” Girkin, 52, is among three convicted on war crimes charges by a Dutch court last year for the downing of a Malaysian Airlines passenger jet in which all 298 on board were killed in 2014.  Despite this, he remains a key voice inside Russia on the conduct of the war, often criticising Vladimir Putin and his commanders for failing to strike Ukraine harder.  This comes as Moscow lawmakers are planning to press-gang unemployed men into fighting on the Ukraine frontline, The Mirror can reveal. The cruel plan will involve hundreds of thousands of jobless male recruits forcibly signing up when they turn up to the dole office. It is the latest plan to boost troop numbers for President Vladimir Putin’s ailing war which has thus far killed 132,160 of Moscow’s soldiers. And it comes as Ukraine is bracing for a major Russian offensive, with 300,000 more of Moscow’s recruits deploying in a few weeks. It follows debates with Moscow’s State Duma lawmakers and the dole-queue to war proposal is being considered by Putin. Currently some 50,000 Wagner Group mercenaries are doing the brunt of the fighting in Ukraine, many of them recruited from prisons.

"Dad found GUILTY of killing daughter, 16, after she grew to 23-stone in lockdown","Kaylea Titford, 16, weighed 22-stone and 13 pounds, with a BMI of 70, at the time of her death in October 2020 = she was found living in conditions described as 'unfit for any animal'A father has been found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence of his teenage daughter who was morbidly obese when she died at the family home. Kaylea Titford, 16, weighed 22-stone and 13 pounds, with a BMI of 70, at the time of her death in October 2020. She was found living in conditions described as “unfit for any animal”, in soiled clothing and bed linen.  When asked during his evidence why he had let his daughter down so badly, Alun Titford said: “I’m lazy.” The removals worker, 45, denied the charges of gross negligence, but today he was found guilty. He was also found guilty of causing or allowing the death of a child.   His partner Sarah Lloyd-Jones, 39, had already pleaded guilty to manslaughter by gross negligence. Kaylea, who had spina bifida and used a wheelchair, died after suffering inflammation and infection from ulceration, arising from obesity and immobility, Mold Crown Court heard.  Emergency service workers, who were called to the house in Powys, Wales after she was found on October 10, described feeling sick due to a “rotting” smell in her room. Following her death maggots were found which were thought to have been feeding on her body, the jury was told. The court heard that her bedsheets were soiled and she was lying on a number of puppy toilet training pads.  Her room was said to be dirty and cluttered, with bottles of urine and a chip fryer with drips of fat down the side, as well as a full cake in a box. The court heard that Kaylea had attended Newtown High School, where she was described as “funny and chatty” by staff, but did not return following the coronavirus lockdown in March 2020. Titford, who had six children with Lloyd-Jones, said the family would order takeaways four or five nights a week. It is thought Kaylea had put on two or three stone since March.  The prosecution alleged that Kaylea had not used her wheelchair, which became too small for her, since the start of lockdown. Caroline Rees KC, prosecuting, asked Titford: “She hadn’t been out of bed, had she?” Titford claimed he saw her in the kitchen in her wheelchair during that period, but later told the police he hadn't seen her out of bed.  The court heard that Kaylea had been discharged from physiotherapy and dietetics services in the years before her death and had last been seen by a social worker at home in 2017. Titford claimed Lloyd-Jones, who was a community care worker, was responsible for looking after Kaylea. He said he used to take her to medical appointments and care for her but stepped back when she reached puberty as he was not “comfortable”. In cross-examination, he accepted he was as much to blame for Kaylea’s death as her mother. Judge Mr Justice Griffiths said: “There can be no doubt this case passes the custody threshold.”  The judge told jurors he would give them a 10-year exemption from jury service, saying there had been a “lot of difficult and a lot of expert evidence”. He added: “The subject matter was, no doubt, unusually distressing.” Detective Chief Inspector Jonathon Rees said: ""The circumstances of Kaylea’s death were tragic, and her parents will have to live with the part they played in that for the rest of their lives. ""This investigation has been extensive, and at times harrowing given Kaylea’s age and the conditions she was living in, yet our officers and partners have worked diligently and professionally throughout. ""I would like to thank them for their efforts, and for getting justice for Kaylea. ""I would also like to thank those who knew Kaylea and members of the community in which she lived for their patience throughout this sensitive investigation."" Titford and Lloyd-Jones will be sentenced on March 1 at Swansea Crown Court. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-dad-found-guilty-killing-29155724
Archie Battersbee's mum reveals moment she screamed after finding unconscious son,"Archie Battersbee's life support was withdrawn on August 6 last year after his parents, Hollie Dance and Paul Battersbee, failed in bids to overturn a High Court rulingArchie Battersbee's mother believes her son died after accidentally falling from the banister at their home and suffering a neck injury, an inquest heard today. The 12-year-old's life support was withdrawn on August 6 last year after his parents, Hollie Dance and Paul Battersbee, failed in bids to overturn a High Court ruling that doctors could lawfully do so. Judges were told Ms Dance found Archie unconscious with a ligature over his head at home in Southend, Essex, on April 7 last year. On the first day of an inquest into his death in Chelmsford, a tearful Ms Dance told of finding her son unresponsive by their staircase before running outside and screaming for help. She said: ""I was crying hysterically, I was saying 'please don't leave mummy, I love you little man'.   ""I repeated that over and over, I just didn't want him to leave me."" Asked by Essex's senior coroner Lincoln Brookes how she thinks her son died, Ms Dance replied: ""I think he climbed on the banister and probably fell, causing serious injury to his neck, resulting in unconsciousness."" She said her belief is that Archie's death was an ""accident"". Ms Dance also set out that Archie was the ""apple of my eye"", ""well-loved"" and ""protected"".  She said Archie was affected by the separation of herself and his father, that he endured bullying at school and was taken out of mainstream education. Archie was a lover of gymnastics and mixed martial arts (MMA) with his first fight, which he was ""looking forward to"", scheduled for weeks after his death, the inquest heard. Ms Dance added that Archie ""thought he was the next Spider-Man"" and would often climb on things. Family members said ""he wasn't down, just a bit bored"" in the weeks before he died, Ms Dance told the hearing.  The coroner asked Ms Dance if she was aware Archie had been expressing thoughts of self-harm and suicide, to which she replied: ""no"". Mr Brookes went on: ""The police found he had shared some thoughts with others online or in a WhatsApp group. How were you when you read that?"" Ms Dance said: ""Heartbroken, very surprised... if there were any marks on his body I would have seen them."" Doctors treating Archie at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, east London, thought he was brain-stem dead and said continued life-support treatment was not in his best interests.  Ms Dance has previously said he may have been taking part in an online challenge, and he suffered brain damage. On Tuesday, she told the inquest: ""I still don't know if Archie was trying the blackout challenge on April 7 or before, I still don't know what he was watching on TikTok."" She added: ""He hated bullying and loud shouting. I can see that he might possibly be influenced, even though he knew right from wrong, if that's what peers and social media were telling him to do so. I fear that's what was prompted.""  Mr Brookes said at a preliminary inquest hearing in November last year he had seen no evidence that Archie was taking part in any online blackout challenge but had been told that police found messages on the youngster's phone reflecting ""very low mood"". At the outset of the hearing, Mr Brookes offered his ""deep condolences"". He said the topics the inquest will cover include Archie's medical cause of death and his ""state of mind and his intentions on April 7 2022"". The inquest continues.

Serving Met Police officer charged with rape and three counts of actual bodily harm,"PC Jorden Brown, a serving Metropolitan Police office with the Central East Command Unit, has been charged with rape and three counts of actual bodily harm, with the offences relating to one victimA serving Metropolitan Police officer has been charged with rape and assault. PC Jorden Brown, attached to the Central East Command Unit, was charged by postal requisition on Friday, 6 January, with rape and three counts of actual bodily harm.  He is now due to attend Barkingside Magistrates' Court this Wednesday. The offences are alleged to have occurred between November, 2018, and February, 2019, and they relate to one victim, who was known to him.  They are alleged to have occurred while he was off-duty.   The offences were reported to police in October 2019 and an investigation was then launched.  The police officer has been suspended from duty, the force has stated. Detective Superintendent Dan Rutland, from Central East Command Unit, said: ""PC Brown has been suspended and criminal proceedings will now follow.  ""While I recognise the inevitable strength of public feeling, is important that nothing is said that will put those proceedings at risk.""",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/serving-met-police-officer-charged-29156252
How cop David Carrick was unmasked as one of Britain's most prolific sex offenders,"David Carrick has been sentenced to 30 years and 239 days in prison after attacking a dozen woman over a 17-year period - but warning signs had been posted continually about the serving policeman's behaviourConstable David Carrick gave the outward appearance of an officer who was a credit to the force. Dependable, reliable and trusted to the point where he could be armed and placed on the most high profile of duties. At the pinnacle of a police career spanning two decades, Carrick served in what is now the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command, providing an armed policing presence at parliamentary, government and diplomatic premises. And yet throughout a working life spent supposedly in the service of his country either in the police or army, Carrick preyed on a host of victims, subjecting women to the most vile, degrading sexual abuse, violence and threats. He believed - and told them - his position as a policeman meant he was beyond reproach, untouchable, exempt from the law. And shockingly, for the most part, he was right. Time and again, despite warning bells being sounded over his behaviour, Carrick's superiors dismissed allegations against him, giving him the green light to continue in uniform - and free rein to visit misery on further victims. His coercive controlling behaviour was facilitated by being able to tell the women that he abused that no-one in authority would believe them against him. In effect, he WAS the law. Ultimately however the bravery of Carrick's victims ensured the authorities had to mount a proper investigation which finally saw him given life in prison with a minimum sentence of 30 years and 239 days for attacking a dozen women. Carrick ultimately pleaded guilty to 24 counts of rape as well as charges of sexual assault, controlling and coercive behaviour and false imprisonment, with Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb telling the disgraced policeman ""you behaved as if you were untouchable"".   The Met was forced to apologise and admit Carrick should have been rooted out earlier after it emerged he came to police attention over nine incidents - including allegations of rape, domestic violence and harassment - between 2000 and 2021, with all but one of the incidents relating to his behaviour towards women. Carrick faced no criminal sanctions or misconduct findings and police chiefs across England and Wales have since been asked to have all officers checked against national police databases by the end of March. Below we detail how Carrick flew the under the radar.  Carrick's mum says he 'changed' after an allegation against him  Last month Jean Carrick revealed she had previous concerns with Carrick when he was a teenager.  She that Carrick has been ""normal-ish"" while growing up and that he did ""fairly well"" at school.  She also said that he brought ""so many"" girls home that she eventually stopped asking about them because he ""used to change them quite a lot"".  But she also recalled reporting Carrick after a serious allegation was made about him. “After that, he changed,” Jean, who hasn't had contact with Carrick in about 15 years, told The Guardian: “He just sort of kept himself to himself and away from the family. And that’s when I had my two other children. After leaving the family home, Carrick worked in a local supermarket before joining the army at 19 years old, where he served in the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiments. His mother, from Salisbury, said she thought he could have joined ""because he wanted to carry a weapon"". Carrick served in the British Army from 1996 until 1997.  Carrick becomes suspect in two offences in 2000  Carrick was reported to the Met police involving allegations of malicious communications and burglary against a former partner after he refused to accept the end of their relationship. He was not arrested and no further action was taken.   Carrick accused of harassment and assault during his probation period with the Met  Carrick joined the Met in 2001 and in 2002 he was accused of harassment and assault against a former partner. He was not arrested by the force and no further action is taken. The matter was not referred to the Directorate of Professional Standards.  Carrick goes on to rape the first and second victims  In 2003, Carrick raped his first known victim and in 2004, he raped another woman. A woman who was raped in 2003 said in a victim impact statement that she felt she had ""encountered evil"". In a statement read out at Southwark Crown Court, she said: ""That night I felt I had encountered evil. For the past 19 years, I’ve been lost in my own life mainly due to this one event. ""I distinctively remember his words: 'Come on, you can trust me, I am the safest person you can be around, I am a police officer.'  ""I honestly thought he was going to kill me that night. I thought he was going to rape me and kill me and that my life would be over."" In 2004, Carrick was involved in a domestic incident but no criminal allegations were made to the police. He was not arrested and the matter was not referred to the Directorate of Professional Standards.  Carrick carries out multiple rapes of a woman between 2006 and 2009  The woman was abused and threatened with violence. In 2009, Carrick was transferred to what is now the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command. In this role, he provided an armed policing presence at parliamentary, government and diplomatic premises.  Hertfordshire Police receive a domestic abuse report  In the same year, Hertfordshire Police received a domestic abuse report from a third party involving Carrick. Neither party makes a complaint and no charges were brought. Hertfordshire did inform Metropolitan Police of the complaint. Carrick carried out another assault on a woman who he met after a social evening.  Within the same year, he sexual assaulted another woman after sharing a hotel room following a social event. A few months later, he invited another woman to his home where he became aggressive and subsequently raped her. In 2015, Carrick raped another woman. In 2016, he repeatedly raped a woman who said he controlled her. One of the victim impact statements read out in court detailed how Carrick decided what she ate and what she wore.  She said: ""He began controlling and limiting my friends, family, and relationships...Sometimes he was so aggressive during sex and he would hit me in my head; I actually thought I might die. I had less and less energy to defend myself when I was forced to have sex. Mentally I was exhausted."" She added: ""I slowly learned what he expected from me and how I could make my life easier. ""I felt trapped, I couldn’t see an escape and he made me feel like I had no one.""  Carrick passes vetting in 2017  At this point, Carrick had had complaints lodged against him and later dropped without arrest at least four times between 2002 and 2016. In 2016, he became a suspect in the Hampshire Police investigation following an allegation of harassment. He was not arrested and the inquiry was later closed. He was re-vetted and passed.  In the same year, Thames Valley Police spoke to him after he was thrown out of a nightclub for being drunk.  He was not arrested and the matter was not referred to the Met.  Carrick continued to carry out his campaign of violence, sexually assaulting two more women in 2017 and another in 2018. A woman who was subjected to coercive and controlling behaviour, false imprisonment, rape and sexual assault between 2017 and 2019 said she was locked naked in a cupboard. In her victim impact statement, she said: ""I was whipped, urinated on and locked naked in a cupboard. At times, I was made to sleep naked on the floor. My chest was sat on; I was strangled, kicked, and threatened."" She added: ""I was too frightened to go to the police to lodge a complaint as the defendant had drilled it into me that 'he was the police; he was the law; and he owned me'. ""I was convinced the police would not believe me and would not investigate my complaint. I was terrified of making myself a target, so I remained silent.""  Hertfordshire Police receive another complaint about Carrick  In 2019, Hertfordshire Police received a third-party report of an assault and criminal damage involving an argument between Carrick and a woman during a domestic incident. He was said to have grabbed her by the neck. Neither party was supportive of police involvement and no further action was taken after the case was looked at by the domestic abuse unit. It was also referred to the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards and Carrick was given words of advice in relation to informing his chain of command about off-duty incidents. It was then determined he has no case to answer in relation to misconduct.   A woman comes forward after she is attacked  In 2021, A woman reported she was raped by Carrick in 2020. He was arrested by Hertfordshire Police over the allegation but no further action was taken after she withdraws the complaint. The Met's Directorate of Professional Standards was made aware and Carrick was placed on restricted duties. However, it was determined he had no case to answer in relation to any misconduct and in September the restriction was lifted, although he never returned to full duties. Later in the same year, another woman reported she was raped by Carrick and this time he was arrested, charged and suspended by the Met. He appeared in court in October 2021 and was remanded in custody after appearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court charged with rape. Between October 2021 and October 2022, another 12 women came forward with allegations against Carrick. He pleaded guilty in December 2022 to 43 offences and in January 2023 admitted a further six charges. Carrick was sacked by the Met the same month.  *For confidential support, call the 24-hour National Domestic Abuse Freephone Helpline on 0808 2000 247 or visit womensaid.co.uk Furthermore, Rape Crisis 24/7 helpline can be contacted at 0808 500 2222, Victim Support 24/7 helpline is on 0808 168 9111, Survivors UK (male victims) can be reached 0203 598 3898, Survivors Trust helpline is on 08088 010818  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/how-cop-david-carrick-unmasked-29155084
Depop customer horrified after clothes order arrives packaged in dirty 75p crisp packet,"The Jack's Burger Bites bag, which still displayed the snack's price and contained crumbs, was used as an envelope, which Depop shoppers described as 'zero waste gone too far'A Depop buyer thought they'd bagged themselves a bargain - before it arrived in second-hand packaging with the clothing item inside. The customer was shocked after their order arrived in the greasy crisp packet, which still had oily crisp crumbs inside. But after complaining to the seller, they were quick to find out the 75p Jack's Burger Bites packaging has simply been the well-intentioned efforts of an eco-warrior. The bizarre packaging arrived with the buyer's addressed taped to the snack packet after buying an undisclosed item on the second-hand shopping app. What followed was a hilarious conversation in which the two came to blows, prompting the Depop seller to snap back saying people ""always have something to complain about"".   The buyer said, ""you sent me it in a crisp packet?"" adding ""it's literally got crumbs and flavouring all stuck on it"". ""Did you not have anything else to send it in? ""I feel like it's just common sense to at least use something clean."" The seller seemed shocked at the messages they had received, and replied: ""I'm sorry but what did you expect? ""This is a used clothing selling website? ""This is exactly why I refrain from selling on this silly app, people like you always have something to complain about.""  Many shoppers found humour in the exchange and slammed the seller for taking zero-waste too far. One customer, called Rena said: ""Bet that smells awesome though."" ""Could have at least used a skips bag,"" Ruben added. Another shopper said: ""Zero waste has gone too far."" Someone else added: ""'Sustainability"" followed by an emoji with its tongue out. However, shopper Jodi said: ""Not even Sensations."" ""Reduce reuse recycle hun,"" joked another. One person called Fred said: ""Depop has just become the postman's worst nightmare."" It comes after another Depop user complained when their order similarly came in second-hand packaging earlier this month. The jumper arrived wrapped in a Waitrose toilet roll bag, leading the customer to question the bizarre recycling attempt.

Thousands of struggling households can get up to £650 in free cash – how to claim,"The money is available through the Government's Household Support Fund which gave local councils a cut of £421million to help households struggling the most with the cost of livingHouseholds in certain areas of the UK could be able to claim free cash worth up to £650 to help with the rising cost of living.  The money is available through the Government's Household Support Fund which gave local councils a cut of £421million to help households struggling the most.  Each council gets a different amount of funding depending on its size, population and need, and each local authority decides how they spend their pot of cash. The majority of councils are using the funding to help households who are on benefits or have a low income.  If you live in Manchester, the local council is giving eligible households up to £650 in free cash to help with living costs.   According to Manchester council's criteria, you are eligible to get the full £650 if you claim Housing Benefit and no other Department for Work and Pension (DWP) or HMRC benefits.  You also can't have received the Government's £650 Cost of LIving payment last year.  Manchester residents who received Council Tax Support on November 17 last year and have at least five people living in their home on that day are able to receive a free payment of £400.  You can also get a payment of £326 or £324 if you didn't get the first Cost of Living payment in July but have since become entitled to Pension Credit or Universal Credit.  You can also claim this amount if you live in a park home, houseboat, or off-grid and did not qualify for the £400 Energy Bill Support Scheme payment. If you think you are eligible to claim this help then you can apply through Manchester Council's website but you will need to do it quickly as you only have until March 31 to apply. Other areas are also offering support like this, residents of Exeter can claim a payment of £650 and those living in Harrow can get £300.

Cops spoke to Epsom College head's husband 3 days before he 'killed wife and daughter',"Surrey Police, which has launched a murder investigation, said a firearm licensed to George Pattison was recovered from the scene, and that he had been in contact with them last ThursdayA husband found dead with his headteacher wife and their seven-year-old daughter had spoken to police three days before allegedly killing them in a suspected double-murder suicide. George Pattison, 39, was found dead with his wife Emma, 45, and their daughter Lettie at their home in the grounds of Epsom College in Surrey on Sunday. Surrey Police confirmed that the deaths are being treated as a murder investigation. The force said a firearm licensed to Mr Pattison was recovered from the scene, but cause of death would not be confirmed until post-mortems have been completed later this week. Police said it had been in contact with Mr Pattison last Thursday after he notified officers of a change in address. The force has subsequently referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).  The force added the firing range at the school did not form part of the crime scene and was not a line of inquiry in the investigation. A police statement said: ""We had contact with George on Thursday, February 2 after he notified us of a previous change of address, as is routine.  ""Due to the short period of time between that contact and this incident, we have made a referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.""  The IOPC said it is assessing the information available to decide if any further action is necessary.  Detective Chief Inspector Kimball Edey, senior investigating officer on the case, said: ""This is an incredibly traumatic incident and we are working around the clock to investigate and understand the exact circumstances which led to this point.  ""We understand the public concern and upset, and we will clarify what we can, when we can, while respecting the right to a level of privacy for the families of those who have lost their lives."" Mr Pattison had held a gun licence for a number of years and it was up for renewal early last year, according to the Times.  The newspaper said he had not been reported to Surrey Police before, but in 2016 had contacted them to allege that his wife had hit him, before withdrawing the claim. The latest developments come after Emma's former colleagues paid tribute to their ""dear friend"", saying they are ""immensely shocked and saddened"" by the news of her death.  Speaking on behalf of Ms Pattison's former workplace Croydon High School, Cheryl Giovannoni said: ""We are immensely shocked and saddened by the news about the death of Emma Pattison, her daughter Lettie and her husband George. ""Our thoughts are with their family at this time, as well as everyone at Croydon High School, and Epsom College, which Emma joined as head in September 2022. ""Emma was a much loved and respected member of the GDST community, as well as a talented head and teacher and a dear friend to many of us. ""She touched the lives of all of us with her energy, wisdom and kindness during her six years as head of Croydon High School and the school will always bear the legacy of her inspiring leadership.  ""We are taking time to support staff and students at Croydon High School as well as everyone in the GDST family, and their wellbeing will be our priority in the coming days."" And nursery worker Chloe Rathbone, who previously took care of Lettie, said she was ""utterly heartbroken"" over the young child's death. The 27-year-old told The Times: ""I knew Emma, George and Lettie and I am utterly heartbroken over this news."" She added: ""Lettie was perfect in every way."" Local MP Chris Grayling called the deaths ""an appalling tragedy"", adding: ""I know everyone locally will be shocked about what has happened.""  Epsom College said on Twitter that staff and pupils would pay their respects to their ""wonderful head"" Mrs Pattison. The school said: ""The shocking and tragic news has now reached many about the death of our head, Emma Pattison. ""The College community will be coming together today to process the news, grieve and pay our respects to a wonderful head. ""We will be in close contact with Surrey Police over the coming weeks and months. ""We hope everyone will respect the privacy of Emma's family at this time and allow the College's pupils, staff and wider community the time and space necessary to come to terms with this loss.""",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-police-spoke-epsom-college-29154176
Teenager fined just £61 for burning £1million barn to the ground in arson attack,"A teenager, now 16, has admitted he was ""very stupid and reckless"" after causing a fire at a barn in Eynsham, Oxfordshire, that led to £1million of damage, and he received a fine of just £61A teenage arsonist has been fined just £61 for sparking a devastating fire at a barn causing more than £1 million of damage. The boy, now aged sixteen, who can't be named for legal reasons, admitted starting the blaze at a barn near Eynsham, Oxfordshire, on October 24th, 2021. Oxford Youth Court gave him a four-month referral order and told him to pay £61 in costs after he admitted a single charge of arson. The cost of the damage – covered by insurers - was put at more than £1m, with farm machinery and tonnes of hay destroyed. The teenager told the court: ""I just look back on it as a very stupid and reckless thing and I know that and have admitted that. I’m just very glad that no one was hurt.""   Then aged 15, he handed himself in within weeks of the blaze. District Judge Kamlesh Rana demanded to know why it had taken so long to get the case to court. ""It should have been dealt with, in my opinion, a long time ago – nearer the time it happened – and it should have been dealt with by way of an out of court disposal, to give you the opportunity to get on with the rest of your life,"" said the judge. The court heard that the boy and two friends had been out playing when they got past a locked gate and into Acre Hill Farm, near the A40 north of Eynsham. They entered the barn, where the boy played with a lighter, using it to set light to pieces of straw. More than 40 firefighters from two counties battled to control the flames and it took around 10 days for the scene to be made safe, the court heard.  The judge told him: ""This is your chance to put this behind you, to do the work that’s agreed between you, your mum and the members of the referral order panel and to make sure you do that work yourself if it involves reparations."" As well destroying the barn - owned by a farmer in his 70s - cattle had to be evacuated but no one was injured and all the livestock survived. Investigating officer PC Cory Fastnedge said: ""This incident caused untold damage to the farm building and the victim suffered immeasurable loss as a result of this boy’s reckless actions. ""The case was sent to the CPS at the end of May 2022 following an extensive review by the Youth Offending Team.  ""The CPS deemed this suitable for an out of course disposal; however, the Youth Offending Team and the officer in charge deemed that this was not suitable due to the nature of the offence, the value of the damage, and the devastating effect that this had on the victim. ""This caused delays in getting the case to court while further interviews and extensive reviews were carried out. This incident happened due to an extremely reckless act by the defendant that caused extensive damage. ""He can count himself very fortunate not to have received a more significant sentence, but we respect the judgement and hope that the boy can learn from his reckless actions and ensure there is no repeat in the future. ""The victim lost not only a vast amount of machinery and farm equipment, but this also badly affected his livelihood, and he is still recovering from what happened.  ""Tackling rural crime will remain a top priority of Thames Valley Police and we will not hesitate in bringing charges to court.""

Vladimir Putin to force unemployed Russian men into fighting in brutal Ukraine war,"The Russian plan is the latest to boost troop numbers for President Vladimir Putin’s ailing war which has thus far killed 132,160 of Moscow’s soldiers in UkraineMoscow lawmakers are planning to press-gang unemployed men into fighting on the Ukraine frontline, The Mirror can reveal. The cruel plan will involve hundreds of thousands of jobless male recruits forcibly signing up when they turn up to the dole office. It is the latest plan to boost troop numbers for President Vladimir Putin’s ailing war which has thus far killed 132,160 of Moscow’s soldiers. And it comes as Ukraine is bracing for a major Russian offensive, with 300,000 more of Moscow’s recruits deploying in a few weeks. Russia’s largely-male unemployed amount to 2.7 million with an average age of 36, collecting a maximum benefit of £57 a-week, limited to just one year. It follows debates with Moscow’s State Duma lawmakers and the dole-queue to war proposal is being considered by Putin. Currently some 50,000 Wagner Group mercenaries are doing the brunt of the fighting in Ukraine, many of them recruited from prisons.   Moscow’s officials are keen now to avoid sending qualified engineers and skilled workers to the frontline as they can help the ailing economy. Russia analyst Bruce Jones said: “This plan, if you put aside the immoral nature of this - and these lawmakers will have done just that - it would solve some problems for Russia’s recruiting heads. “It will put those without a job to the frontline and they will be treated as expendable since Moscow shows no sign of compassion for the numbers killed. “However many of those who will be sent will likely turn out to be unsuitable, as in too old to enlist and fight and that will cause problems.”  Putin’s earlier mobilisation of civilians and ill-trained recruits has sparked waves of complaints from firms demanding their employees be returned. The country’s Prosecutor General Igor Krasnov has already warned Putin 9,000 men were wrongly and illegally mobilised and had been returned to their families. Many were in poor health and could barely walk. On Tuesday Russian shelling hit more civilian targets in Ukraine, starting a fire at a town hospital and damaging five apartment buildings. The shelling in the northeastern town of Vovchansk caused multiple fires including at its two-story municipal hospital.  Emergency crews evacuated eight civilians from the site before putting out the blaze, which caused no casualties, authorities said. Vovchansk is in the Kharkiv region, which was occupied by Russia after its full-scale invasion began on Feb. 24 and subsequently retaken by Ukraine during a late summer counteroffensive. The anticipated Russian push may seek to recapture territory Moscow lost in that counteroffensive. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putin-force-unemployed-russian-29155767
Charles Bronson brags ‘I’m coming home’ after getting public parole hearing date,"Charles Bronson's parole hearing will take place on March 6 and March 8. It will take place in public after his request was granted last yearNotorious prisoner Charles Bronson will face a public parole hearing next month when he makes his latest bid for freedom. The Parole Board has confirmed the latest case review of one of the UK's longest-serving prisoners, to decide whether he should remain behind bars, will take place on Monday, March 6 and continue on Wednesday, March 8. An application by Bronson's lawyers to request the hearing takes place in public was granted last year. Dubbed one of Britain's most violent offenders, Bronson, who changed his surname to Salvador in 2014 after the artist Salvador Dali, has been in prison for much of the last 50 years, often spending time in solitary confinement or specialist units. It is believed he is still being held at high-security HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. Bronson was first sent to jail in 1968 and has held 11 hostages in nine different sieges - with victims including governors, doctors, staff and, on one occasion, his own solicitor.   According to the Metro, Bronson wrote to his ‘long-lost son’, paparazzi photographer George Bamby, Bronson.  He wrote: ""We’ve been waiting a long time for this. What will be will be now. ""I’ve worked hard to get a result, I’ve earned my freedom or at least some serious progression.  ""Keep the faith George, I’m coming home."" He was sentenced in 2000 to a discretionary life term with a minimum of four years for taking a prison teacher at HMP Hull hostage for 44 hours.  Since then the Parole Board has repeatedly refused to direct his release. Bronson was the first prisoner to formally ask for a public hearing after rules changed last year to allow the public and press to observe proceedings in a bid to remove the secrecy around the parole process. Russell Causley, who murdered his wife, Carole Packman, in the 1980s and never disclosed where he hid her body, made legal history in December when he became the first prisoner to face a public hearing. The Parole Board has since ruled he can be freed from jail after breaching his licence conditions in 2021 following his initial release a year earlier. So far no other requests for public parole hearings have been granted. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/charles-bronson-brags-im-coming-29156441
"Boy, 6, who shot teacher tried to choke colleague 'until she couldn't breath'","Abby Zwerner, a teacher at Richneck Elementary School in Virginia, US, was shot at a reading table in her classroom after a 6-year-old boy stashed a gun into his backpackA six-year-old boy who shot his teacher tried to choke her colleague ""until she couldn't breath"", it is claimed.  Diane Toscano, lawyer for teacher Abby Zwerner, 25, alleges the student constantly swore at staff and students at Richneck Elementary School in Virginia, US, and tried to use his belt to hit them. He also allegedly chocked another teacher ""until she couldn't breathe"", according to her lawsuit. And just two days before the child shot Ms Zwerner the boy ""slammed"" her mobile phone and broke it. He was given a one-day suspension and allowed to return the following day where he returned to the school with a 9mm handgun which he took from his mum.  He hid the gun in his backpack and shot at her while she sat at a reading table, according to her lawyer.    The child would also stick his middle finger up to members of the class and during one incident bumped “into a classmate while running around the class” and then pushed the student to the floor. She wrote an email to then-Principal Briana Foster Newton and then-Assistant Principal Ebony Parker in October expressing her concerns with the child. Ms Zwerner said: ""As of today, I do not feel comfortable with him returning to my classroom today…”  The principal suggested a meeting with the boy's dad to discuss his “behavioural difficulties” and “put some things in place to support” for the pupil, according to an email on November 22.  Ms Toscano also claims just hours before the shooting there were three teachers and staff members who warned school officials of the gun in the school. It is claimed Ms Zwerner visited the former Assistant Principal Ebony Parker's office at 11.15am to ""to advise her that the shooter seemed more 'off' than usual and was in a violent mood.""  She said the boy had threatened to physically attack a student and ""angrily stared down"" a school security officer. The boy's backpack was searched but no gun was found as officials let the child continue his class and did not inform police or lockdown the school. The claim states: ""Assistant Principal Parker should have called police, instead she did not follow proper protocol and chose to do absolutely nothing."" Ms Zwerner’s lawyer Diane believes school officials were warned of the boy carrying a gun but nothing was done after they were allegedly warned three times on the day of the shooting.  She said the teacher plans to sue the school district over the “entirely preventable” shooting. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/boy-6-who-shot-teacher-29152789
'I'm not here to write what the government wants and their feel-good stories',"Rachel Charlton-Dailey, Disabled Britain guest editor and columnist for the Mirror, says she refuses to simply write whatever the government asks her to, after questioning a new 'announcement' from WestminsterThis weekend the Department for Levelling Up Housing and Communities (DLUHC) had an exciting announcement about new changing places toilets. They’re pledging £7 million to create better toilets and changing facilities for disabled people across England. This is of course great news, but that’s not how the story came to me. Let me take you back to Wednesday for a tale of twists and turns - and the odd Tory villain or two. Let’s start with the email that I received on Wednesday morning (February 1) from a press officer at the DLUHC. “I wondered if you might be interested in an announcement we have coming up this Saturday for your column in the Mirror.  ""We’ll be announcing (embargoed until Saturday morning) £30m for changing places toilets for severely disabled people in the areas they need it the most.” I had two immediate thoughts here.    Had they read the piece where I trashed the Department for Levelling Up for forgetting the North East and Disabled people?  This doesn’t sound like a new announcement - that’s because it wasn’t. It was from the now-deemed unlawful National Disability Strategy in 2021.  I was also told that Undersecretary Dehenna Davison was free for an interview.  It’s worth noting that Davison is the MP for Bishop Auckland in the North East. Was it a coincidence I was being offered her? I didn’t think so. So I asked the press officer if this was the same thing that had been announced in the strategy. I also asked if there was anything else being announced that will benefit disabled people. In response, I was told: “The Minister would be v happy to answer these all, would you like to interview her for a piece?” I, of course, said yes, and emails were exchanged confirming it, where I again asked for clarification but received nothing. It was at 4pm the next day that our first big twist came: “Bad news I’m afraid – Dehenna no longer has any availability for an interview.”  That’s right, after offering me the email and confirming the time previously, the minister now suddenly wasn’t available to talk about their own announcement. A bit convenient after I started asking questions and poking holes in the announcement, but I’m sure she’s very busy. When asked if this was from the previously announced National Disability Strategy, they simply responded “yes”. But wait for it… In response to being asked if anything else was being announced that will benefit disabled people I was told: “Please find attached a link to the govt’s disability strategy.” That’s right, they linked me to the aforementioned now-illegal strategy.  However, there were nine Levelling up pledges in the NDS, of which only Changing Places had been stuck to. This included accessible housing, ensuring the safety of disabled people in emergencies, inaccessible transport, inclusive playground and making high streets more accessible. So I was obviously going to point that out and ask if they were also announcing those too. Looking into Changing Places, I also realised this was the second allocation of the 30million Levelling Up funding, with 23.5m already being given out in 2021/22. So the actual figure, 6.5m, stood at almost five times less than what they’d told me. The next morning, they finally sent me the press release and notes, which announced that 64 councils would receive a share of £7m funding to build 120 new Changing Places toilets.  They went on to tell me that the 6.5m had been rounded up to 7m, and it would fund 120 new toilets, which was actually closer to 700 - in case I couldn’t do the maths myself. I was waiting with bated breath for their response to me listing all the pledges in the National Disability Strategy, but wasn’t prepared for the absolute whiplash I was about to receive: “DWP lead on overall disability strategy.” Yes, after linking me to the NDS, the Department of Levelling Up then refused to answer questions about it.  I asked them to clarify this twice, without somehow typing “WTF?!”, and I’m still yet to get a reply. On Saturday came the announcement - and here’s the thing, the changing places toilets announcement is good news. However, the way they tried to present it as five times higher than it was whilst pedalling it as something new, makes it very suspicious.  Especially to a columnist who had slated their department the week before. This is disabled people’s lives the Tories continuously play with, not a story to plant in an, at times, ridiculous column.  So I won’t be celebrating that it’s taken two years for them to enact one pledge, least of all from an illegal report. Hopefully, this will teach the Tory party that journalists and columnists report on the things that are important and analyse them in ways that matter to our audience.  As a disability rights journalist, I have a whole community that relies on my reporting. We’re not here to write about their feel-good stories and we certainly won’t write what they tell us to.

"Turkey earthquake: Dad holds hand of dead daughter, 15, crushed beneath rubble","More than 5,000 people have now died and hundreds of buildings have been razed to the ground, in the aftermath of one of the deadliest natural disasters this centuryA heartbreaking image from an earthquake-stricken city in Turkey shows a grieving father holding the hand of his dead daughter lying under the rubble of a razed apartment block.  The devastating picture has emerged after two major earthquakes struck southern Turkey and northwestern Syria on Monday, followed by a third quake with a magnitude of 5.7 on Tuesday morning. More than 5,000 people have now died and hundreds of buildings have been razed to the ground, in the aftermath of one of the deadliest natural disasters this century. People are trapped under the rubble where they are at risk of death from injuries, cold or hunger.  A photo from the city of Kahramanmaras, near the epicentre of the quake, shows dad Mesut Hancer holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter.  She lies dead on a bed which is largely buried on in the rubble and not able to be extracted.    WHO has warned the death toll from the earthquakes could hit 20,000 and warned 23 million people - including 1.4m children - could be affected. UNICEF has warned that thousands of children may have been killed in Turkey and Syria. Turkey’s vice president, Fuat Oktay, said on Tuesday that 3,419 people had been killed, with a further 20,534 injured.  The number of confirmed deaths in Syria rose to 1,602, bringing the death toll in both countries to 5,021. Turkey’s disaster management agency said it had 11,342 reports of collapsed buildings, of which 5,775 had been confirmed. Making a statement in the Commons, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly confirmed that three British nationals are missing and a further 35 are affected. He did not specify whether they were in Syria or Turkey. He said: ""We know that three British nationals are missing and the Foreign Office's Crisis Response Hub is working to support the at least 35 British nationals who have been directly affected by these earthquakes.  ""We assess that the likelihood of large-scale British casualties remains low."" Cleverly said more than 6,000 buildings have collapsed and electricity and gas infrastructure has been severely damaged. He said many of the 3.5 million Syrian refugees hosted by Turkey reside in the affected provinces and that the country is requesting international assistance ""on a scale that matches the enormity of the situation that they are facing"".   Meanwhile, footage has emerged from Syria showing a baby girl taking her first breath surrounded by destruction, after her mother went into labour during the quake. A miracle baby who was born under the rubble of collapsed buildings in Afrin, in the northeast of the country, has devastatingly been made an orphan as her parents did not make it out alive. Little is known about the newborn baby and its now-deceased family, aside from reports they had already been displaced by Syria’s brutal war from Deir Ezzor to Afrin, some seven hours away.

Britain's loneliest island 260 miles out at sea where 3 men attempt to survive,"A three-man team is hoping to raise £50,000 for charity by surviving for a week on Rockall, 260 miles west of the Outer Hebrides and the weather conditions will be key for successA three-man team is bidding to survive a week on a rock, dubbed Britain's loneliest outpost, 260 miles west of the Outer Hebrides. The aim of the expedition to Rockall this June is to raise money for The Royal Navy and Royal Marines Charity and ABF The Soldiers' Charity with the target of making £50,000. Favourable weather conditions will be key to scaling the isolated rock, officially part of the Isle of Harris, and set up camp. The expedition is led by Chris ""Cam"" Cameron from Buckie, a professional seafarer and former member of the Gordon Highlanders. He is a marine biologist and oceanographer and has worked at sea since 1992. The expedition radio operator is Adrian ""Nobby"" Styles, a radio enthusiast since his teens. He is relishing the prospect of broadcasting from what is regarded as the world's rarest and most difficult places from which to broadcast.   The third team member is Bulgarian radio expert and mountaineer Emil Bergmann. He has scaled many major peaks in Central Asia as well as El Capitan and Half Dome in Yosemite National Park in the USA. The aim is to leave Inverkip around May 26, for the 36-hour voyage to the rocky outcrop. And during their time on Rockall, they will broadcast 24x7 by ham radio as they raise funds for The Royal Navy & Royal Marines Charity and ABF The Soldiers' Charity (formerly the Army Benevolent Fund). They had planned the adventure last year but postponed it due to the worldwide economic crisis - which had hit fundraising prospects - until 2023. In 2014 adventurer Nick Hancock lived on Britain's loneliest outpost for 45 days, with his plan having been to spend 60 days alone on Rockall, an extinct volcano.  He did manage to pass the 40 day solo occupation record set in 1985 by the SAS veteran Tom McClean and he also beat the 42 day record set by three Greenpeace campaigners in 1997.  But a severe storm in the early hours of July 2, forced him to end his planned 60 day stay early. High waves battered the rocky outcrop for hours, sweeping two weeks worth of rations into the sea.  The then 39-year-old Edinburgh-based chartered surveyor had been living in a converted water tank powered by a small wind turbine and solar panels. He created a yellow living pod from an 8ft water tank, and made it cosy with spray-on insulation foam for his bid to spend 60 days on Rockall.  Mr Hancock raised funds for the armed forces charity Help For Heroes during his stay on Rockall which is just 100ft wide and 70ft high. In 2012, Mr Hancock had stayed for a short while on Rockall as part of a reconnaissance mission for his main mission. Rockall is constantly pounded by 3,000 miles of Atlantic swell. The world's largest recorded oceanic waves of over 95 feet were recorded there in 2000 - some 19 feet higher than Rockall itself. Being in such an isolated location, only five people have now ever slept on Rockall. Only around 110 have landed on it. The occupiable area of Rockall, named in 1955 as Hall's Ledge after the first recorded person to land there, is just 11 feet by 4 feet, and is just 13 feet below the summit.

World's tallest woman forced to lie over 6 plane seats because she can't sit up,"Rumeysa Gelgi from Turkey has extremely rare condition Weaver Syndrome and stands at more than 7ft tall meaning she can't travel in normal-sized cars and flies lying downThe world's tallest woman has opened up on life at over 7ft - explaining she needs to book out six seats to be able to fly. Rumeysa Gelgi holds the Guinness World Record for the title, measuring in at 2.15m tall, or 7ft 0.7ins. The 26-year-old has extremely rare condition Weaver Syndrome - affecting only 150 people worldwide - which causes bones to grow much faster than the average rate. As a result, Rumeysa, from Turkey, can't travel in a normal-sized car, is frequently bumping against doorframes and ceilings and wears dresses as tops. She also has to fly lying down, meaning several seats are booked out to fit a bed for her to lay across.   Until last year, Rumeysa had never flown before due to her height, with Turkish Air becoming the first airline to book out seats to allow for the stretcher for a commercial flight. “Everyone was so kind,"" she told 7News. ""I did get some looks but other passengers came over to check I was ok and I really enjoyed my flight.” ""I always wanted to go to America, to work as a web developer in Silicon Valley, but California is a 14-hour flight,"" she added. As well as the stretcher, other allowances have had to be made to accommodate Rumeysa's height, including specially-made beds, chairs and a desk.  But her condition, which she was diagnosed with at just four months old, has come with a backlog of serious health problems. Rumeysa developed scoliosis as a result of the pressure on her spine, and also has a heart defect which has meant many hospital trips and being home-schooled as a child. “It was not an easy journey,” she told the Australian broadcaster. “I didn’t have any friends because I was so different to children my age but I made it. “My parents were the biggest support and I had amazing teachers.”  Rumeysa shares her journey and struggles on Instagram, which she hopes will help create more understanding about Weaver Syndrome. “It’s so rare many doctors don’t know about it,"" she said. “I also want to show people that you shouldn’t judge others by how they look. “I believe a negative thing can be turned into a positive one.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/inside-life-worlds-tallest-woman-29152611
Ferris wheel horror leaves riders hanging from their seats UPSIDE DOWN,"People riding a ferris wheel were left hanging upside down after the ride broke down. Horrifying footage showed people dangling upside down in their seats in India's Sahibganj district yesterdayTerrifying footage has captured fairground customers dangling upside down in their seats after a Ferris wheel broke. Four people were in the carriage when the accident happened in India's Sahibganj district on Monday, February 6. Horrified onlookers filmed three of the riders lying down in the pod while the fourth was seen standing up. The cart continues to break away from the ride as it approaches the ground, swinging dangerously as people rush to help them down. One particularly distressing moment occurred as the wheel began to move again as those left stranded on the cart cling to it. The other carriages on the ride in Rajmahal appeared to be unaffected by the problem.   It is not clear whether the passengers sustained any injuries. In January, a young Thai man was knocked out when a 20-kilogramme Ferris wheel cabin door fell on top of him.  The incident occurred at the Red Cross Fair in Buriram province, northeast Thailand, when the door fell on the man from around 10 metres up.  Sutthiwat Kruephimai said he heard a loud noise coming from somewhere above his head, before a door suddenly crashed down on him.  The event in the Lam Prai Mart, Thaiger reported, was marred when a rescue team had to give first aid to the Sutthiwat, 21. He was treated in hospital and has since been discharged.  Luckily, Sutthiwat did not sustain any life-threatening injuries but walked away with bruises all over his head and body.  Sutthiwat attended the fair with his grandparents and a young relative aged seven. He was waiting by the wheel while a young relative went on the ride with Sutthiwat's grandmother.  No other members of the family were injured. Natthapon Kloy-on, 38, is the owner of the Ferris wheel and said he compensate Sutthiwat with 2,000 Thai baht, equivalent to just over £49.

"Boy, 14, died during police chase driving car that had been 'stolen in armed robbery'","Leo Gradwell 'lost control' of the Fiat 500 in Golborne, Greater Manchester before colliding with a Kia Sportage and then a Renault Clio, on October 11, 2019 A 14-year-old boy died after crashing a stolen car as he was chased by police, an inquest jury has been told.  Leo Gradwell 'lost control' of the Fiat 500 in Golborne, Greater Manchester before colliding with a Kia Sportage and then a Renault Clio, on October 11, 2019.   The teen was being chased by police at the time of the crash after the car matched the description of a vehicle that had been stolen the previous night in Wigan.  The coroner's court heard that a blue Fiat 500 had been taken by two masked males, one of whom had allegedly been carrying an axe.  Leo was not alleged to be one of the assailants. A two-week inquest into the boy's death is being heard at Bolton Town Hall in front of a jury and senior coroner Timothy Brennand. The hearing was told that officers received a number of sightings throughout the morning and early afternoon on October 11 before they began following the car at about 1.25pm.  CCTV footage played in court showed a portion of the chase from a number of different cameras, including the moment the Fiat flipped onto its side. Following the collision, Leo went into cardiac arrest at the scene and was initially rushed to Royal Albert Edward Infirmary, before being taken to Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital - where he was later pronounced dead. Home Office Pathologist Dr Philip Lumb carried out a post-mortem on Leo’s body and recorded a ‘head injury’ as the cause of his death, the Manchester Evening News reports. Dr Lumb said he was unable to conclude whether or not Leo was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the incident. Leo’s family was legally represented by barrister Mass Ndow-Njie and through him, they expressed ‘concerns’ about the manner in which Leo was ‘extracted’ from the car.  Dr Lumb responded that he was not an ‘expert on extractions’ but said that in his view, the injuries were unsurvivable. “He had a very serious head injury and I don’t think he would have survived, whatever had happened,” Dr Lumb told the inquest.  Leo's mum Kirsty Gradwell cried as Mr Brennand read out her statement, where she described Leo as a 'caring', 'playful', and 'loving' child, who had never been arrested. However, Ms Gradwell admitted that as Leo got older, 'something changed' and his behaviour got worse, which led him to being excluded from Byrchall High School and moving to Special Educational Needs school Newbridge Learning Community. Ms Gradwell also said that Leo loved motorbikes and that he wanted to be a professional rider when he grew up. Speaking about the moment that Leo's life support was switched off in hospital, Ms Gradwell added: ""To watch Leo die before my eye was the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with... I put my hand on his chest and felt his heart stop beating. I felt devastated.""   Mr Brennand also read a statement that Ms Gradwell gave to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).  In the statement, she described the scene of the crash, and accused an officer of speaking to her with a 'cold' tone of voice.  The inquest has been adjourned until Wednesday and is expected to hear representations from the emergency services and both hospitals in the coming days.",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/boy-14-died-during-police-29152138
Paranormal and alien believers are 'less likely to get a good night's sleep',"Sleep researchers at London's Goldsmith's University had noticed a spooky correlation between people's beliefs in ghosts and the supernatural, and the quality of their sleepBelievers in the paranormal are far more like to have insomnia as they're kept awake by bumps in the night, a sleep study has revealed.  That's right – if you believe in ghosts, demons and even aliens – chances are you'll have a harder time nodding off. Sleep scientists at Goldsmith's University in London surveyed thousands of people on whether they believed in ghosts, the afterlife and extra-terrestrials, while also measuring their quality of sleep. The study, published in the Journal of Sleep Research, claimed an interest or belief in the supernatural could lead to heightened anxiety at night, and in turn keep you awake. Psychologists have already defined a link showing that believers are more likely to experience sleep paralysis – a phenomenon where people wake in the night unable to move, and often report seeing figures in the corner of the room.   Psychology PhD researcher Betul Rauf said: ""For some, these events are frightening and can cause anxiety and fear, which can in turn disrupt sleep. ""Our research team thought it would be helpful to understand more about the association between sleep and ostensibly paranormal beliefs as this could potentially help people better understand some of these experiences."" Some 8,853 people completed the survey, which posed questions asking them to rate how strongly they believed in things such as life after death, whether aliens have visited Earth, and whether humans can talk to the dead. Nearly a third (31.7%) said they ""definitely didn't"" believe in ghosts, which a higher percentage still (41.2%) denied that people can communicate with them. Only 8% meanwhile said they outright believed in spirits and spectres. Those believing in the paranormal however were far more likely to report struggles falling asleep. The belief in aliens was ""significantly associated"" with the sleep disorder 'exploding head syndrome' - a condition causing loud noises in a person's head when both falling asleep and waking up - the scientists also found. Ms Rauf told the psychology research journal PsyPost however that the findings don't necessarily prove a causal link between the two. “We are simply reporting on the associations that we have found,"" she said. ""There are many reasons why there could be association between sleep variables and paranormal beliefs and these need to be investigated fully in future work. ""What is clear is that there is great public interest in this topic – and people want to know more.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/paranormal-alien-believers-less-likely-29153459
Russian oil refinery erupts in latest mystery fire at key energy installations,"Ten fire brigades were sent to tackle the blaze, and there was a call for reinforcements amid a ""difficult situation"" at a giant Lukoil installation near Nizhny Novgorod, some 300 miles east of Moscow in RussiaA huge oil refinery has gone up in flames in Russia with footage from the scene this morning showing black plumes of smoke billowing from the facility. The inferno at a giant Lukoil installation near Nizhny Novgorod, some 300 miles east of Moscow, is the latest mystery fire to hit key energy installations amid the war against Ukraine. Footage showed large flames from a damaged gasoline pipe at the complex in Kstovsky district. Ten fire brigades were sent to tackle the blaze, and there was a call for reinforcements amid a ""difficult situation"", according to local reports. There were no initial reports of casualties. Russia has been hit by a succession of fires at strategic sites amid suspicions that some are sabotage in protest at Vladimir Putin.  The Lukoil Nizhegorodnefteorgsintez facility is one of Russia’s largest oil refineries, with a capacity of 17 million tonnes per year.   It produces automotive, aviation and diesel fuels, as well as petroleum bitumen and paraffins. Blazes have been seen at strategic oil and gas facilities including storage depots, military facilities and shopping malls, sometimes following explosions in many Russian regions, including Moscow. A fire broke out on board Russia’s only aircraft carrier, Admiral Kuznetsov, on December 22 in Arctic port Murmansk while the vessel was under repairs from an earlier major inferno. A fire with dense smoke also hit Russia's foreign ministry in Moscow. Last month multiple explosions and a huge inferno ignited a fuel storage depot and railway carriages in Angarsk, Irkutsk region. Thick black smoke from the disaster was seen 27 miles away in Irkutsk.  The explosions - reported by locals in Angarsk - and inferno in biting minus 30C cold was the third major incident in the region in five weeks. On December 19, Armageddon-like flames shot into the sky from the giant blaze at the Markovskoye condensate treatment unit at Ust-Kut. Three days earlier a massive fire at Angarsk Oil Refinery was triggered by a blast compared to an earthquake or plane crash. Military enlistment offices have also been repeatedly attacked. Last week a top secret Russian military intelligence training centre was hit by a major fire. The inferno was at Senezh in Moscow region, at a GRU spy agency facility.

Al Sharpton warns failure to address UK police brutality will lead to more deaths,"Civil rights veteran Reverend Al Sharpton is currently visiting the UK and has warned that police brutality incidents such as the recent killing of Tyre Nichols by Memphis officers could happen in the UK without reformsCivil rights veteran Reverend Al Sharpton has warned that police brutality incidents such as the recent killing of Tyre Nichols by Memphis officers could happen in the UK without policing reforms. Father-of-one Tyre, was Tasered and brutality beaten to death following a traffic stop on January 7, 2023 and six officers have now been fired with five being charged with his murder. Now Reverend Al Sharpton who attended the 29-year-old's funeral alongside US Vice-President Kamala Harris says that “systemic racism” and a “culture of policing that produces brutality” needed to be addressed. He stated that without doing so, tragedies like that of Tyre who died in hospital three days later could happen in Britain. Reverend Al Sharpton said: “The failure to address systemic racism in UK policing and the culture of policing that produces brutality against our people will only lead to more incidences like the tragedy of Tyre Nichols”   During his current visit to the UK, the reverend appeared on ITV's Good Morning Britain today (February 7) alongside political activist Lord Simon Wooley and founder of Operation Black Vote, echoing the same sentiment. Speaking to host Susanna Reid who asked whether Britain had less problems with police brutality, he stated that the UK 'has a problem.' He said: ""I think also the comparisons, clearly you don't have the same scale but you have a problem. ""If you and I were in the hospital, does it make you feel better to say, 'well Sharpton is sicker than you are', well both of us are sick and we need to heal.""  He went on to add that there needed to be laws to ensure that police could not brutalise people of colour without consequence. He said: ""The fear people have here of being treated differently is unimaginable for people in the United States who are white to think they would put a knee on their neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds but it happened. ""It was not out of our imagination [as black people].""  A damning UN report last month found that the UK government has failed to address “structural, institutional and systemic racism” against people of African descent in Britain. In a statement the UN working group said: “We have serious concerns about impunity and the failure to address racial disparities in the criminal justice system, deaths in police custody, ‘joint enterprise’ convictions and the dehumanising nature of the stop and (strip) search.” Numerous black men died at the hands of the police last year with one case sparking protests across the UK. Chris Kaba, 24, was shot dead while sat in a car by armed police officers in Streatham but no gun was found in the vehicle or near the scene. The IOPC is conducting a criminal investigation into the officer who discharged their firearm which led to Kaba’s death set to conclude before the end of the year.   While Oladeji Omishore who was believed to be suffering a mental health crisis, died after being after being shot with a Taser weapon on Chelsea Bridge before plunging into the river Thames. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) are investigating Oladeji's death however, his heartbroken family blasted the investigation calling it “flawed” as the officers involved had not been interviewed under caution almost five months later they are still on active duty. On October 7, 2022, a mixed-race (white and black Caribbean) man in ""distress"" died shortly after being restrained by police officers in Hertfordshire. He had called the police himself for help before he was sprayed with PAVA, a pepper-spray like substance before he struggled to breathe and subsequently died. An investigation is underway to establish the circumstances surrounding this incident and examine the officers conduct before with the man before he died. There have been other deaths following police contact last year and over the years in the UK which prompted campaigns against police brutality.  For the last 24 years, the United Families & Friends Campaign (UFFC) run by justice campaigner Marcia Rigg - meet annually to remember those they have lost to deaths in police custody as well as psychiatric institutions and prisons. Justice campaigner Marcia Rigg has been leading the marches since her brother Sean Rigg died in police custody while suffering a mental health episode.  She took over the UFFC from Brenda Weinberg, the sister of Brian Douglas, who died after being hit with a long-handled baton by police officers in Clapham.  Speaking to the Mirror she said: “We're seeing that other people are dying or being restrained. “The march is always on the last Saturday of October every year. [Brenda] had been campaigning. In the tenth year [of the marches] she was tired. “She just said, ‘I’m going to give you the baton to keep it going. I’ve been heading it for the last 14 years.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/al-sharpton-warns-failure-address-29152765
Tory MP who said Brits using foodbanks can't cook or budget made deputy chairman,"The appointment comes just two weeks after Lee Anderson compared Rishi Sunak's Government to the 'band on the Titanic' over its asylum seeker policy, according to a string of leaked WhatsApp messagesA divisive Tory who claimed hard-up foodbank users can't cook or budget has been named as the party's deputy chairman. Ashfield MP Lee Anderson was handed the post as part of Rishi Sunak's Cabinet reshuffle following the sacking of Tory chairman Nadhim Zahawi over his tax affairs. The right-wing Brexiteer will serve under new chairman Greg Hands, a London MP who backed Remain, in a sign Mr Sunak is trying to appease hardliners in his party. The official Tory Twitter account posted: ""Welcome Lee Anderson - our new Deputy Chairman of the Conservatives."" Mr Anderson, a former coal miner, tweeted: ""Yes it's true. From the Pits to Parliament. Feeling very proud."" It comes just two weeks after Mr Anderson compared the Government to the ""band on the Titanic"" over its asylum seeker policy, according to a string of leaked WhatsApp messages. Mr Anderson has repeatedly ranted about struggling Brits relying on foodbanks - and earned the nickname '30p Lee' for his claims about the cost of meals.   He sparked fury last month by claiming foodbank users squander their cash on cigarettes, alcohol, expensive TV subscriptions and holidays. He then used one of his aides to make the argument that nurses shouldn't be using foodbanks - by claiming his employee earned £30,000 a year and did not need to use a foodbank. The woman was subjected to a wave of online abuse. Mr Anderson also rubbished reports that nurses are being forced to rely on foodbanks. “Anybody earning 30 odd grand a year, which most nurses are, using food banks, then they’ve got something wrong with their own finances,"" he told TimesRadio last month. It comes after he stunned MPs with a furious tirade in the Commons last year about how poverty-hit Brits can't cook properly or budget. He claimed there was ""not this massive use for food banks in this country"", despite the cost of living pressures clobbering families. He said people could ""cook meals from scratch"" for 30p a day instead of relying on foodbanks. Mr Anderson went on: ""I think you will see there is not this massive use for food banks in this country.  ""We have got generation after generation who cannot cook properly. They cannot cook a meal from scratch. They cannot budget.""  Last year, he decided to boycott the Euros in protest at the England team's decision to ""take the knee"" in support of anti-racist campaigners. The sulking MP said: “For the first time in my life I will not be watching my beloved England team whilst they are supporting a political movement whose core principles aim to undermine our very way of life.” He later said he'd check the score on his phone during the final of the tournament. And Mr Anderson even got into hot water before he was even elected in 2019 when he was caught getting his mate to pose as an anti-Labour voter during a TV interview. He appeared to forget he was wearing a microphone when he phoned a pal to set up the door knock while on the campaign trail with veteran reporter Michael Crick. “Make out you know who I am... you know I’m the candidate, but not a friend, alright,"" he was heard saying. During the campaign for the 2019 election, Mr Anderson said ""nuisance tenants"" should be made to live in tents in a field and pick vegetables. Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner, retweeting the ""Titanic"" remarks, posted on the social media: ""Update: he's been handed a deck chair."" Zarah Sultana, Labour MP for Coventry South, tweeted: ""Lee Anderson MP has just been made deputy chair of the Conservative Party. ""He boycotted the England team because they took the knee and said people in poverty 'cannot budget' and should cook 30p meals. ""That sound you can hear? It's the Conservatives scraping the barrel."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tory-mp-who-said-brits-29156231
Happy Valley's James Norton warns 'don't follow Rishi Sunak's advice' over education plan,"Happy Valley star James Norton has criticised Rishi Sunak's plan to extend maths education to 18 year olds over fears it will stop pupils from exploring their love of the arts James Norton, who starred as notorious villain Tommy Lee Royce in BBC's Happy Valley has hit out at Prime Minister Rishi Sunak over his plans to push all pupils in England to study maths until 18.  The actor shared his frustration with The News Agents podcast hosts Emily Maitlis and Lewis Goodall. James was asked about the ways the arts can be opened up for children across the country. He replied: ""Well, first thing you do is you don't follow Rishi Sunak’s advice and make everyone take maths through to A Level and you nurture arts and humanities all the way through school and allow kids to take on courses which aren't necessarily as practical and vocational.   ""And so, you that's the most important thing is school,"" he continued. ""I guess, making sure that they are supported and there's outreach programmes from centres of excellence in London and then in other big cities, and they get out to those schools, and they introduce kids to theatre at an early age and so there's an awareness. ""And then it's youth theatres and I mean, I was so lucky I grew up in North Yorkshire and every summer holidays, I did a youth theatre, it was called Livewire and it was great. ""I went to Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough for work experience one summer and so there was stuff there.""  James praised the UK's cultural heritage and spoke of the importance of ""nurturing the arts"". ""This country's got such a cultural heritage and to waste that... Talk about us standing on the world stage right now,"" he said. ""I mean, the way shows like Happy Valley travel over to America, it's amazing. I feel so proud when I go over there, and random people come up to me on the street and talk to me about Hebden Bridge… They watch it with subtitles on, but they love it.""  ""And it's an amazing advert for this country. So, I think we need to keep nurturing the arts,"" he added. Happy Valley came to a dramatic conclusion on Sunday as the cat-and-mouse chase between Tommy and Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire) finally came to an end.  After a tense confrontation between the two characters, Tommy set himself on fire while Catherine walked away into retirement.

Three in five Brits fear crisis-hit social care system will not meet their needs,"The alert comes in a poll for the Liberal Democrats amid growing warnings about the impact the social care crisis is having on the under-pressure NHS as it battles strikes and backlogsThe social care crisis is so deep an overwhelming majority of Britons fear the system will be unable to meet their needs, a poll shows tonight. Some 62% of adults quizzed admitted that if they required future social care they were not confident high-quality care could be provided. Just 32% believed they would receive the care they needed, according to the online Savanta study of 2,320 UK adults for the Liberal Demorats. The warning comes as the Mirror continues to campaign for Fair Care For All, including boosting carers’ pay to the Real Living Wage. Experts say it would help ease pressure on the NHS, freeing up hospital beds because patients well enough to be discharged can leave. Read More
  Party leader Sir Ed Davey said: “I applaud the work the Mirror does to campaign for better social care in our country and particularly their campaign for care workers to be paid fairly. “This social care crisis is also having a devastating impact on the NHS, contributing to record long waits at A&E and terrible ambulance delays. “Thousands of people are stranded in hospital beds because there simply aren’t enough care workers to look after them at home or in a care home.” Earlier this week, Sir Ed said carers should be paid £12.42 an hour to ease the chronic crisis gripping the sector and release pressure on the health service.  Experts say boosting rates would help tackle desperate staff shortages. Former coalition Cabinet Minister Sir Ed wants social care workers to be paid £11.50 an hour now - and £12.42 from April. Tens of thousands of carers are paid just the legal minimum: £9.50 an hour for employees aged 23 and over, £9.18 for staff aged 21 and 22 and just £6.83 for employees aged 18 to 20. In contrast, the Real Living Wage, set by the Living Wage Foundation, is £10.90 an hour, rising to £11.95 in London, and it does not differ by age. The Mirror is campaigning for Fair Care For All, including paying care workers the Real Living Wage. Lib Dem plans go even further. Sir Ed said: “The first step to fixing this mess is to pay those working in social care more, to prevent the exodus of workers to supermarkets and other better-paid jobs. “I have seen first-hand the incredible job that care workers do day in and day out. “This is a skilled and crucial job and it should be paid more.” * Follow Mirror Politics on Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter and Facebook ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/three-five-brits-fear-crisis-29155132
'Rishi Sunak is too weak to make fat cat oil firms pay their share',"In an article for the Mirror, Shadow Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said it is 'outrageous ' oil and gas giants are raking in enormous sums as BP reported its profits doubled to £23billion last yearLabour has spent the last year campaigning for a windfall tax on the oil and gas companies for one simple reason - that when companies are raking in the windfalls of war to make record profits at the expense of households across the country, it is only right that they pay their fair share in tax. In the last week we have seen Shell and BP clock up record profits - money coming directly out of people's pockets in the form of their energy bills. What is so outrageous is that as fossil fuel companies rake in these enormous sums, Rishi Sunak is too weak to make them pay their fair share. His pale imitation of Labour's proposed windfall tax has more holes than a Swiss cheese. It hands huge tax giveaways to fossil fuel companies, only starts from May 2022, and is at a rate lower than other countries.  A proper windfall tax could raise billions of additional revenue which could go straight back to help families with their soaring bills this winter. Read More
  It is staggering the Conservatives want to leave this money on the table because in just eight weeks’ time, the Government plans to allow the energy price cap to rise to £3,000.  Labour would use a proper windfall tax to stop prices going up in April. This is why people are sick and tired of the way the country is run under the Tories.  How can it be right that the British people struggle to pay their energy bills whilst the fossil fuel companies make record profits?  It is a basic question of fairness and the Conservatives, as usual, are failing to stand up to the powerful vested interests on behalf of the British people. Ultimately, Britain needs to get off expensive fossil fuels and onto clean, homegrown power.  Labour has a plan to make Britain a clean energy superpower by 2030- cutting bills, boosting our energy independence, and creating good jobs across our country.  But as well as a long term plan, we need basic fairness on the cost of living. That is what Rishi Sunak will never deliver. * Follow Mirror Politics on Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter and Facebook.

Campaigners warning over US tech giant's NHS links as deadline for deal looms,"Palantir is in the running for a major contract with the health service, with the initial deadline for applying for the bumper bonanza later this weekCampaigners fear a multi-billion dollar US tech firm is in pole position to scoop the biggest private contract in NHS history. Colorado-based Palantir Technologies is thought to be in the running for the health service’s £360million “Federated Data Platform”, which will boost the use of data analysis. The NHS has described the system as a future “operating system for the health service”. Palantir is already contracted to the NHS, having been among big tech firms to team up with the health service to ensure vital medical equipment was available to the facilities most in need during the coronavirus outbreak. Just one month has been allocated for firms to initially bid for the deal, which insiders say is unusual for such a high-value contract. The procurement was launched on January 10 and the competition closes on Thursday, according to the Government’s online tender.   The Mirror has been told the short-time span could offer a boost to a bid by Palantir because it would benefit from its existing links. Industry sources stressed the overall procurement period was longer than just one month. But Dr Martin Blanchard, of Keep Our NHS Public said: “This procurement is a farce and the contract winner, Palantir, already has its feet under the table in NHS England. “There is no time for a true competition given the deadline for alternative providers and the complexity of the matter.” He added: “It is sad to see how far we have come in this Government’s drive to commercialise the NHS.”  The five-year contract is due to start in September, with an option for two 12-month extensions worth another £120m. The advert says: “The data platform will be owned and controlled by the NHS to unlock the power of NHS data to understand patterns, solve problems, plan services for local populations and ultimately transform the health and care of the people they serve.” Palantir’s website says it builds “software that empowers organisations to effectively integrate their data, decisions, and operation”. It boasts of a current deal with the health service, saying: “The NHS uses Palantir Foundry to make better use of data to improve patients' lives. “Foundry is world-class software that's having outsized impact across the healthcare sector. “Foundry helps front-line clinicians and support staff focus on delivering better patient care by placing the right information at their fingertips. “It connects the back-office software systems and analytics teams directly with care givers. “With security and information governance as a first-order priority, Foundry helps healthcare providers make the best decisions, at speed.” In a tweet last week, the firm boasted that Rishi Sunak had praised the firm.  It posted: “According to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Palantir Foundry is doing ‘a really good job’ in reducing the elective care backlog.  “We’re proud our software is helping NHS England staff to reduce waiting lists and improve patient outcomes.”The post quoted the PM saying: “Foundry is one (system) that does a really good job. “At Chelsea and Wesmtinster (this technology) led to almost one third reduction in their backlog.” But other Tory MPs have previously spoken out about Palantir - which has a host of other contracts in other sectors across the globe - being used by the NHS. Speaking in June 2021, ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis, who has campaigned to protect civil liberties and against privacy invasions, told the Commons: “Patient trust is vital to our NHS, so foreign tech companies such as Palantir, with their history of supporting mass surveillance, assisting in drone strikes, immigration raids and predictive policing, must not be placed at the heart of our NHS.”  Trades Union Congress assistant general secretary Kate Bell said today: ""The public deserve to know how their health data is being used and who it is being shared with. ""The prospect of big corporations being handed the keys to millions of patients' records is really worrying. ""We need full transparency and openness from the Government on why companies like Palantir are being given access to our NHS. ""People's private health data is not something that should be monetised or traded - it should be handled ethically and for our direct benefit only. ""The public needs to have confidence this Government can do that, but the Conservatives' track record of handing out contracts without proper scrutiny is appalling."" Lib Dem health spokesman Lord Richard Allan said: ""Previous Governments have wasted millions on NHS IT projects that failed to deliver and this Government has wasted billions buying dodgy PPE. ""We need the highest levels of scrutiny to make sure this project does not go the same way.  ""It is essential to avoid contracts that lock the NHS into using a particular vendor. “If a supplier does not perform we have to be able to kick them out and switch to a better option."" Joanna Peller, who co-leads Palantir’s NHS work, said the company was “proud to have supported the NHS during Covid, when our software was used for the vaccine rollout and to distribute PPE and ventilators”. She added: “We’re equally proud we are currently helping to reduce the care backlog, cut the amount of time nurses and doctors need to spend on administrative tasks, and speed up cancer diagnosis - all while rigorously protecting data privacy. “Most importantly, we are seeing promising results - for instance at Chelsea and Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, which has seen a 28% waiting list reduction and suspected cancer patients being seen two days faster.” An NHS spokesman said: “NHS England is conducting a fair and transparent procurement for the Federated Data Platform and Associated Services contract in line with public contracts regulations. “The 30-day period advertised in the contract notice only relates to the time-period suppliers can register their interest in the opportunity and complete the standard selection questionnaire. “The procurement is anticipated to complete in late summer 2023.” * Follow Mirror Politics on Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter and Facebook ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/campaigners-warning-over-tech-giants-29154470
Price of train tickets to fluctuate based on demand under new trial scheme,"The new scheme will work under a demand and supply system, which will see train fares fluctuate depending on how many seats have been filled on London North Eastern Railway servicesThe price of train tickets will rise and fall based on demand under a trial to be announced later today by Transport Secretary Mark Harper. Travellers on some London North Eastern Railway (LNER) services will test out the new way of pricing. The new scheme will work under a demand and supply system, which will see train fares fluctuate depending on how many seats have been filled. LNER runs between London King's Cross and Scotland via the East Coast Main Line. Mr Harper will also confirm plans to expand single leg pricing across the entire LNER network - effectively scrapping return tickets.  Single fare will always be half the cost of a return under this scheme, the Department for Transport has said. For example, an off-peak single between Durham and London currently costs £1 less than a return. Many one-way fares will be almost halved as a result of the reform, according to the DfT. LNER, a publicly owned operator, has trialled single-leg pricing on some of its routes since 2020. The DfT said it will consider rolling out the system across all of Britain's rail network depending on the success of the extended pilot scheme. It comes as train fares in England will increase by up to 5.9% from March 5.  Delivering the annual George Bradshaw address to rail industry leaders in central London on Tuesday night, Mr Harper is expected to say: ""Today I am setting out the Government's long-term vision for the future of our railways. ""The industry's road to recovery after Covid has been tough, with reform badly needed to win back that lost passenger revenue while putting customers first. ""Today's announcement is the latest example of this Government taking bold decisions and getting on with the job. ""Growing the economy is rightly one of the Prime Minister's top five priorities, and the measures I announce today will unleash more competition, innovation and growth in an important sector of our economy."" Labour's shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said: ""Whichever ticket you buy, passengers are paying more for less under the Conservatives' broken rail system. ""Thirteen years of failure has seen fares soar, more services than ever cancelled, while failing operators continue to be handed millions in taxpayers' cash. ""The next Labour Government will put passengers back at the heart of our railways, and build the infrastructure fit for the century ahead, unlocking jobs and growth.""

Warning as one in five £66 energy vouchers expired without being used,"The vouchers are being sent out as part of a £400 package of help over winter, split up over six months, to combat sky-high energy bills - but worrying number are going unclaimed One in five people didn’t cash in their £66 energy discount voucher in November, worrying new figures show.   The vouchers are being sent out as part of a £400 package of help over winter, split up over six months, to combat sky-high bills.  Those who pay by direct debit, on receipt of bill, or have a smart meter, should be receiving the money automatically. But those with a traditional prepayment meter are sent vouchers, which they need to redeem the through PayPoint or a Post Office. The vouchers typically only last 90 days after they were issued - and new data from PayPoint shows a concerning number of people missed this deadline. Only 81% of those vouchers had been redeemed on Sunday when they ran out.  PayPoint said 79% of customers have so far redeemed their December vouchers. The rest have until March 8 to do so. Meanwhile, the 28% of customers who have not yet redeemed their January vouchers have until April 9. The vouchers are sent by post or through email or text message. Your energy supplier won't need to ask for your bank details to apply the discount - so be aware of scammers trying to contact you. Steve O'Neill, corporate affairs and marketing director at PayPoint, said: ""Last November's EBSS (energy bill support scheme) vouchers have now expired and overall redemptions are consistent with October vouchers at 81%. ""Our 28,000 retailer partners across the UK have once again done a fantastic job in supporting their local communities and delivering this vital support. ""Final redemptions of over four in five recipients is generally considered a good result for Government voucher schemes, based on others like the warm home discount.""  He added: ""A PayPoint survey of 2,000 adults using its services over the first three weeks of January showed 93% found it easy to redeem their EBSS vouchers at a top-up point. ""It also found 91% of people wait two weeks or less to redeem EBSS vouchers after receiving them, while 81% wait one week or less. ""Almost a quarter, 23%, said they wait less than a day."" Direct debit customers should be receiving their energy bill discount automatically - meaning you don't need to do anything to get the money off. The cash will be applied either as a deduction to your monthly direct debit, or as a refund to your bank account after your direct debit has been taken. If you don't pay by direct debit, the discount will be applied as a credit to your energy account each month. The credit should appear as if you'd made a payment to your energy bill. Smart prepayment meter customers will also receive the discount automatically each month. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/warning-one-five-66-energy-29152317
'Digital pound' could be launched by the Bank of England - what we know so far,"The Bank of England said the ""digital pound"" would not be ""volatile"" like cryptocurrencies because it would come from a legislated organisation rather than a private sectorA new ""digital pound"" could be launched in the UK within the next ten years with plans currently being considered by the Bank of England (BoE) and the HM Treasury. If introduced, the central bank digital currency (CBDC) would be issued by the Bank and households and businesses could use it for everyday payments in stores and online. The currency would also be interchangeable with cash and bank deposits alongside normal money, which the Treasury says will ""complement cash"".  But unlike cryptocurrencies, the ""digital pound"" would not be ""volatile"" because it would come from a legislated organisation rather than a private sector Both the Treasury and the central bank have said a digital pound may help when prioritising the public's access to safe money.  They also agree it could support ""private sector innovation, choice and efficiency in digital payments"".  In its announcement of the consultation yesterday, the Bank of England and the Treasury confirmed that no decision has been taken at this stage however, both departments will continue to research and develop the concept.  Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt said: ""While cash is here to stay, a digital pound issued and backed by the Bank of England could be a new way to pay that’s trusted, accessible and easy to use. ""That’s why we want to investigate what is possible first, whilst always making sure we protect financial stability.” A decision about whether to implement a digital pound will be taken around the middle of the decade and will be based on ""future developments in money and payments"" the Bank of England said.  The earliest stage at which the digital pound could be launched would be the second half of the 2020s.   A digital pound will always have the same value as cash however it would just be replicated in digital format and accessed through digital wallets on smartphones or smartcards. The Bank of England claims the payment method would be ""widely available"" and would be ""risk-free, convenient and trusted"" as it would be subject to ""rigorous standards of privacy and data protection"".  It said: ""Neither the Government nor the Bank would have access to personal data and holders would have the same level of privacy as a bank account.""  There may be initial restrictions on how much you can spend or hold at once, but that is still to be discussed. Central bank digital currencies are reportedly under development in more than 100 countries globally in China, the US and in countries in the Eurozone.

Tesco shoppers slam 'awful' checkouts and complain they 'might as well use Lidl now',"Last year Tesco announced it was to remove some of its traditional checkouts from many of its larger stores to move to more self-service tills and this was decision was met with divided opinionTesco customers are blasting the supermarket chain over a rise in the number of self-service checkouts that have appeared in stores. One disgruntled shopper took to Facebook to claim staff told them the supermarket was now ""prioritising"" self-service tills instead of conventional checkouts. The shopper, who visited the Whiteley branch in Hampshire, wrote: ""If you don't mind waiting in huge queues or using self-serve for a full trolley of food this is the store for you... might as well use Lidl now."" Other shoppers agreed with the complaint and shared they had also visited the same Tesco branch in Whitely and had experienced ""packed tills"".  Another commented: ""It was the same on Saturday, absolutely packed at the tills and when customers commented on it staff said, it's a normal Saturday.  ""It was not normal, I'd never seen Tescos like that before. I won't be using the store if it continues. Awful policy."" The complaints, however, are not just limited to the Whitely branch. Tesco shoppers across the country are venting their frustrations online about the limited number of till staff working at their local stores. One shopper shared on Facebook: ""Just been into Tescos, the first time since Christmas and they've replaced most of the serviced tills with self-service. I would say at least 3/4 of them are now self-service. ""This is in a Tesco Extra Store, I refuse to use them, and I can see a few arguments ensuing in the future. They seem to have put most of the staff overseeing the self-service tills for now!  ""I expect more redundancies will follow putting many people out of work.  ""It's disgusting! IF YOU WANT TO PROTEST USE THE SERVICED TILLS, EVEN IF IT MEANS STANDING IN A VERY LONG QUEUE! Remember we are all getting older and life becomes more difficult as it is!""   Another shared their experience at the Tesco Newry branch and said the number of manned tills had ""been greatly reduced"" and the self-service area extended.  They wrote: ""Only a few tills open forcing customers with trolleys to queue in the aisles. I asked one of them to open another till but he refused.  ""They were herding everyone to use self-service instead. Defiantly will not be back to shop there again. Disgrace... on a busy Friday afternoon..."" Further criticisms have also been made on the decision to make their self-service checkouts cashless which many have said penalises those wanting/needing to pay with cash.  Twitter user @mb20nut said: ""Hey @Tesco if your Extra branch in Streatham is going to discriminate against those wanting to pay with cash at self-service, and your lottery till won't allow more than 3 shop items to be purchased there - PUT MORE PEOPLE ON THE TILLS. Queues are a joke.""  Last year Tesco announced it was to remove some of its traditional checkouts from many of its larger stores to move to more self-service tills. The supermarket said the decision to do this was due to the “lack of customer demand”. Tesco said the newly introduced self-service checkouts would be three times longer than standard sizes, allowing up to six bags to be packed at once, making them more suitable for customers buying more goods for a weekly shop.  This news was met with divided opinion, with some loving and some hating the announcement, but does follow the trend of other supermarkets such as Co-Op and Sainsbury's choosing to turn to automation services.  A petition was launched last year by disability campaigner Pat McCarthy on Change.org which called on Tesco, which was her local supermarket, to stop introducing self-service, card-only tills in its stores as it was discriminatory to disabled individuals.  As of February 2023, this petition has received nearly a quarter of a million signatures.  Tesco told Mirror Money that all of its stores, bar its Holborn branch in central London, offer a choice between staff-operated and self-service checkouts A Tesco spokesperson said: “Our colleagues and the friendly service they provide are absolutely vital to our stores and will always be on hand to help our customers, whether they are checking out at one of our colleague-operated or self-service checkouts.  ""We first introduced self-service checkouts nearly 20 years ago to give our customers a choice and our stores have both types of checkout. “We also remain committed to providing a wide choice of payment options at our stores, so that customers can pay using the method that best suits them, whether that is cash, card or contactless.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/tesco-shoppers-slam-awful-checkouts-29153011
OAPs demand general election amid warnings of 'two years of decline and drift',"The SurveyMonkey poll for the Silver Voices group revealed an overwhelming majority in favour of a ballot in 2023 amid growing anger at the ConservativesPensioners have piled pressure on the Tories to trigger a general election. Nearly nine out 10 over-60s polled by campaign group Silver Voices threw their weight behind calls for a ballot this year which could oust the Conservatives after 13 years in power. Some 893 out of 1,016 members - an overwhelming 88% - who took part in the SurveyMonkey study last month were in favour of an election. They backed a ballot “so that all political parties can lay out their detailed solutions to the multiple challenges facing the country, and voters can make their choice on the composition of a new UK Government with a fresh policy mandate”. Just 123 - 12% - were opposed. The next election does not have to be held until January 2025 - and voters are not expected to go to the polls until mid-2024 at the earliest. Read More
  Silver Voices director Dennis Reed said: “The Conservative Government seems intent on hanging on to the last possible moment, which could be as late as 2025, but it appears to have run out of ideas for tackling the cost-of-living crisis, the collapse of the NHS and other public services, and rising pensioner poverty. “The Prime Minister has a weak political mandate and no discernible vision for the future of the country.” The group has launched an online petition calling for a ballot. The change.org demand says: “With collapsing public services, a cost-of-living crisis, rising poverty, a stagnant economy and continuing scandals, this Government is incapable of meeting the challenges facing post-Brexit, post-pandemic UK. “Long-term damage is being inflicted on the British public, including millions of older people represented by Silver Voices, with countless avoidable deaths caused by the health and social care crisis and fuel poverty. “The country cannot afford another two years of decline and drift and a general election must be held in 2023 for a fresh start.  “It is high time for all political parties to lay out their solutions to the challenges and for voters to decide on a new government with a fresh policy mandate.” Mr Reed told the Mirror: “The UK cannot afford two more years of drift, and we must recognise that no matter how hard we campaign, this Government is very unlikely to make substantial changes on pensions, social care, the NHS, cost-of living support and all the other issues which our members care so deeply about, before the next election.” Nearly 150,000 people have signed a Mirror/38 Degrees petition demanding a general election now. We told last week how a Redfield and Wilton online poll of 1,500 adults for this newspaper found 52% of voters believe Parliament should call a general election now, with only 32% opposed. Four in 10 think Mr Sunak - who became PM after he was backed by Conservative MPs having lost the Tory summer leadership race to Liz Truss - does not have a mandate to govern. * Follow Mirror Politics on Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter and Facebook ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/oaps-demand-general-election-amid-29154796
Baby born in ­rubble of Syria earthquake brings gift of life amid death and destruction,"The baby girl was born under the rubble as the number of those who died shot past 7,200 an international rescue effort was underway to try to save hundreds of people still buriedA girl born under the ­rubble of the Turkey-Syria earthquake yesterday brought a gift of life amid the death and destruction. But with the spectre of doom never far away in such disasters, the tot’s mother and family sadly perished. As the number of those who died shot past 7,800 an international rescue effort was underway to try to save hundreds of people still buried. They faced a race against time as experts fear the death toll could hit 20,000 with plunging temperatures and a danger of multiple aftershocks. At least three Brits are missing feared dead in Monday’s 7.8 quake, which ripped through around 200 miles of the Middle East. Rescuers plucked the baby girl from beneath a collapsed ­five-storey block of flats in Jindires, Syria, 10 hours after the quake struck.   The tot was still attached to mum Afraa Abu Hadiya by her ­umbilical cord. Rescuers ­separated the pair and the girl was rushed to hospital where she was last night recovering. Doctors said she was bruised but stable. In Kahramanmaras, Turkey, grieving father Mesut Hancer was seen clinging to his ­15-year-old daughter Irmak’s hand as she lay dead in the rubble. Nearby, five-year-old Ayse Kubra Gunes was pulled from the wreckage of the six-storey building where she lived. As she lay trapped, her father spoke to her and she bravely replied: “I’m fine here. I’m fine, Dad.” Ayse was finally rescued after seven hours. A 15-month-old baby was also pulled from the rubble in the city.  Foreign Secretary James Cleverley said 35 other British nationals have been affected by the earthquake but there was a “low”expectation of “large-scale UK casualties”. A team of 77 British search and rescue experts has joined the international effort. Rishi Sunak “pledged the UK’s steadfast support” to Turkish ­President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during a phone call. And the King said: “My wife and I have been most shocked and profoundly saddened by the news of the devastating earthquakes. I can only begin to imagine the scale of suffering and loss as a result of these dreadful tragedies. “I wanted to convey our deepest sympathy to the families of all those who have lost their loved ones. “Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone who has been affected by this appalling natural disaster.” ­Specialists from across Europe, Albania, ­Montenegro, Jordan and China have also offered their services to boost the 24,400 search and rescue teams already deployed by Turkey.  Even ­war-ravaged Ukraine pledged an 87-strong team to help out. Qatar offered 10,000 container ­shelters for people left homeless. Around 380,000 survivors are ­sheltering in government dormitories or hotels in Turkey. So far, 3,294 search and rescue teams from 14 countries have arrived to help the shattered region. They were being transferred to the worst-hit provinces of Hatay, ­Kahramanmaras and Adiyaman across Turkey. But disaster management agency ­official Orhan Tatar said: “The adverse weather conditions continue in the region. Therefore, from time to time it may be difficult to transport these teams to the region.”  Ten ships were helping the rescue efforts, by transporting the wounded to hospitals, mainly from the ­Mediterranean port of Iskenderun. Syrian Arab Red Crescent chief Khaled Hboubati urged the US and EU to lift years-old sanctions imposed on the war-torn country. He said: “This is the most ­important thing for us.” World Health ­Organisation ­emergencies head Dr Mike Ryan said: “The scale of this disaster requires a sustained response.  “And the secondary impacts are going to go on for months and months, especially for those people already affected, already vulnerable for many other reasons in the region, and especially in Syria.” Mr Erdogan declared a ­three-month state of ­emergency in 10 afflicted areas across Turkey and ordered seven days of mourning.

Nicola Bulley 'unlikely to be found in river and impossible for her to be in the sea',"Diving group Specialist Group International (SGI) have been searching ""large areas"" of water in the River Wye after being drafted in by police this week, with experts admitting the case is ""baffling""A specialist search diver has said Nicola Bulley is unlikely to be found in river and impossible for her to be in the sea as the mum remains missing 11 days after vanishing. Diving group Specialist Group International (SGI) have been searching ""large areas"" of water in the River Wye after being drafted in by police this week. Founder Peter Faulding, who was yesterday pictured operating the firm's high-tech side scan sonar from a boat, spoke to GB News saying it is ""unlikely"" she will be found in the water. He said: ""We've been using the high frequency side scan sonar in this stretch today and it's so detailed I can even see every stone of it. She's not in this stretch. “We also sonar-ed on the other side down yesterday in the tidal river. Now if you take a football on a tidal river…when the tide goes out the the ball will go down the stream and then as soon as the tide turns it will come back in again. It'll end up back at the same place. “For Nicola to get out to the sea would be impossible, literally, it is such a long way.”   Mr Faulding previously admitted there are many confusing elements, and prior to joining the search yesterday told the Mirror he expected SGI's equipment to find Nicola in under an hour if she was in fact in the river. He said all the police have to go on right now is Nicola's phone, which was left on a bench overlooking where investigators suggest she may have fallen in. Her dog was found wandering alone nearby, with her harness and lead removed. Speaking to TalkTV yesterday, Mr Faulding said: ""After 25 years of doing this kind of work, after hundreds of cases, I am well and truly baffled.  ""When people drown they generally go down where they are. We normally find them within five to ten metres of where they went down even after a few days. ""This is the most baffling case that I have ever worked on. The police have nothing to go on. ""All they have is a mobile phone at the moment and they said it could possibly be a decoy."" Nicola had dropped her two daughters at school in St Michaels on Wyre on the morning of January 27 and then took springer spaniel Willow for a walk along a river towpath.  She was seen for a final time by a witness at around 9.10am, having logged into a work conference call at just after the hour. At 9.33am another dog walker found her phone on a bench, with a distressed Willow nearby. Police subsequently launched a major search operation, which is now entering its 12th day.

He did not specify whether they were in Syria or Turkey.   He said: ""We know that three British nationals are missing and the Foreign Office's Crisis Response Hub is working to support the at least 35 British nationals who have been directly affected by these earthquakes.

Meanwhile, footage has emerged from Syria showing a baby girl taking her first breath surrounded by destruction, after her mother went into labour during the quake.  A miracle baby who was born under the rubble of collapsed buildings in Afrin, in the northeast of the country, has devastatingly been made an orphan as her parents did not make it out alive.

Victims of rapist cop David Carrick demand answers as they speak of relief he's jailed,"Some of David Carrick's victims have spoken out after the rapist police officer was jailed for 30 years as the Met Police are warned they could face possible legal actionA number of David Carrick's victims have hit out at the Metropolitan Police as they warn they are exploring potential legal action against the force and want a full inquiry.  The former officer has been jailed for 30 years for attacking a dozen women in an ""unrestrained campaign of rape and abuse"" over an 18-year period. The moment he was arrested while arrogantly telling police officers he has been on the force for two decades was released today. Now, the Centre for Women’s Justice are speaking with a number of victims of twisted Carrick. Some of those he attacked have reacted to his sentencing and demand a statutory inquiry.   They say one client - known as Joanna, which is not her real name - was repeatedly raped, abused and controlled over a period of time by Carrick. She said via the charity: “For the first time since my ordeal began, I feel able to hold my head up and walk proudly. It feels like the shadows of the past have finally disappeared after hounding me for the last seven years.  ""I feel lighter, both mentally and physically. I feel liberated and relieved. ""I am relieved to know he won’t be posing a danger to anyone else, anymore. He is a beast and he will be kept in an enclosure. But it is shameful that the ones who were in charge of his vetting, in a way allowed this predator to keep hunting, by using the cover of the police.  ""I feel that they are responsible for what happened to us. Yes, it was him who hurt us, but it was they who didn’t stop him in the first place, despite having many chances to do so.  ""It was their job to vet him and to investigate him. Instead, they let him carry on and abuse so many more of us.” Another victim, “Emma” - also not her real name - met Carrick in 2017 and kept her prisoner in his home for nearly a year, said today: “Justice has prevailed, he has got the sentence he deserves. But now we need answers from the Metropolitan Police and we need to see real change."" Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley today said the police force has ""let down women"" after disgraced officer Carrick was handed 36 life sentences.  The commissioner called the former officer's crimes ""unspeakably evil"". In a statement outside New Scotland Yard, Rowley said the ex cop had ""subjected these victims and survivors to the most degrading and inhumane treatment."" Rowley added: ""He should not have been a police officer. ""We weren’t rigorous enough in our approach and as a result we missed opportunities to identify the warning signs over decades. I want to again reiterate my apology on behalf of the Met. We are truly sorry."" The Centre for Women’s Justice said in a statement: ""While today’s sentencing is an important step for his victims in seeking justice, they and members of the public rightly have many further questions.   ""In particular, how was this man, who had been reported by an ex-partner for a domestic incident even before joining the police, allowed to become a police officer in 2000?  ""How is it possible, that despite three further reports to the police of domestic abuse allegations he was promoted to the parliamentary and diplomatic unit, a unit where he was issued with a gun and served alongside Wayne Couzens in 2009?  ""How did he pass his re-vetting in 2017, despite a further domestic abuse report only a year earlier? And how was it, that in 2021 when reported for rape, shortly after Couzens had been arrested for the rape and murder of Sarah Everard, he was still not suspended?  ""These questions need to be answered fully and frankly, because the failure to bring him to justice earlier, left him free to rape, abuse and control many more women.   ""Moreover, the lack of accountability, including a failure to consider whether those officers who considered Carrick suitable to be promoted and continue in his role may be guilty of misconduct is an additional insult to these women. ""Centre for Women’s Justice renews our call that there must be a statutory inquiry into police perpetrated violence against women.  ""The current inquiry, announced by the Home Secretary in October 2021 following the sentencing of Wayne Couzens, lacks the powers to tackle this issue properly. It simply does not have the confidence of the group most affected, namely women and girls.  ""We asked the previous Home Secretary to hold a statutory inquiry and she refused. While she has since changed her mind, the present Home Secretary has failed to respond to our correspondence asking again and offering to share our expertise. ""It is a disservice to Carrick’s incredibly brave victims and indeed all victims of police perpetrated abuse, that the government continues to fail to tackle this issue, which requires a thorough examination by way of a Statutory Inquiry first.""

Priests could stop using male pronouns 'He' and 'Him' when referring to God,"A project based on 'gendered language' in the Church is set to be launched and debated this spring, with the possibility it could include suggestions on the use of 'He' and 'Him' in reference to God.Priests could stop using male pronouns 'He' and 'Him' when referring to God. A project based on 'gendered language' in the Church of England is set to be launched and debated this spring, with the possibility it could include suggestions on the use of 'He' and 'Him' in reference to God. It may also suggest dropping or rephrasing 'our Father' from the start of the Lord's Prayer. However, changes are likely to spark strong pushback from traditionalists who are against breaking away from words used in the Bible. The landmark proposals were presented to the Liturgical Commission.- a committee that develops the wording used in church services.   The Rev Joanna Stobart, a vicar in the diocese of Guildford, Surrey, said: ""Please could the Liturgical Commission provide an update on the steps being taken to develop more inclusive language in our authorised liturgy and to provide more options for those who wish to use authorised liturgy and speak of God in a non-gendered way, particularly in authorised absolutions where many of the prayers offered for use refer to God using male pronouns?' In response, the Bishop of Lichfield, the Rt Rev Michael Ipgrave, said: ""We have been exploring the use of gendered language in relation to God for several years, in collaboration with the Faith and Order Commission. ""After some dialogue between the two Commissions in this area, a new joint project on gendered language will begin this spring.  ""In common with other potential changes to authorised liturgical provision, changing the wording and number of authorised forms of absolution would require a full Synodical process for approval."" Women and the Church (WATCH) said: ""WATCH welcomes the start of another project in the Church of England to look at the development of more inclusive language in our authorised liturgy. 'We hope that a proposal will be brought to Synod soon, as we believe that a theological misreading of God as exclusively male is a driver of much continuing discrimination and sexism against women.""  But Synod member Rev Dr Ian Paul said: ""The fact that God is called 'Father' can't be substituted by 'Mother' without changing meaning, nor can it be gender-neutralised to 'Parent' without loss of meaning.

"Grandad of baby, boy, 2, and girl, 4, stabbed in home gives update on kids' condition","A three-month-old baby, a two-year-old boy and a four-year-old boy were found with stab wounds in a home in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, on Monday, as their family gave an updateThe grandparents of three young children found stabbed in their home, including a tiny three-month-old baby boy, have spoken of their ‘shock’. Police were called to a home in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, on Monday by ambulance crews. As well as the baby boy, a two-year-old and a four-year-old were found with stab wounds, and a 34-year-old woman remains under arrest. The children’s grandmother told reporters she was ‘shocked’ when she heard of the incident, Yorkshire Live reported. She said: “We are still all in shock. “The children are OK, they’re recovering. As long as they’re OK, that’s all that matters.”  Their grandfather added: “My wife woke me up yesterday morning. Her brother had been in touch to say ‘something has happened to the grandchildren’. “We are all in shock, really shocked. I saw the little one yesterday at the hospital in Leeds and gave him a cuddle."" Today the home where the children were found remained under police guard, with the Homicide and Major Enquiry Team continuing enquiries.  A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police said: ""A woman remains under arrest as enquiries continue into the attempted murder of three children in Huddersfield.   “The Homicide and Major Enquiry Team continue to investigate a serious incident at Walpole Road on Monday, February 6, in which a four-year-old girl, two-year-old boy and a three-month-old male baby were found with serious stab injuries. ""The three-month-old baby continues to be treated for non-life-threatening injuries as does the four-year-old girl. “The two-year-old boy is described as being in a serious but stable condition. “A 34-year-old woman was treated for injuries and remains under arrest on suspicion of attempted murder."" The incident has left residents in the road shocked, with many sharing their thoughts earlier. One Walpole Road resident, who asked not to be named, said: ""I just knew (the family) to say hi to - they seem like good people.  “Another neighbour said: ""I don't know the lady but I've seen her when I've been taking my kids to school and we'd greet each other, she's good. I was very, very shocked."" Neighbour Vincent Jones, 86, who has lived in the street for more than 40 years added: ""I saw the ambulance out there and they were taking a woman away. The ambulance woke me up at about 8am. ""She was wrapped in blankets. There were loads of ambulances and police cars."" ""I saw them about, but not to have a conversation with. They would say hello and that's it. ""I saw her running up and down with the two children and she had another one recently, about Christmas time.

'I died for 27 minutes and what I saw in the afterlife wasn't scary - it was incredible',"Mum Tina Hines had a cardiac arrest on her driveway in Arizona, US, and 'died' several times on the way to hospital before doctors revived her one final time and asked for a penA woman who died for nearly half an hour was brought back to life by doctors - and immediately wrote down a heartwarming message about the afterlife.  Tina Hines had a cardiac arrest when she fell on her driveway but was revived by her husband, Dave, and a neighbour who performed CPR. On the way to hospital she died for a total of 27 minutes as paramedics worked to keep her alive and a doctor used a defibrillator in hospital to bring her around a sixth time. When she woke up she asked for a pen and paper and scribbled a note which simply said ‘It’s real,’ Christian Broadcasting Network reported.   Dave said of the ordeal: “She just started making marks, and I couldn't tell what it was, and I was almost shaking. I was fixed. I just held the book steady because I didn't want it to drop."" ""We figured out she wrote I-T-S-R-E-A-L. 'What's it's real?' And I go, 'The pain? The hospital?' She's slowly nodding your head. Eyes are closed. She's fully vented. “No, and then my daughter goes, 'Heaven?' And she goes – she nods yes."" Tina added of the 2018 experience: “I just wanted to share I saw Jesus face to face and the unbelievable rest and peacefulness of what I was experiencing was Jesus standing there with his arms open wide, and right behind Jesus standing there was this incredible glow it was the most vibrant and beautiful yellow.""  She was discharged four days later having made a full recovery and is now training for a half marathon. Last month a woman who was clinically dead for over fourteen minutes claimed she saw a mountain range '30,000 times bigger than Mount Everest' in the afterlife. Dr Lynda Cramer was on the way to her bathroom before she 'died' in the early hours of the morning on May 6, 2001. However, she claims her journey did not stop there and she went to heaven during the time paramedics rushed to save her. Once resuscitated, she shared all that she had seen during an experience she felt had lasted five years.   Recalling what happened in an interview with  NDE Diary  on Youtube, Dr Cramer claims she floated above paramedics working on her body, before she explored the afterlife, where she could take any form she chose.  She also spoke about several of the striking sights she saw, many of which could not be rivalled on earth. Recounting one experience, Dr Cramer said: ""That's when I found myself standing in what I termed the the field of flowers. I was observing the mountain range 30,000 times huger than Mount Everest. ""There's a huge mountain range over in the back of wherever I was. I could see buildings with skyscrapers. Dubai are like little miniature huts in comparison. “I saw lakes, I could see everything in a panoramic view."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/i-died-27-minutes-what-29158744
"Girl, 7, becomes youngest person in the world to be diagnosed with breast cancer","The mother of the youngster, from Chile, first found a lump on her daughter's breast when she was five and she has now undergone an operation to remove the affected areaA young girl is believed to have become the youngest ever diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of seven. The young patient’s mother first noticed a small lump on her daughter’s chest when she was five-years-old as she bathed her. Two years later it was confirmed as breast cancer and she later underwent an operation to remove the affected tissue. The mum, from Chile, said: “While drying her and putting on cream, I noticed a little lump under her nipple. ""The doctor told me that this was not normal and that it would grow if it was left for a long time, but he never told me it would come to this.   “My daughter is now mutilated and that is the pain I have to live with. ""The only thing she mentions to me when I take her to the oncologist is that she doesn't want to be bald. ""Beyond that, she doesn't understand that she has lost her breast."" The family is currently waiting for test results to find out if the tumour had started to metastasise. If the girl's diagnosis does not improve, the family said they will visit specialists in Barcelona who have experience in treating young cancer patients.  Paediatric haematologist and oncologist Francisco Barriga said: ""Most women who are diagnosed with breast cancer are aged between 50 and 60. ""From there, it starts to appear less frequently, and a case of a child under 7 years of age is completely anecdotal."" Felipe Tagle, president of the Chilean Association of Cancer Patients, added many doctors did not want to take the case on because of her age.  Last week it was reported a mum with terminal  cancer  has created a 'wish list' of things to do before she dies, including seeing her baby boy write his first word.  Danni Day, 34, was told that she'd never be able to have children after going through chemotherapy for breast cancer in 2017 but later fell pregnant with son Bodhi. The graphic designer from Loddon, Norfolk, has now began making small plans for the next two years and would love to take Bodhi abroad for the first time. She said: “We were devastated when we found out the cancer had returned. I was so close to hitting my five-year recovery mark. ""We were just completely blown away. Having Bodhi as well changed my perspective on things."" ""I want to potty train Bodhi and see him write a word before I go.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/girl-7-becomes-youngest-person-29159547

Hero mum in fatal crash returns to car to rescue daughter despite breaking BOTH her feet,"Erica Nocella battled through her own horrific pain, including a broken sternum, to pulled her daughter Dahlia, four, from the wreckage with the little girl suffering a broken arm and a cut to her pancreasA mum in fatal crash returned to her car to rescue her daughter despite breaking both her feet. Erica Nocella pulled her daughter Dahlia, four, from the wreckage with the little girl suffering a broken arm and a cut to her pancreas. The heroic mum managed to battle through her own pain of two broken feet and a broken sternum during the horror crash on their way to a train station in Surrey on January 8.   Speaking about the crash, Erica told SurreyLive: ""Everything is normal and then you see this thing in front of you. I was aware of everything. Instinctively I tried to brake which explains the two broken feet. I just felt the  airbag hit my face quite hard and then obviously I thought about Dahlia. “I called her but she wasn’t answering so instinctively I got out of the car with my two broken feet. I don't know what it was, maybe adrenaline, but I went to the back and she was scared. She wasn’t understanding what was going on.   “She said to me ‘what’s going on?’ I just got her out of the car and walked away, I couldn’t feel a thing. It’s quite normal for a mum to make sure her children are safe.  ""I saw when they tried to help the people in the other car and obviously I was hoping that they were fine, but then I heard an ambulance staff saying he wasn’t breathing.”  Both Erica, her partner Thaniel and her daughter were taken to St George’s Hospital, in Tooting, for treatment and  the mum has been at her daughter's bedside at King's Paediatric Liver Centre.  Police confirmed one man sadly died in the crash. Dahlia is still unable to eat properly and has to be fed through a tube that goes inside her nose to her stomach. Thaniel suffered a broken hand and broken hips in the incident but is recovering well.  They have not returned home since the crash and although Dahlia is expected to make a full recovery Erica said the past few weeks had been an “emotional rollercoaster.” She is still not sure when she and her daughter can return home. “One day they say they can do this, the other it’s ‘she’s getting worse.’ It’s been very up and down. It’s been very heavy and very tough. We know, thank God, that she will recover. It's just that it will take a bit of time.   “She's scared of doctors, she’s developed a phobia of needles in here and has gone through a lot. Every time she hears a doctor or nurse she’s scared. Dahlia isn’t very open at the moment to speak with people, for three weeks she wasn’t even talking.”  Erica has been unable to operate her cleaning business due to her injuries, which force her to use crutches or a wheelchair and being by Dahlia’s side. Friends have since set up a GoFundMe page to help get them “back on their feet” following the crash which has received £2,851 in donations so far. It reads: ""The shock from the accident and the injuries do not make the journey easy for Erika [sic]. Erica is a single mum; she has been living in England for many years and working hard to provide for Dahlia and herself. She recently started a cleaning business, which is no longer possible to continue - she is now left with no income at all and unable to work to support her little family.""

Furious resident vows to move after parking space is moved half a mile away from home,"Medway Council's permit office are duty bound to provide parking for certain residents and Matt Clubb is so angry he says he will move from his home in Chatham, KentA man has vowed to pack his bags after his local council moved his parking space half-a-mile from his home. Matt Clubb is so angry at the prospect of leaving his car in a seven-floor multi-storey he says he will move. The digital portfolio manager claims Chatham, Kent, isn't safe enough after dark to walk alone - and would rather leave the town all together than accept the new spot. The resident only agreed to move in four years ago because the tenancy came with free parking yards from his door. But now he will have to walk to and from the busy Pentagon shopping centre if he wants to use his car.   The motorist even offered to pay for a residents' parking space nearby but was told that wasn't possible. He had lived at the two-bedroom flat at Imperial Gate since 2018 but his stay in Chatham may be coming to an end. Mr Clubb told KentOnline that he would rather find a new property than do the big trip twice a day. He told the publication: ""I am now having to find a new home as I cannot be walking at night half-a-mile to my car. ""Chatham is not safe in the day, let alone at night. ""The permits office response is always the same, they are required to provide parking but no stipulation as to how far away it is.""  A spokesman for Medway Council said: ""We are currently looking into the resident’s complaint. ""It would be inappropriate for us to comment whilst we’re looking into this matter."" It's not the only parking problem to arise in recent weeks. A livid granddad says he will have to pay £12.50 every time he leaves his driveway as an Ultra Low Emission Zone is expanded to his area. Paul Savage, 77, has hit out at Mayor of London Sadiq Khan’s plans to expand the 'ULEZ' to his home borough of Harrow, calling it “frustrating” as he says he he will now have to pay £12.50 any time he wants to leave his home by car. Paul said: “As soon as I come out of my drive I’ll have to pay £12.50. ""I’m retired so I don’t need a car very often but I am going to have to get a smaller one.” The charge will affect other members of Paul's family, including his grandchildren, who will now have to go to school by public transport - and he said local people can do nothing to stop the charge.

"Pigeons are so smart their brains can rival Artificial Intelligence, experts say","A new study has discovered pigeons are one of the smartest creatures on the planet after some of the birds solved complex tests after memorising scenarios, according to expertsThe pigeon has a brain that rivals artificial intelligence. A study found the animal is one of the smartest creatures despite inspiring the insult “birdbrain”. Pigeons were given complex tests that high-level thinking such as logic or reasoning would not solve. They turned to trial and error, memorising scenarios. Experts equate it to AI that uses the basic methodology. Machines are “taught” to identify patterns and objects. Making associations – low-level thinking – is the same. Prof Ed Wasserman, of the University of Iowa, said: “The pigeons are like AI masters.” Four pigeons were shown a stimulus and had to decide, by pecking a button, on the correct category.   They included line width, angle and concentric rings. A right answer yielded a pellet. Prof Wasserman said: “These stimuli don’t look like one another and they’re never repeated. You have to memorise individual stimuli to do the task.”  The study in Current Biology said each bird answered about half correctly at the beginning but over hundreds of tests  got an average of 68% right.   If people took the test they would likely do badly and give up. They prefer declarative learning, reason using rules. Dolphins and chimps may also use high-level thinking.

Millions 'will feel like they're living in a recession' even if UK avoids one,"The National Institute of Economic and Social Research issues its latest quarterly briefing - warning of misery for households across the UK and attacking Tory levelling-up claimsThe cost-of-living crisis will “feel like” a recession for seven million people even if Britain technically avoids one, experts warn today. Issuing its quarterly monthly outlook, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research claims the UK “will likely avoid a protracted recession” this year - but economic growth “will remain close to zero” at just 0.2%. It warns: “We project that seven million UK households - one in four - will be unable to meet in full their planned energy and food bills from their post-tax income in 2023-24, up from around one in five in 2022-23.” Unemployment is set to rise from 3.7% to 4.7% by autumn 2024. Middle-income families will suffer up to a £4,000 hit to their finances, with 10.7% inflation and the Bank of England’s 4% base interest rate - a 14-year high - hammering households. The NIESR adds: “With the cost-of-living crisis having a lasting effect on households, for at least seven million people it will certainly feel like a recession.” Read More
  The poorest fifth of households have seen their disposable income plunge by 18% since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, compared with 9% for the richest fifth - worsening inequality. And while London’s productivity is due to have increased since the start of the Covid-19 crisis, it is expected to have dropped in the East Midlands and West Midlands. Highlighting regional differences hitting key Red Wall areas, the charity says the North East “will see significant destitution” by the end of 2024, with 30% of households there facing “extreme poverty”. Analysts said “anaemic growth and persistent inflation continue to damage UK households”. The think tank forecasts price rises will still be running above 3% at the end of next year, with inflation not returning to the Bank’s 2% target until summer 2025. NIESR deputy director Professor Adrian Pabst said that when inflation fell, prices did not tumble.  “Even when inflation comes back down to something like 2% - as indeed it will - price levels will remain high,” he warned. “Food and energy will become permanently more expensive.” Hard-up families will be forced into “drawing on savings or going into further debt to cope”, he feared. Fewer workers will be able to afford to retire early, while “workers in the 50 to 64 age group return to the labour force” having previously taken early retirement, according to its forecast. NIESR director Jagjit Chada blamed Brexit, the pandemic and the war in Ukraine for the economic misery dogging Britain as warned of a “permanent reduction in our standard of living”. “Consistently we are getting these downward shocks that are scarring the economy,” he said. “The shocks that have come along have progressively made us poorer per person.” Prof Pabst added: “Low-income households have seen their disposable income fall by nearly 20% since the onset of Covid. “Those worst affected tend to live in some of the most economically deprived areas of the country, including parts of the three devolved nations and the North-East of England whereas London and the conurbations of the South East power ahead.  “We are also seeing the return of the ‘squeezed middle’ - middle-income households who are losing out most from an escalation in the price level and the increase in the Bank rate from 0.1% to 4%.” He took aim at government claims about levelling-up - a flagship Tory policy in the 2019 election. “We’re not levelling-up, we are seeing widening regional inequalities,” he said. “We seem to be levelling-down.” He called on ministers to pump various levelling-up funds into one pot of cash and create a National Investment Bank with £50billion of finance. * Follow Mirror Politics on Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter and Facebook ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/millions-will-feel-like-theyre-29156702
Firefighters will set dates for first strike in 20 years unless they get pay offer TODAY,"The Fire Brigades Union has warned if there is not a 'significant shift' at a last ditch meeting with employers today then they will announce the dates of strike actionFirefighters have warned they will announce dates for strike action unless they are offered a proper pay rise at crunch talks today. Members of the Fire Brigades Union have voted to hold their first nationwide walkouts in 20 years. The union has called for a “significant shift” after station and control room staff rejected a below inflation 5% pay offer. Representatives from the FBU will meet with fire service chiefs today in a last ditch bid to avoid industrial action. The union said it hopes to resolve the dispute without a strike and is giving employers chance to come forward with an improved offer. If the talks fail, strike dates are expected to be announced tomorrow.   FBU general secretary Matt Wrack, said: ""The strength of feeling among firefighters is clear, with an 88% vote in favour of strikes by FBU members, and 94% in Northern Ireland. ""That's one of the biggest mandates for industrial action by a trade union in recent years. ""The reason for that massive vote to strike is simple: firefighters are dealing with financial hardship and the growing threat of 'in work' poverty, with a real-terms cut to their wages. ""They are struggling to pay the bills during the cost-of-living crisis that this Government is presiding over. ""Going on strike is an absolute last resort for firefighters. ""However, this action can still be avoided if the employers make an offer which addresses the concerns of firefighters. ""The FBU is adopting an open-minded and constructive approach to the talks today, having already delayed strike action by 10 days to allow employers to meet us. ""Industrial action is not inevitable if the employers genuinely engage with the FBU about the anger among firefighters about poverty pay and improve their offer to address our concerns. ""However, firefighters will not be messed about, and the Government and employers cannot ride roughshod over the 88% vote for strikes by FBU members. ""If there is no significant shift from the employers, then strikes will be announced on Thursday. ""The responsibility for any disruption to services would then firmly lie with fire service employers and government ministers for not delivering a serious pay offer."" * Follow Mirror Politics on Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter and Facebook.

"Arrest may be imminent in search for missing X Factor star Levi Davis, investigator says","Gavin Burrows says he is naming names in a damning expose containing evidence the rugby player and X-Factor star had been blackmailed by criminals and threatened over a Somali mafia debt.A private detective leading the hunt for missing Levi Davis says he believes an arrest may be imminent on the back of a bombshell report investigators are sending to Spanish police. Gavin Burrows says he is naming names in a damning expose containing evidence the rugby player and X-Factor star had been blackmailed by criminals and threatened over a Somali mafia debt. Mr Burrows, whose Line of Inquiry firm is offering a £10,000 reward for information that could lead to Levi being found, said last night: “I believe Spanish police will have enough to make an arrest when they see what our own investigation has thrown up. “At the very least it should give them enough to haul someone in for questioning. “I’m not at liberty at the moment to go public with any names but there is one person in particular that I have grave suspicions about and believe can shed light on what has happened to Levi.   “That person is someone who while pretending to help has in my view been nothing but an obstacle in trying to prevent our investigations from moving forward.” Levi, 24, spoke about being blackmailed by criminals who threatened to kill him and his family in a chilling last video he initially deleted but re-emerged last week three months after he vanished in Barcelona. He was last seen leaving an Irish pub on October 29 after taking a ferry from Ibiza. Mr Burrows said he had retrieved the Instagram video, which Levi first posted four days before he vanished, and released it with the agreement of family and friends to help get information. The ex-Bath rugby player says at the start of the 15-minute footage: “Hello my name is Levi Davis and my life is in danger.” before going on to allege he believed he was filmed performing various sexual acts after being drugged which blackmailers used to control and manipulate him.  He said: “I was told by them in ways which are not direct but are absolutely true that they were going to attempt - if I said anything out - they were going to attempt to kill me, threaten my family. “And they also were trying to frame me.” The Somali mafia reports first surfaced in Spain shortly before the chilling video twist to the high-profile disappearance, with respected Catalan newspaper La Vanguardia saying Levi owed around £100,000 after his lifestyle spiralled out of control. They coincided with claims Levi could have drowned in Barcelona’s port near to where his passport was found, although Mr Burrows described it last night as a theory and said it was also possible he was still alive and being forced to work as a courier by the gang he had got into debt with. He said: “Our relationship with the Catalan police has not been as close as we’d have liked it to have been but we’re hopeful that’s going to change now because we can deal with them much more directly and not go through people Levi’s mum has confirmed to us have no mandate to speak on anyone’s behalf.  “It makes it far more likely we can assist in getting a quicker resolution to this very worrying case.” Depressed Levi was taking a break in Europe after being sidelined from rugby following a knee injury. He was picked up on CCTV leaving the Old Irish Pub near Barcelona’s La Rambla around 10pm on October 29, a few hours after taking a boat from Ibiza with just 40 euros (£35) and no change of clothes. A friend who formally reported him missing to cops in Barcelona after his family informed West Midlands police, described his decision to leave the island as “sudden.” Last week it emerged Levi’s Instagram had up to 38 contacts mysteriously deleted after he vanished.  Levi played Premiership rugby union for Bath between 2017 and 2020, when he joined Ealing Trailfinders. A year later he signed for Worthing Raiders. The rugby player-turned-reality star performed on X Factor: Celebrity in 2019 with fellow rugby players Ben Foden and Thom Evans as part of the group Try Star. In 2020, the year he made history by becoming the first rugby union player to come out as bisexual while still playing, he appeared on the E4 dating series Celebs Go Virtual Dating.

Russia 'massing troops and weapons' as first anniversary of Ukraine invasion looms,"The warning came from Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey as he addressed the Royal United Services Institute in London, revealing what Labour would do in powerRussia is “massing troops and fire power” for a renewed attack in Ukraine as the first anniversary of the invasion looms, Labour warned tonight. Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey told military experts that “a year on, there is no sign (Vladimir) Putin’s strategic aims have changed”. Speaking at the London-based Royal United Services Institute, he said: “Putin is expanding his war effort, massing troops and fire power for further offensives with his industry on wartime production.” Pointing to the Kremlin’s 2014 annexing of Crimea and support for Moscow-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine, Mr Healey added: “Ukraine has been fighting Russia for nine years now, not one. “This is long term. “The next Government will inherit the Ukraine conflict and Russia’s wider aggression.” Read More
  He warned that “Russia is far from a spent force, despite the massive damage Ukraine has inflicted on its military.” But while he backed the Tories’ support for Kyiv, the Labour frontbencher said that “in truth, there has been a void in government vision about ‘what next?’” Attacking Conservative cuts to Army troop numbers and tanks, he called on ministers to switch tack in next month’s Budget and the latest Integrated Review of defence and foreign policy. “No country comes out of a war as it went in and there’s been strategic inertia from British ministers over any domestic or international rethink,” said Mr Healey. “The central question is, ‘Can this Government rise to respond to this challenge in next month’s new Integrated Review and Spring Budget, or are ministers too concerned with week-to-week survival to face the major decisions to secure the country’s future?’”  He also urged the Conservatives to refocus on Europe rather than deploying the military to the Indo-Pacific as part of a post-Brexit strategy. “The Tories’ post-Brexit blind spot on Europe must be corrected, we must rebuild relationships with our European allies to make Brexit work,” he said. “Just as we would not expect Japan or Australia to deploy much of their military to Europe, nor does it make sense – especially at this moment – for UK forces to devote an increasing share of their scarce resources to the Indo-Pacific.” * Follow Mirror Politics on Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter and Facebook ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/russia-massing-troops-weapons-first-29157221
'Rishi Sunak siding with oil and gas giants tells us all we need to know about Tories',"The case for a proper windfall tax on the corporate cash machine is overwhelming with BP's profits more than doubling, it tells us all we need to know about the ToriesOil and gas giant BP’s profits more than doubling to £23billion are the profits of war, fuelled by Putin’s invasion of Ukraine increasing world prices. The case for a proper windfall tax on the corporate cash machine is overwhelming when those soaring profits are not the result of extra investment or ingenuity. With many households and businesses facing even higher energy bills this spring, BP’s excess profits could help soften blow. Rishi Sunak and his government siding with BP, Shell, British Gas and the other behemoths lobbying against a more effective tax tells us all we need to know about the Tories.   The PM’s Conservatives champion corporate self-interest and are a major obstacle to building a fairer, more decent country.

Her “lazy” father Alun Titford shared the blame with her mother for the death of their 'independent' disabled daughter who had been left to die in Newtown, Wales. The removal man 45, was found guilty by a jury at Mold crown court after denying the charge. However, his partner of more than 20 years Sarah Lloyd-Jones, aged 40, a community care worker, admitted manslaughter.   Although just 4ft 10, the teen weighed almost 23 stone and her body mass index was 70 - a normal BMI being 20 to 25. The jury heard how Kaylea wasn’t seen in the last nine months of her life by a medical professional and hadn’t returned to school in September 2020. She’d been left lying in squalor by her parents, with maggots and flies in her cluttered room. Titford accepted in evidence that he was lazy and “failed’ his daughter as much as her mum. The teen had spina bifida and depended on others to care for her welfare but she was fed takeaway food – Indian, Chinese and kebabs - four or five nights a week which would lead to weight gain.  The prosecution said the parents’ failures were hidden from the outside world because of the national Covid lockdown. The court heard that Kaylea had attended Newtown High School, where she was described as “funny and chatty” by staff, but did not return following the coronavirus lockdown in March 2020. The prosecution alleged that Kaylea had not used her wheelchair, which became too small for her, since the start of lockdown. By the time of her death, Kaylea was immobile in her soiled bed. Her hair was dirty and matted and her toenails had not been cut for at least six months. Her skin was severely inflamed and ulcerated.  Prosecutor Caroline Rees KC said Kaylea couldn’t access her bathroom and toilet and lay in her own human waste. “It must have been an entirely wretched experience which you wouldn’t wish on any animal, let alone a vulnerable disabled child.” She was “trapped” in her grim room, parts of her “rotting alive” as police noticed a foul smell. A Home Office pathologist said the cause of death was as a result of inflammation and infection in extensive areas of ulceration arising from obesity and its complications, and immobility in a girl with spina bifida and hydrocephalus. An expert described it as the most severe case of pressure ulceration she had ever seen.  Kaylea didn’t have a nominated “key worker”and a social worker at one stage agreed with her mother that there was no role for the child disabilities team. She was last seen at home by a social worker in 2017 and discharged in 2018 from the NHS dietetic service. The jury heard there had been a Facebook message from Kaylea the night before she died. Ten seconds later her mobile phone was “locked.” Titford disputed that Kaylea had been stuck in bed during lockdown, but agreed he let her down. He claimed he couldn’t smell the awful decay and he hadn’t thought she needed medical attention. Trial judge Mr Justice Martin Alexander Griffiths said after the jury’s verdict :”I will not pass sentence on the defendant today. I need more information before I can do that. I will pass sentence in Swansea crown court on March 1 against this defendant and Sarah Lloyd-Jones who has pleaded guilty.  ”There can be no doubt this case passes the custody threshold. I do have a pre-sentence report on Sarah Lloyd-Jones, so I have full information about Alun Titford I will have a pre-sentence report on him too. “That doesn’t mean anything other than a custodial sentence will be passed.” He was granted conditional bail. The judge told jurors who took seven hours to find him guilty the subject was “unusually distressing.” He granted a ten-year exemption from jury service and highlighted potential help for them if they felt upset. Powys county council said yesterday, more than two years after the tragedy :”Following the conclusion of court proceedings, a concise child practice review is to be carried out and will involve all relevant agencies following a clear statutory framework.  ""The local authority does not feel able to comment until this process has been completed.” NSPCC Cymru Assistant Director Tracey Holdsworth said: “No child should be subjected to the horrific treatment Kaylea Titford was prior to her tragic death. The conscious, prolonged neglect by those who should have cared for her is incredibly distressing. “Research shows that young people with disabilities are three times more at risk of abuse, and while Kaylea’s parents are to blame for her death this case shows why having effective safeguarding systems in place across our communities is crucial. “A Child Safeguarding Practice Review must leave no stone unturned in establishing what more could have been done to protect Kaylea and, crucially, ensure that other children do not suffer such appalling neglect unnoticed.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/kaylea-titford-how-independent-teen-29156762
King Charles' portrait on Royal Mail stamps show 'defining part' of monarch's reign,"For the first time Charles’ portrait will appear on stamps in his role as monarch, and the simple, uncluttered design draws inspiration from stamps that featured the late QueenThe image of the King which will feature on first and second class stamps has been revealed with a Royal Mail executive describing it as a “defining part” of his reign. For the first time Charles’ portrait will appear on stamps in his role as monarch, and the simple, uncluttered design draws inspiration from stamps that featured the late Queen. David Gold, Royal Mail’s director of external affairs and policy, said they received guidance from the King to maintain “continuity” and Charles did not want existing stamp stocks showing the Queen pulped, but used up over time. The new stamp design features Charles’ head and neck and the King is shown facing left as all monarchs have done since the Penny Black, the world’s first postage stamp, was issued in 1840 with Queen Victoria’s image. Mr Gold said: ""The guidance we got from His Majesty was more about continuity and not doing anything too different to what had gone before.   ""I think perhaps there’s an acknowledgement that, for 70 years people have been so used to seeing the image of Her Majesty, even though actually the current image only started in 1967, they didn’t want to do anything too different to what had gone before. ""Personally, I think what marks this stamp out is that there is no embellishment at all, no crown, just simply the face of the human being, on the plain background, almost saying, ‘this is me and I’m at your service’, which I think in this modern age is actually rather humbling."" The King’s image is used on definitive stamps, sometimes referred to as “every day” stamps, that have just the monarch’s head and value of the stamp on a plain coloured background with a barcode alongside.   British artist Martin Jennings made a profile sculpture of Charles for the Royal Mint who were creating UK coins and a team for the Royal Mail adapted an image of the artwork, adjusting and relighting the picture for use on the new stamps. Commenting on the efforts of the Royal Mail team who began working on the project following the Queen’s death in September, Mr Gold added: “I don’t underestimate how challenging it was for them. ""But also I know that I can say on their behalf how privileged they felt to be able to work on this project... it will forever be a part of history. It’s a clear, defining part of the reign of King Charles."" The stamps go on sale from April 4 but collectors and the general public can now register their interest on Royal Mail’s website.  Post offices and other retailers will not start selling the new stamps until their stocks featuring the late Queen are sold. Mr Gold said: ""The King gave very clear directions he didn’t want anything to be pulped, he didn’t want things being shredded, he didn’t want stock being thrown away. ""He was very clear, however long it takes you to clear the stock there’s no rush, and that’s entirely in line with his well stated principles on waste and environmentalism.” The new first class stamp will form part of an exhibition at London’s Postal Museum about the nation’s definitive stamps called The King’s Stamp, which runs until September 23. The display will celebrate the newest stamp design with a unique chance to see a sheet of King Charles III first class stamps before they are in public circulation.

"Two million children in poverty due to parents facing work barriers, charity warns","Researchers found work is often not a route out of hardship for families where both parents or a single parent is already working full-time, have long-term sickness or disability, or caring responsibilitiesAlmost two million children could be trapped in poverty because their parents face at least one major barrier to work, according to new research. The charity Action for Children said the research clashes with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's statement that creating jobs ""is the best anti-poverty strategy"". Researchers found work is often not a route out of hardship for families where both parents or a single parent is already working full-time, have long-term sickness or disability, or caring responsibilities. Indeed, 440,000 children are in poverty despite their parents or single parent working full-time, while an additional 641,000 youngsters are in poverty where at least one parent is disabled. The research found 1.36 million children in poverty are in families with one barrier to work, while 495,000 youngsters are in families with two barriers, and 95,000 are in those that face three.   The report also found the benefit cap, which limits the total benefits a household can receive even if their entitlement would otherwise be higher, is a ""big driver"" of deeper poverty. It recommends abolishing the cap completely, and raising the child element of universal credit by at least £15 a week. The researchers estimate these measures would lift 340,000 children out of poverty, while costing the Government £4 billion. Imran Hussain, the charity's director of policy and campaigns, said work is not the ""silver bullet"" for poverty that it is often presented as. ""To improve the lives and life chances of all children we need to be honest about why so many are growing up in poverty and hardship,"" he said. ""We must confront the myth that everyone in poverty can simply work their way out of it. ""Our findings show that when it comes to supporting families in financial distress, work is simply not the silver bullet it is often presented as. We need more realism and less rhetoric from Government in how we talk about the relationship between poverty and work. ""And we need a social safety net that ensures families can meet their essential costs and restores the link between a family's needs and the support that is available to them.""

Breakthrough for prostate cancer as new blood test shows an accuracy rate of 94%,"A pilot study of 147 patients evaluated the new test and found it notably improved detection of the disease and could now help more men identify the cancerA new prostate cancer test with a 94% accuracy rate could help identify more men with the disease. Experts said the standard PSA blood test can result in unnecessary biopsies and “false reassurance in men with cancer”. But a chromosomal PSE test was said to significantly improve detection.  A team from Imperial College and the University of East Anglia advised combining them. A pilot study of 147 patients evaluated the new test, called PSE, and found it significantly improved detection of the disease. All the men in the study had prostate cancer and the test was 94% accurate. The next stage of research will be to use the test on a group of men where the cancer status is unknown.   Professor Dmitry Pshezhetskiy, from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said: ""Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and kills one man every 45 minutes in the UK. ""There is currently no single test for prostate cancer, but PSA blood tests are among the most used, alongside physical examinations, MRI scans and biopsies. ""However, PSA blood tests are not routinely used to screen for prostate cancer, as results can be unreliable.  ""Only about a quarter of people who have a prostate biopsy due to an elevated PSA level are found to have prostate cancer. ""There has therefore been a drive to create a new blood test with greater accuracy. ""When tested in the context of screening a population at risk, the PSE test yields a rapid and minimally invasive prostate cancer diagnosis with impressive performance. This suggests a real benefit for both diagnostic and screening purposes.""  Dr Jon Burrows, chief executive at Oxford Biodynamics, said: ""There is a clear need in everyday clinical practice for a highly accurate blood test that can screen men for prostate cancer and accurately identify those at risk, while sparing those who up to now would be subject to unnecessary, expensive and invasive procedures."" Publishing their findings in the journal Cancers, the team said the PSA test currently widely used in the NHS does not have sufficient accuracy, resulting in numerous unnecessary prostate biopsies in men with no cancer and ""false reassurance in some men with cancer"". The researchers developed a new chromosomal test which can pick up signals of cancer and combined it with the regular PSA test.

Nicola Bulley police extend search to the sea after divers couldn't find her in river,"Superintendent Sally Riley said the search has been extended to the sea after no trace of Nicola Bulley was found in the River Wyre, despite an expert dive squad being called inPolice looking for missing mum Nicola Bulley have extended the search to the sea after an expert dive squad couldn't find her in the River Wyre. It comes as the top investigator said yesterday detectives had ruled out any foul play. The 45-year-old vanished on a dog walk in St Michaels on Wyre on January 27, with her phone found on a bench overlooking the water. A major search effort has been launched, which includes drafting in independent underwater forensic experts Specialist Group International this week. Firm chief Peter Faulding previously told the Mirror his team's sonar could find Nicola in under an hour if she is in the river - however, he expressed doubts she ever fell in. He added that he considered it almost impossible that she would have been dragged down to the estuary, hypothesising that a body would become ""snagged"" within 500 metres of the entry point.   His team yesterday trawled what they consider the ""hot zone"", as well several miles up and downstream, but neither they nor police specialists found any evidence of Nicola. Separate dive teams have since begun searching up towards Morecambe Bay, the officer overseeing the investigation revealed last night. Lancashire Police Superintendent Sally Riley also told a press briefing on Tuesday the force continued to rule out any ""suspicious or criminal"" element to the case.  She said a team of 40 detectives are working on around 500 different lines of inquiry and are identifying more than 700 drivers who travelled through the village around the time Nicola disappeared. She said: ""This is normal in a missing person inquiry and does not indicate that there is any suspicious element to this story. ""The inquiry team remains fully open-minded to any information that may indicate where Nicola is or what happened to her.""  But the police chief emphasised that detectives have not yet come across any evidence of foul play. ""Any criminal or suspicious element has been discarded,"" she said. ""It is important to stress that any information that comes in that indicates otherwise is being checked out all the time. ""We are not closed in any way to any particular line of inquiry but all these extensive inquiries, however, have so far found anything of note.""

UK weather: Snow like 'Beast from the East' could be sparked by MAJOR incoming event,"New long-range forecasts from the Met Office have indicated the beginning of a major Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW), which could cause a repeat of the 'Beast from the East' snowstormA new weather event could soon bring on snowy conditions similar to the infamous 'Beast from the East'. New long-range forecasts from the Met Office have indicated the beginning of a major Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW), which sees rapid warming occur high up in the stratosphere. This development is often connected to harsh wintry conditions in the UK, as it can cause the jet stream to meander off its normal course. A SSW in February 2018 was responsible for the 'Beast from the East', a winter storm which saw as much as 22 inches of snow fall in some areas and an estimated £1.2 billion in damage caused to the national economy According to the latest Met Office blog, there is a 80% chance that we will see another SSW towards the end of this month, although it is far from certain whether this will have the kind of knock-on effect which causes extreme weather. The forecaster wrote: ""A major SSW often makes the jet stream meander more, which can lead to a large area of blocking high pressure over northern Europe, including the UK.   ""This blocking high pressure can lead to cold, dry weather in the north of Europe, including the UK, with mild, wet and windy conditions more likely for southern areas of the continent. ""However, this is not always the case and impacts on UK weather can also be benign when an SSW occurs."" Prof Adam Scaife, Head of Long-Range Forecasting at the Met Office, said that ""any effect on UK weather"" is most likely to occur in late February and March. In the meantime, freezing fog and frosty conditions are expected to cause disruption on Wednesday. Motorists have been advised to take precautions during the rush hour as visibility could be reduced to as little as 50 metres in some areas. A yellow Met Office weather warning is in place for southern England and East Anglia from 3am until 11am on Wednesday morning. London is among the areas expected to be affected, with Bristol, Norwich and Exeter also included in the warning zone.  UK weather forecast: Frost and fog in the south. Unsettled in the northwest. Wednesday: Frost and fog for the south, soon clearing. Severe gales will accompany a band of squally rain southeast across Scotland, though both easing into early afternoon. Wintry showers follow. Outlook for Thursday to Saturday: Blustery showers in the far north on Thursday, then further mostly light rain at times here on Friday and Saturday. Mostly dry elsewhere, with some sunny spells and becoming milder. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uk-weather-major-incoming-weather-29160380
Joe Biden heckled during fiery State of the Union speech before hitting back at critics,"Republicans heckled US president Joe Biden's State of the Union address in Congress, with some claiming he's a ""liar"". Some conservatives jumped up to the feet throughout the address, tooTension and disarray set the climate during US president Joe Biden's State of the Union address in Congress on Tuesday, with Republicans heckling him when he accused them of wanting to ""sunset Medicare and Social Security"". Though he pledged bipartisanship where possible, Biden underscored the sharp tensions that exist. “Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans — some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset. I am not saying it’s a majority,” Biden said. As GOP lawmakers in the audience pushed back, Biden responded: “We’re not going to be moved into being threatened to default on the debt if we don’t respond.” Some Republicans refused to back down, with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and others jumping to their feet, some yelling “Liar!”   The president answered back, “Stand up and show them: We will not cut Social Security! We will not cut Medicare!” As Republicans continued to protest his accusations, he said: “We’ve got unanimity."" In a 73-minute speech, Biden aimed at reassuring a country beset by pessimism and fraught political divisions and exhorted Congress to unite the nation. He discussed GOP efforts to repeal the Democrats' 2022 climate change and healthcare law and their reluctance to increase the federal debt limit, the nation’s legal borrowing authority that must be raised later this year or risk default.  Biden, not known for his lofty oratory, appeared relaxed and confident as he delivered his address. He casually adlibbed jokes and rejoinders, seeming to feed off the responses from Democratic lawmakers who frequently stood with thunderous ovations and playfully engaging with Republican critics. Addressing Republicans who voted against the big bipartisan infrastructure law, Biden said he'd still ensure their pet projects received federal support. “I promised to be the president for all Americans,"" he said. ""We’ll fund these projects. And I’ll see you at the ground-breaking.”   The heckling — some drawing hushes from New Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy — reflected the newly empowered GOP that is itching to undo many of Biden's achievements and vowing to pursue a multitude of investigations — including looking into the recent discoveries of classified documents from his time as vice president at his home and former office. While hopes for large-scale bipartisanship are slim, Biden reissued his 2022 appeal for Congress to get behind his “unity agenda” of actions to address the opioid epidemic, mental health, veterans’ health and cancer.  In fiery refrains, Biden said the phrase “finish the job” 13 times, challenging lawmakers to complete the work of his administration on capping insulin costs for all Americans, confronting climate change, raising taxes on the wealthy and corporations, and banning assault-style weapons. But on all of those fronts, the divided government is even less likely to yield than the Congress under sole Democratic control. The speech came days after Biden ordered the military to shoot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that flew brazenly across the country, captivating the nation and serving as a reminder of tense relations between the two global powers. “Make no mistake: As we made clear last week, if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country,” Biden said. “And we did.”  Last year’s address occurred just days after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine and many in the West doubted Kyiv’s ability to withstand the onslaught.  Over the past year, the U.S. and other allies have sent tens of billions of dollars in military and economic assistance to bolster Ukraine’s defences. Now, Biden must make the case — both at home and abroad — for sustaining that coalition as the war drags on. “Together, we did what America always does at our best,” Biden said. “We led. We united NATO. We built a global coalition. We stood against Putin’s aggression. We stood with the Ukrainian people.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/joe-biden-heckled-during-state-29160640
Prince Harry and Meghan will be grilled in Samantha Markle lawsuit after Oprah interview,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be questioned after Samantha Markle filed a lawsuit for defamation over 'malicious' claims the duo made in their Oprah interviewThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be questioned over their infamous Oprah interview after being sued for defamation by Samantha Markle. Meghan's half-sister has filed a lawsuit against the couple following the tell-all interview in March 2021. A motion brought to block their testimonies has been refused by a judge, meaning both will have to publicly give evidence. Samantha Markle, whose father is Meghan's estranged dad, Thomas Markle, claims the Duchess made ""demonstrably false and malicious statements"" in the interview. Meghan previously filed a motion to stop depositions in the case from taking place, but this was dismissed by Florida judge Charlene Edwards Honeywell on Tuesday.   ""Defendant Markle does not show that unusual circumstances justify the requested stay, or that prejudice or an undue burden will result if the court does not impose a stay,"" the documents, obtained by the PA news agency, stated. ""Defendant Markle does not satisfy the high standard required to stay discovery pending the resolution of a dispositive motion."" In their joint interview with US talk show host Oprah Winfrey in March 2021, Harry and Meghan spoke about both their families and made a series of allegations about the Royal Family.  Samantha Markle's original complaint, also obtained by PA, stated the comments made by the Sussexes during the interview had reached ""roughly 50 million people in 17 countries"". In the filing she alleged she was defamed by Meghan in the interview when the duchess ""falsely and maliciously"" said that she was ""an only child"".  ""Plaintiff - who suffers from multiple sclerosis and is confined to a wheelchair - brings this action for defamation based on demonstrably false and malicious statements made by her half-sister to a worldwide audience, including roughly 50 million people in 17 countries who watched the Oprah Winfrey interview with the Defendant, Meghan Markle, and her husband, Prince Harry of England,"" the filing stated.  ""Meghan - who was featured with Prince Harry on the cover of Time Magazine's annual feature on 'The World's Most Influential People' published and disseminated false and malicious lies designed to destroy Plaintiff's reputation and which have subjected Plaintiff to humiliation, shame and hatred on a worldwide scale.""  The filing also added that Meghan had used ""the powerful resources of the royal family's public relations operation"" to disseminate and spread ""lies worldwide"" about Samantha Markle and their father, Thomas Markle. ""Defendant orchestrated the campaign to defame and destroy her sister's and her father's reputation and credibility in order to preserve and promote the false 'rags-to-royalty' narrative,"" the filing stated. ""(It was) a premeditated campaign to destroy their reputation and credibility so they could not interfere with or contradict the false narrative and fairy tale life story concocted by the Defendant.""  The planned depositions come following the Sussexes' explosive Netflix series and the publication of Harry's memoir last month.

"Girl, 10, among five arrested after teen filmed 'being beaten up' outside school","A schoolgirl was 'attacked so savagely outside Thomas Knyvett school in Ashford, Surrey, that her hair was pulled out and was seen scattered down the road' as a police investigation begins Police have launched a hunt for a teenager after shocking footage of a schoolgirl appearing to be being viciously assaulted was shared as a 'callous woman egged on the attackers'. The horrific clip, filmed in Ashford, Surrey, was taken on Monday afternoon.  The attack was reportedly so severe that the 15-year-old victim's hair was apparently pulled out and seen scattered down the road.  A 39-year-old woman and a 43-year-old man have been arrested in connection with the incident. Police confirmed that three girls aged 16, 11 and 10 have also been arrested. The force say they are also trying to track down another girl, aged 15.  The footage was taken outside Thomas Knyvett school in the town, two miles from Heathrow Airport. A Surrey Police statement read: ""An investigation is underway after a teenager was injured following a violent altercation in Ashford on Monday, 6 February. ""Police were called following reports of a fight between a group of girls on the junction of Salcombe Road and Stanwell Road at around 2.30pm.

Tory email hints at date for next general election after Rishi Sunak's surprise reshuffle,"An email aimed at introducing new Conservative Party chairman Greg Hands - who will take charge of the Tory election campaign - appears to have revealed when we'll be going to the pollsThe Tories appear to have inadvertently revealed when they plan to hold a General Election. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak carried out a mini reshuffle of his Cabinet, including appointing Greg Hands as Conservative Party chairman to replace sacked Tory Nadhim Zahawi. An email to supporters from the former Trade Minister aimed at introducing himself ahead of the campaign hinted at how long it will be before the country goes to the polls. In Mr Hands' message, sent out from Tory HQ, he said: ""The next 18 months will see us win or lose the next general election.""  It means that Mr Sunak plans to call an election in late summer or early autumn next year - almost as late as he can hold it.   The deadline for the poll is January 2025 but elections over the festive period are rare. However, the 2019 election was held on December 12 and resulted in then-PM Boris Johnson boasting a landslide majority. 18 months would see the election in August, which is again extremely rare, as parliament is usually in recess around then. Instead, the email strongly hints that party activists will spend next summer canvassing in a bid to keep Mr Sunak in Downing Street, reports the Express.  Mr Hands today LBC he ""can't see circumstances where an election would be this year"" and a January 2025 poll would ""not be very festive"" as it would involve a Christmas campaign.  The ""strong expectation would be 2024"", he added. The former Chancellor moved into Number 10 in October last year, replacing Liz Truss. In his email, Mr Hands urged a reluctant general public to join the Tories, saying: ""The deciding factor will be people like you."" He went on: ""I’ll be spending the next few days getting to grips with the party machinery. ""We need it in fighting condition and we need your help to get it there.   ""We need to hit the ground running to keep Keir Starmer out of Downing Street.  ""From helping us secure elections across the nation to delivering on the policies that matter, our members fuel everything we do."" Mr Hands is MP for Chelsea and Fulham, a traditionally blue wall seat, but which is under threat from Labour. He will be joined in the campaign team by new deputy chairman Lee Anderson, a former miner, trade unionist and Labour councillor before switching to the Tories.   Mr Anderson said he was ""feeling very proud"" of his promotion and also pointed to a September election in a recorded message to supporters on Twitter.  He vowed: ""I am going to take this new role really seriously, grafting seven days a week, 12 hours a day for the next 18 months up until the general election.""

Revealing how he felt during meetings with Mr Raab, the ex-staffer told BBC Newsnight: “I found his behaviour offensive and there were times when, despite being an experienced official, I struggled to present the evidence and advice as effectively as I would have liked. “His behaviour was nasty and difficult, using demeaning tactics to make himself the most powerful person in the room. “I saw him seething at other senior people, hard staring at you like cold fury - it was pretty sinister, and raising his voice.”   The ex-official claimed there was “no doubt” Mr Raab’s conduct amounted to “bullying”, saying: “This was somebody who didn’t make you feel safe in the room - not physical, just intimidating. “He would cut people short, telling them to stop talking. “If he didn’t like what someone was saying he would tell them to stop, then turn to another person and say, ‘I don’t understand a word of what X is saying, can you explain this?’”  The accuser admitted he did not “recall swearing” by Mr Raab, telling the BBC: “It was never physical; lots of it was what I would describe as micro-aggressions.  “He would effectively belittle the very senior, very experienced and pretty robust people as a power play rather than for any good reason.”  He added that when Mr Raab was replaced as Justice Secretary over the summer by Brandon Lewis, “people talked about getting over post-traumatic stress disorder”.  “People felt able to do their work properly after he left,” added the source.  Mr Raab was reappointed to the MoJ after just 49 days when Rishi Sunak replaced Liz Truss as Prime Minister.  Mr Raab has denied all claims of bullying. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""There is zero tolerance for bullying across the civil service. ""The Deputy Prime Minister leads a professional department, driving forward major reforms, where civil servants are valued and the level of ambition is high. ""There is an independent investigation under way and it would be inappropriate to comment further on issues relating to it until it is completed.""

British Turkey earthquake survivor shares frantic escape and horror of those 'left behind',"Timothy Whiting, from Yorkshire, has lived in the wider region for the past eight years and was visiting Antakya, in Turkey's south, when the twin earthquakes hitA British software developer who survived the earthquake in Turkey has told The Mirror of his horror hearing people buried alive under the concrete.  Timothy Whiting, 29, has lived in the wider region for the past eight years and was visiting Antakya, in the country's south, when twin earthquakes — the first a magnitude 7.8 and the second a 7.5 — hit Turkey and neighbouring Syria.  Entire city blocks were flattened in the city which borders Syria, and as the total death toll has now passed 8,000, the chances of finding survivors are slimming. The old town in the provincial capital of Hatay was known for its winding cobbled streets, but now, Mr Whiting said, streets are blanketed with concrete, glass and twisted metal. Minarets of mosques have toppled to the floor.  Residents were crushed as they slept before dawn on Monday and the Yorkshire man speaks with anger and confusion at the lack of help from authorities ""I was in the city for 10 hours and there were no visible search and rescue efforts underway. People were just grabbing the debris from buildings to try and smash up the fallen buildings"", he told The Mirror, occasionally pausing when he thinks he feels tremors. ""I keep thinking I can feel it again."" Mr Whiting has experienced a few ""minor"" earthquakes in Turkey before, but nothing on this scale.  Footage showed the room of his hotel obliterated and covered in a film of dust. He said the best way to describe the sound which first woke him up was ""like that first big splash when you jump in a pool."" He makes a ""boom"" sound and waves his arms in the arm.  The former Oxford University student said: ""It was like a whole war had happened in a matter of seconds or minutes.  ""I was trying and get out the door and there was just noise everywhere. I couldn't really see anything but I was just very aware of lots of stuff going on around me. ""We came out of the building and it was just a completely different world from the one we'd gone into before."" Whole families were running through the street screaming in their ""pink pyjamas"", holding lights to try and navigate the rubble which was spilling from all corners. ""When I close my eyes to try and sleep, that one family in their pyjamas is what keeps replaying"", he said with closed eyes.   As dawn broke, people were using whatever they could get their hands on to reach those buried. But with little more than hope, their make-shift tools barely made an impact. ""People were picking up bits of the wrought iron that had fallen down to hit the concrete. It was just absolutely hopeless. There was no one in uniform and I just couldn't believe it. ""Multi-storey blocks were flattened and that was really distressing because you just knew every single block had tonnes of people under,"" he said. Hatay's Mayor is from the major opposition party, stoking fears this is why residents have been left to firefight the situation alone. Mr Whiting was ""keen to stress"", the area is very densely packed and inhabited by lots of Syrian refugees that ""very much feel left behind by Turkey.""  Noises were everywhere: ""There was one woman that was making the loudest sound, which is the sound that people do at weddings and funerals in the Middle East."" Another was running barefoot through the street screaming: ""Get there, my family's gone, they're gone."" He felt all he could do was keep saying in Turkish: ""They're coming, they're coming"". But they did not come. More crews apparently began turning up by Tuesday, but reports said most of the people the rescuers pulled from the rubble were already dead. Pictures from Antakya showed bodies lying on gurneys, or lining the streets in body bags and brightly coloured blankets.  Any government would struggle to deal with a disaster of this scale, but the region is uniquely ill-equipped to cope and the heartache and grief are only going to grow. Mr Whiting was keen to explain the guilt he feels at his luck: ""These people [locals] have it 10 times worse. I keep feeling physically sick all day, at times I actually thought I was going to be sick. All the sounds keep coming back to me. ""I don't want people to think 'this poor this guy, that's ended up in holiday hell.' The knowledge that there are so many people that are alive, still trapped, that are going to be dead and aren't going to be saved. You just can't imagine what they're going through."" President Erdogan of Turkey said that 13 million people had been affected in the country and he declared a three-month state of emergency in 10 provinces.

Ex-detective warns Nicola Bulley mystery may never be solved after 'golden hour',"Former detective superintendent Howard Millington says police would have worked quickly during the Nicola Bulley case's 'golden hour' to rule out third-party involvementA retired detective said Nicola Bulley may never be found if she has drowned in the River Wyre, as police fear. Former detective superintendent Howard Millington said third-party involvement was highly unlikely, but admitted the case was ""very bizarre"", though is ""probably going to end in a tragic outcome"". Lancashire Police yesterday announced the search had been extended up to the sea after scouring the river has so far proved fruitless. Superintendent Sally Riley said detectives ruled out any foul play, but admitted no significant evidence has been found. The 45-year-old vanished on a dog walk in St Michaels on Wyre on January 27, with her phone found on a bench overlooking the water.   A major search effort has been launched, which includes drafting in independent underwater forensic experts Specialist Group International this week. Mr Millington said the police would have moved quickly during the case’s ‘golden hour’ to exhaust the majority of hypotheses - and if she was potentially snatched or attacked investigators would have said by now.  He told the Mirror: “Witnesses haven’t heard any screams or seen any disturbance.  “No clothing has been found, along with the open nature of the area and the fact that it’s popular with dog walkers and this was nine o’clock in the morning, it’s light...  ""All those things taken together lead to the most likely hypothesis being that she’s slipped and fell for whatever reason into the water.” Referring to complaints that the bench where Nicola’s phone was found wasn’t cordoned off initially, he said this would only need to be done if there was cause to believe a criminal act had taken place. “They’ll have done a meticulous search, there’s science behind it, it’s not just random,” Mr Millington - who worked for Greater Manchester Police for 30 years - explained.  “If it was treated as a missing person inquiry, there’s no suggestion of foul play. You would be more focused on searching for the person than preserving evidence of a crime that probably hasn’t happened,” he continued. He said if a third party was involved then there would be specific tell-tale signs - including blood staining or reports of suspicious people in the area by now. “I am almost certain there has been nothing flagged up to the police,” he said.  “Most people, if she had been murdered or abducted, most people in this country, it’s by somebody that’s known to them.”  Mr Millington said her family and friends would have been quickly spoken to and alibis confirmed to rule them out. “If there was something worrying them, [police] would have gathered a vast amount of information so far.   “Then they would be saying they are keeping an open mind and including that it could be suspicious and they are not saying that.” He added: “There’s no way they would be misleading the public, especially if there was a real concern around community safety.” However, he said if significant new evidence suddenly came forward, then investigators would be able to change tact.  Asked how long the police would keep searching for a body, he said: “They can’t search forever.  ""There’s not a lot else they can do. “If she’s ended up in the estuary or the sea, it could take a while. It could even be never. I hope it isn’t but it’s possible.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ex-detective-warns-nicola-bulley-29156144
Epsom College head's sister 'rushed to scene after distressed call' before 'murder-suicide',"Emma Pattison is reported to have made a frantic call to her sister shortly before she and her daughter Lettie were killed in an apparent murder suicide at their home on Epsom College's school groundsThe headteacher of Epsom College reportedly made a frantic call to her sister before she and her daughter were killed in an alleged murder-suicide. Emma Pattison and her seven-year-old daughter Lettie died in the early hours of Sunday morning at their home on the school's grounds. It's been claimed that husband George, 39, shot and killed them before turning the gun on himself. Moments before the unspeakable tragedy, Emma, 45, is reported to have phoned her sister Deborah Kirk. Surrey Police confirmed they were called by Emma's husband in the days before the shootings, and has subsequently referred itself to police watchdog IOPC as a matter of protocol.   Emma and her family moved into their home on Epsom's school grounds back in September when she became the college's first female headteacher. It's now understood that Emma's sister rushed to the scene after the distress call, Mail Online reports.. Neighbours at the couple's former home in nearby Caterham, Surrey, told reporters Emma's car had not been seen since then, although George's BMW, however, had been seen parked on the drive in the run-up to Christmas, suggesting he moved out later. One neighbour said: ""Emma was really nice and charming. She would talk over the fence. George was much quieter, much more introverted."" The new owners of their former home moved in three weeks before the shooting, with a removal van seen picking up their last pieces of furniture shortly beforehand.  In a since-deleted student podcast, Ms Pattison spoke of how recent months in her new role had seen big changes for her family. ""In terms of transition it’s been a really big change for my family. We’ve moved house - we’ve bought a dog. ""I’ve got a new job, my husband has got a new job, that wasn’t meant to happen but it did and my daughter has started a new school so there’s been a lot of change for us as a family.” The head said she ""hadn't looked back"" since entering into teaching and told the student-presented podcast ""working with you people keeps you young, they keep you energised"". ""I am absolutely loving my time here so far,"" Mrs Pattison added. ""It's been very busy but absolutely wonderful. The college have been so supportive and everyone has been very, very welcoming.""  Detective Chief Inspector Kimball Edey, senior investigating officer on the case, said: “This is an incredibly traumatic incident and we are working around the clock to investigate and understand the exact circumstances which led to this point. “We understand the public concern and upset, and we will clarify what we can, when we can, while respecting the right to a level of privacy for the families of those who have lost their lives. “We are cooperating fully with the IOPC in relation to the referral we have made, and we await the outcome of its assessment of what further action may be required. Until this has been completed, we will be unable to provide further details on a number of matters.” In a statement, the school said: ""It is with the deepest sadness and regret that we have to announce the news of the deaths of Emma Pattison, Head of Epsom College, her daughter Lettie, and her husband George. ""Our thoughts, condolences and sympathies are with their families at this tragic time."" ""The College is working with the police in what remains an ongoing investigation. ""We must now focus on the welfare and wellbeing of our pupils and staff, and work to ensure that they receive all the comfort, warmth and support required from the Epsom College community.""

Nicola Bulley police warn vigilantes to stop breaking into homes to hunt for missing mum,"Lancashire Constabulary said it ""will not tolerate"" members of the public committing criminal offences to try and find mum-of-two Nicola Bulley, who went missing on January 27Police searching for missing dog walker Nicola Bulley have warned vigilante members of the public not to ""take the law into their own hands"" by breaking into empty or derelict riverside properties. The disappearance of the mum-of-two has seen a massive investigation centred on the River Wyre in Lancashire. A team of 40 detectives are working on approximately 500 different lines of inquiry, Superintendent Sally Riley said. More than 700 drivers who travelled through the village around the time the 45-year-old went missing are being traced. In a press conference yesterday, Lancashire Constabulary said it ""will not tolerate"" members of the public committing criminal offences to try and find Ms Bulley.  The force also warned not to direct online abuse at people connected to the investigation.   Superintendent Sally Riley said: ""We will not tolerate online abuse of anyone, including innocent witnesses, members of the family and friends, of local businesses, or of criminal damage or burglary. We will be taking a strong line on that, as you would expect."" Ms Riley told reporters: ""There are some properties along the riverside which are empty or derelict. ""Whilst it may be well intentioned that people think that that could be a line of inquiry, I would ask them to desist from doing that. ""In some cases it may be criminal if they are breaking in and causing damage or committing a burglary.""  She said officers have searched derelict riverside properties with the permission of owners. ""Because there is no criminal element yet identified, and we don't expect there to be in this inquiry, then we're not starting to go into houses because that's not where the inquiry is leading us,"" she added. Ms Riley also urged the public to avoid ""distressing"" speculation about what might have happened to Ms Bulley. ""We would ask that people in the wider community, particularly on social media and online, do not speculate as to what may have happened to Nicola,"" she told reporters at the press conference.  ""This is particularly hurtful to her family, to her children, to her partner Paul, to her parents, her sister and her friends because it is not helpful to them, it is distressing and it is distracting for the police inquiry. ""Nor is it helpful if people, particularly if they have come from outside of the area, take it upon themselves to take the law into their own hands by trying to, for example, break into empty property. ""They may mean well, they may want to help. But they can help in thinking back if they were in the area to what information they may have of relevance to the police and holding the family in their thoughts."" Peter Faulding, leader of underwater search experts Specialist Group International (SGI), has been searching the river for two days after being called in by the family to help.  Mr Faulding has said if his team does not find her in the water using his sonar equipment then he believes she has not been in the river and raised ""third party"" involvement in the disappearance. But Ms Riley told reporters at a press conference in the village that Mr Faulding is not included in ""all the investigation detail"". She added: ""Our search has not found Nicola in the river and then a re-search in parts by SGI has found the same. That does not mean... that Nicola has not been in the river. ""In the light of other inquiries being discounted from the investigation so far... clearly our main belief is that Nicola did fall into the river. ""Clearly Mr Faulding isn't included within all the investigation detail any more than the members of the public are that I'm briefing through these sorts of press conferences.""

'How do I tell my kids I'm dying of cancer?' - single mum shares heartbreaking dilemma,"Louise Hayward, 48, from Whitchurch, Bristol, has been told she is dying of bowel cancer and she is worried about the future for her children, feeling the diagnosis has been ""unfair"" on themA single mum has told how she is struggling to tell her youngest children she is dying of cancer and feels it is ""unfair"" on them that she won't be there to look after them.  Louise Hayward, 48, from Whitchurch, Bristol, was diagnosed with bowel cancer in November 2020 - and it quickly spread to her liver and lungs. And after two gruelling years of chemotherapy she was told last November that doctors had run out of options. Now with less than a year to live she is frantically raising cash to support her two youngest kids - who will be raised by her sister when she dies. So far she has not told her two youngest children about the devastating prognosis.   While she has told William, 19, about her situation, Faith, nine and Louie, seven, know she has cancer but not that it is terminal. So far Louise has received more than £8,000 in donations for her kids. She said: ""All of this is so scary - I was never expecting to be told I was dying. In November 2022, they told me there is nothing else they can do - I was devastated. ""I begged them to give me more chemotherapy - which they did - but it's hard to accept I am going to die soon. It's so unfair on my kids - they know about my cancer but I haven't been able to tell them I'm dying. ""It's so unfair on them - I just think, why did they have to be born into this life? How do I tell them they're going to lose their mum at such a young age? ""Any money I can save up for them before I pass will make it easier for them when I do."" Louise was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer after noticing blood when she went to the loo in November 2020.  She recalled putting off visiting her doctor due to the pandemic - but it became so bad that she had no choice. She recalled one day having such a severe bleed after going to the toilet that all she could do was ""sit on a towel to stop the bleeding"". She said: ""I felt like I was giving birth, that's how bad the pain was."" Doctors diagnosed her quickly after finding a seven centimetre tumour in her bowel. She began chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but after two years, the single stay-at-home mum was told the cancer had spread. In November, 2022, she was told it had spread to her liver and lungs, and had begun to affect her kidneys too. She wants to raise as much money to support her youngest children as she can, before she tells them.  Louise said: ""I watched Deborah James deteriorate - she was on the same meds that I am on. I watched her deteriorate, and thought soon that's going to be me.""   Louise's sister, Rachel, 47, whose children are grown up, will eventually move into Louise's house to parent little Faith and Louie. She doesn't even plan to have a funeral to limit her children's future pain. ""I don't want to put my children through it twice - you lose somebody, then you live it all over again at the funeral,"" said Louise. She fears how they will cope as she has ""done everything"" for her children as a single parent. ""My little one, Louie, especially relies on me,"" said Louise. ""Faith and Louie know about the cancer, the chemo, and the pain I'm in - but only William knows I am dying. ""These past two years, even with cancer I have continued to look after them on my own. I did the housework, cooked, took them to school, on my own - looking at me even now, you'd never believe I was ill. ""It's so hard to accept that in reality, I am going to die soon."" She added: ""It's just so unfair on my kids. I wonder why they had to be born into this life. How can I tell them they're going to lose their mum at such a young age? ""All I can do is try to raise some money for them after I have passed."" People can donate to Louise's fundraiser here. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/how-tell-kids-im-dying-29161316
Diver searching for missing mum Nicola Bulley says 'she didn't fall in river',"Nicola Bulley did not fall in the water, accoding to Peter Faulding, who runs search group Specialist Group International. The company carried out a sonar sweep this week.A dive search specialist with years of experience says missing mum-of-two Nicola Bulley is not in the river - as she would have been located by police divers by now. Peter Faulding, who has dealt with similar missing person hunts, said: ""I don’t think she fell in the water."" He told breakfast show host Nick Ferrari on LBC: ""That's just my opinion with all the drownings I've dealt with over the years. ""They normally go down and the police dive team are brilliant, they know what they're doing, professional, they would have found her, as we would've done. ""We locate people quickly. That's what I'm shocked with, that she's disappeared."" Mr Faulding, who runs search group Specialist Group International, arrived to much media fanfare as he carried out a sonar sweep this week. There has been no trace of the missing woman since she vanished while walking her dog by the river in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, on January 27.   Her phone was found on a bench by the waterside and had recently connected to a work call. Her dog Willow was running loose. Police launched an extensive search of the area and said their ""main working hypothesis"" was that she fell in a river but a body has never been found. Ms Bulley had dropped her two daughters, aged six and nine, off at school and then gone on her usual dog walk alongside the river before she disappeared.  Mr Faulding told TalkTV yesterday: ""After 25 years of doing this kind of work, after hundreds of cases, I am well and truly baffled.  ""Normally you would expect the divers to find them easily. The police have nothing to go on. ""All they have is a mobile phone at the moment and they said it could possibly be a decoy.""   Mr Faulding said that police had searched the immediate area of the bench on two occasions, and his teams are planning to search there again yesterday.  At the time he said police divers have already thoroughly searched that stretch of the river and wouldn't have missed anything. However, specialist equipment used by his team could help to ""completely rule out anything"". Speaking on ITV's Good Morning Britain, he said: ""I personally think, if I rule this stretch of river out today where we are working, I don't think she is here and there is probably a third party involved.""

Nicola Bulley's pal says 'nothing makes sense' as walk route becomes 'tourist attraction',"Nicola Bulley's friend Heather Gibbons said no-one would know what happened ""until we have some evidence"".

Speaking on the riverbank, Ms Gibbons said speculation on social media about the disappearance had been ""hard"" for the family to deal with.  She added that the number of visitors arriving in the area had made it feel like a ""tourist spot"". She told reporters: ""Up to a certain level, we understand it's human nature, it's natural for everyone to have speculation, because the truth is in this, nothing is making sense.""   She added that while the ""turnout for the search"" had been ""amazing... we have noticed it does feel like some people have come to maybe use it as more like a tourist spot"". ""The truth is if we look at it factually, no-one knows [what has happened] until we have some evidence. ""I know that the family are massively appreciative of all the police have done [and] we feel we have got the best of the best on that water.

Missing Nicola Bulley: All the facts about disappearance - and mysteries that remain,"The search for Nicola Bulley has reached its 13th day and police admit there is little evidence to go on, though continue to hypothesise she fell into the River WyreMissing mum Nicola Bulley vanished on a dog walk along a remote riverbank 13 days ago.  Despite a major search effort, police admitted yesterday no significant evidence has been found to prove what actually happened.  The 45-year-old had dropped her two children off at school in St Michaels on Wyre on January 27 before taking springer spaniel Willow along a river towpath. However, her phone was later found on a bench overlooking the water, with the dog wandering alone nearby.  A major police operation has been launched, with an independent under forensics team also drafted in this week. Police have ruled out third party involvement and yesterday extended the search to the sea - but there are still no concrete clues about what happened to her.  Below is a rundown of the facts and the key questions that still need answering...    Nicola's last known movements  As part of the public appeal, police released a timeline of Nicola's movements during her walk. At 8.26am on Friday, January 27, Nicola left her home in Inskip with her two daughters, aged six and nine, dropping them off at school and engaging in a brief conversation with another parent around 15 minutes later. Doorbell camera footage was released showing her outside the family home loading the dog into the boot.   Leaving her car park at the school, she took Willow for a walk at 8.43am along the river path. She was seen by a dog walker who knew her at around 8.50am and at 8.53am sent an email to her boss. It's understood she then texted her friend about meeting up later in the week at 8.57am and then logged into a work conference call at 9.01am. She was seen by a second witness at 9.10am, the last known sighting. Phone and dog found - but no sign of Nicola  Despite her last known sighting being in a field, Nicola's phone was found back down the route on a bench at 9.33am. Another dog walker came through a gate and found Willow wandering alone without her harness on, which was on the floor - then spotted the phone. Willow is described as being agitated, but friends said it was common for Nicola to remove her harness to let her roam around while she waited nearby.  It is understood the unnamed dog walker was able to get a message to Nicola's partner Paul and he headed to the scene before reporting her missing to the police. This was done around 10.50am. Underwater forensics specialist Peter Faulding - who is involved in the scouring the river - has suggested the phone may have been placed on the bench as a decoy. Search launched  A major search effort was launched that morning, with Bowland Pennine Mountain Rescue drafted in around midday. Led by Kev Camplin, a team of 25 trained search volunteers, joined police specialists until it got dark. Their efforts included searching the grounds of a large country home, which they initially presumed was empty.  However, someone identifying themselves as the property owner agreed to search inside but didn't find Nicola. The following day, police drones, helicopters and dogs, as well as fire and rescue services and an underwater search team were at the scene. And on the Sunday (January 29), residents met at the village hall around 10.30am before organising two separate searches in the morning and afternoon. Police warned volunteers to be cautious, describing the river and its banks as ""extremely dangerous"" and saying that activity in these areas pose ""a genuine risk to the public"". Police speak to witnesses  In the first press conference on Monday, January 30, Superintendent Sally Riley said her colleagues were ""keeping a really open mind about what could have happened"", and that they're not treating Nicola's disappearance as suspicious. Investigators released the CCTV image of a potential witness - a man in his 70s - the following day and he was spoken to. Days later a second witness was sought - 68-year-old Christine Bowman - who was then tracked down but said she was baffled as she'd already given officers a statement. A third witness, a woman pushing a baby in a pram, was also sought. Family speaks out  Nicola's parents, Ernest and Dot Bulley, spoke to The Mirror on February 1 about the ""horror"" they faced over the possibility of never seeing her again. Her father said: ""We just dread to think we will never see her again, if the worst came to the worst and she was never found, how will we deal with that for the rest of our lives."" They were then joined the following day on TV by daughter Louise Cunningham.  Two days later Nicola's partner Paul spoke in a separate televised interview. Police hypothesis  On Friday, Superintendent Riley said the main hypothesis was that Nicola had fallen into the river. She warned the public against speculation, saying it's ""possible"" that an ""issue"" with Nicola's dog may have led her to the water's edge, such as dropping a ball in the water. Nicola's friends rubbished this claim, saying they rarely took the ball on walks and she wouldn't have tried to fish it out, putting herself at risk. Police have also made clear there is no evidence supporting their main theory, including any slip marks at the scene. Nicola is also described as a strong swimmer and despite a pool in the middle of the section of river going down 18ft, there was not thought to have been a strong current at the time. Supt Riley reiterated this line of thinking yesterday and ruled out foul play. She added that the search has been extended to the estuary and sea at Morecambe. Dive expert's theory  Specialist Group International (SGI) were drafted in on Monday and have spent two days searching the river using special sonar equipment. Dive chief Peter Faulding initially said his team would find Nicola in under an hour if she had fallen into the river at the bench. He speculated if she had drowned her body would have become snagged and would have got stuck within 500 metres. Mr Faulding was adamant she wouldn't have drifted out to sea.

The annual survey saw 105,598 readers vote for the worst places/towns to live in England, with some locals also offering an insight on what it's really like to live there. This year the poll, compiled by iLivehere, found a new 'winner' as Luton managed to rise in unpopularity from No. 3 to take the crown as England's 'worst place'. Giving their thoughts on the Bedfordshire town, one local described it as ""not easy on the eye"", while another said it made ""Slough comparable to the 'Playboy tax haven of Monaco'."" Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, which was named the worst place to live in 2022, slid down several spots to number five, while Huddersfield, which last year took second place, was curiously left off the list.   Reading was ranked on the list twice - in 21st place as well as in 12th place - either as a mistake or as a mark of its unpopularity. Coming in second place was Peterborough, followed by Portsmouth, then Slough in fourth place ahead of Aylesbury.  One voter commented that ""Portsmouth was an island and I bet people are wondering why they connected it to the mainland and didn't just let it drift away"".  Thanks to the narrow Portsea Creek separating Portsmouth from the mainland, the city is in fact the UK's only island city. Moving down past the top five, Aldershot was ranked England's sixth worst place to live. ""From the Burger King carpark sound off to the 'designer' outlet stores, this place really oozes chav from every concrete pore,"" one voter said.  In seventh place was Andover, while Swindon was only slightly more popular - coming in eight place.  Taking out ninth spot was Bournemouth, with one person having commented: ""If you come from anywhere inland, expecting a pleasant, sunny day at the beach, then you're a fool"". Capping off the top ten was Bradford, which someone had described as: ""The land of dreams, if you dream of takeaways and pound shops"". One faithful Lutonian has spoken out in support of the town after the list was published, defending it as a ""vibrant, diverse town"". Linsey Sweet, chair of Love Luton, said the town had ""award winning parks"" and ""fabulous communities"" who supported one another as well as businesses that provided a wide variety of jobs.  ""It has great schools, amazing colleges and an outstanding university, there is plenty to Love about Luton. # ""We would very much welcome the organisers of the poll to come for a visit to see just how great Luton is,"" she added.  The list, from the place voted the 50th 'worst place to live' to the top 'worst place to live', is as follows: 50. Northampton 49. Ipswich 48. Hull 47. Canterbury 46. Jaywick 45. Doncaster  44. Wigan 43. Manchester 42. Stevenage 41. York 40. Hounslow 39. Chatham 38. Harlow 37. Wisbech 36. Boston 35. Milton Keynes  34. Bolton 33. Wolverhampton 32. Poole 31. Abingdon 30. Grimsby 29.

Ukraine's President Zelensky touches down in UK for first visit since war began,"The heroic war leader will hold talks with Rishi Sunak and address MPs in Parliament on his trip to the UK as well as holding an audience with King CharlesUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has travelled to the UK for his first visit since the Russian invasion began nearly a year ago. His plane touched down at Stansted Airport at 10.22am for the surprise trip, where he was met on the tarmac by Rishi Sunak. The heroic war leader travelled to London with the Prime Minister in a motorcade and the pair walked up Downing Street together where a red carpet was laid out. Applause could be heard from staff behind the famous black door as Mr Zelensky arrived, which is highly unusual when a foreign leader visits No10. Mr Zelensky thanked Britain for its ""big support from the first days of full-scale invasion"" as he went inside to hold talks with Mr Sunak after the Prime Minister announced plans to train Ukrainian pilots to allow them to fly sophisticated NATO-standard fighter jets. Mr Zelensky and Mr Sunak will visit Ukrainian troops being trained in Britain later today.   The Ukrainian President will also hold an audience with King Charles and deliver an address to MPs in Parliament. The visit is only Mr Zelensky's second outside Ukraine since the war began after he made a whirlwind trip to the United States in December. Mr Sunak tweeted a picture of himself embracing the Ukrainian leader on his arrival, saying: ""Welcome to the UK, President Zelensky.  ""#SlavaUkraini."" The expansion of the UK's training programme to include jet fighter pilots is a significant move as Ukraine has been urging Western nations to supply planes. The UK has so far refused, arguing that the RAF's F-35 and Typhoon jets take too long for pilots to train on.  But the announcement by No 10 signals a shift for the future, and officials said that ""as part of that long-term capability investment"" the UK will work with Ukraine and international allies ""to co-ordinate collective support to meet Ukraine's defensive needs"". Ukrainian troops are already being trained in the use of Challenger 2 tanks, which are expected to be sent to the country next month. Mr Sunak will offer longer-range firepower to help counter Russia's ability to strike at Ukraine's towns and energy facilities. The Prime Minister said: “President Zelensky’s visit to the UK is a testament to his country’s courage, determination and fight, and a testament to the unbreakable friendship between our two countries.  ""Since 2014, the UK has provided vital training to Ukrainian forces, allowing them to defend their country, protect their sovereignty and fight for their territory.  ""I am proud that today we will expand that training from soldiers to marines and fighter jet pilots, ensuring Ukraine has a military able to defend its interests well into the future.  ""It also underlines our commitment to not just provide military equipment for the short term, but a long-term pledge to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine for years to come."" It comes as Foreign Secretary James Cleverly unveiled a fresh package of sanctions against the Russian military and Kremlin elites.  Six entities providing military equipment such as drones and helicopters to Russia have been slapped with sanctions. The Foreign Office said that the sanctions also targeted five individuals linked to Vladimir Putin's luxury residences, including presidential commissioner for entrepreneur's rights Boris Titov and Aerostart owner Viktor Myachin. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said: ""These new sanctions accelerate the economic pressure on Putin - undermining his war machine to help Ukraine prevail. ""I am determined, consistent with our laws, that Russia will have no access to the assets we have frozen until it ends, once and for all, its threats to Ukraine's territorial sovereignty and integrity."" Mr Sunak travelled to Kyiv in November only weeks after he became Prime Minister. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/breaking-ukraines-president-zelensky-touches-29162679
Mum's anger as 'humiliated' children are 'denied school dinners over parents debt',"A furious mum claimed children at their school were left in tears after having their school dinner taken away from them by canteen staff because of unpaid debtsA mum claims children were left ""humiliated"" after their school dinners were taken away from their plates over debts. The parent, who wished to remain anonymous, said Liverpool College left children without school dinners on Thursday, February 2. Lunch staff reportedly removed slices of pizza, cookies and bottles of water from plates and told children simply ""not today"" in front of other pupils - although the school denied the accusation. The mum claimed staff told the children to inform their parents about their debt, leaving many in tears. The parent said: ""The school wrote to parents last week threatening to take legal action over minimal balances. ""They then decided to humiliate scores of children as their accounts for school meals had slipped into a negative balance.   ""The lunch staff publicly shamed the children by coming through the lunch hall with tongs and removing slices of pizzas, cookies, and bottles of water from their plates. ""I think the word from one of them was 'not today' as they took one of the child's two slices of pizza. ""To add insult to injury, the food then had to be disposed of as the children had touched it. ""Children were left in tears, ringing their parents to have their accounts topped up, but even this wasn’t enough as they were then told it took time to register and sent them away again."" Though the parent's children were not affected, she was shocked to hear of the treatment of their friends. She said she understood schools should not have to deal with the debts, but believed there was a better way to communicate with both the children and parents. She added: ""I cannot believe that any school would treat families like this - particularly one which purports to have such high values. ""There are many families across the city who are struggling with the cost of living. ""Children having to call their parents telling them they need to top up in January must have been really embarrassing."" Principal, Mr Hans van Mourik Broekman, denied the claims that any pupil has or will ever go without lunch at Liverpool College. He said: ""No pupil at Liverpool College has ever - or will ever - go without a lunch. ""The College and its catering company partner do need to limit the amount currently owed by parents to our caterer as it is at unsustainable levels. ""We appreciate times are difficult and we will not see pupils go without a lunch. ""These policies have been explained in writing to parents and pupils, and the College has apologised for any upset caused by their introduction.""

Nicola Bulley's partner visits river with dive expert who fears dog walker was abducted,"Nicola Bulley's partner Paul Ansell has been pictured at the search scene in St Michaels on Wyre today, on what is the 13th day of the search for the missing mum Nicola Bulley's partner has visited the search scene - with the mum-of-two having been missing for 13 days. Paul Ansell has been snapped being briefed by police and dive expert Peter Faulding as he looked out across the River Wyre at the point where investigators believe his long-term girlfriend fell in. The 45-year-old vanished on January 27 after dropping off her two children at school in St Michael's, Lancashire, before taking family dog Willow for a walk on a nearby trail. However, her phone was later found on a bench, with the springer spaniel wandering nearby without her harness. Paul, 44, is understood to have been contacted by another dog walker who came across the scene on the morning of the disappearance. He then rushed to the scene and called the police.   The dad has put out a number of appeals, on TV and through the police in recent days. On Monday, he said he and everyone close to Nicola needs to know what happened to her. He added that Nicola's daughters ""miss their mummy desperately"" and have been going through ""a tough time"" since her disappearance.  Paul has been asked by forensic underwater search chief Mr Faulding whether his missing partner had any ""enemies or stalkers"" amid fears she could have been abducted. Specialist Group International (SGI) were drafted in earlier this week to help the river search with their high tech sonar equipment. Firm founder Mr Faulding told the Mirror his team would find Nicola almost immediately if she fell in the river at the point by the bench.  However, with still no sign of her, he believes she may well have been abducted. He said he called Paul on Monday night to update him on SGI's first day. Mr Faulding said the dad was ""distraught"". Speaking yesterday, he said: ""I spoke to Paul last night and asked him if she had any enemies, any stalkers, the normal questions you would ask.   ""And nothing, he said no. And she was totally normal that day when she left, nothing out the ordinary."" Paul has previously been out as part of volunteer searches, including reportedly searching an abandoned property. A family friend told the Mirror he also attended a meeting on Sunday, January 29 - two days after Nicola's disappearance - at the village hall. Those in attendance then launched two separate search teams.  With no sign of Nicola, Mr Faulding believes more than ever that a third party could be involved. He has admitted the case has baffled him, telling LBC ""she's just disappeared like she's been taken by aliens"". He told Good Morning Britain: ""I personally think if I rule this stretch of river out today where we're working I don't think she's here, I think there's probably a third party involved.""  However, Lancashire Police have ruled out foul play, with Superintendent Sally Riley yesterday playing down Mr Faulding's theories. Asked about Mr Faulding's comments at a press briefing, Supt Riley said: ""I thank SGI for the help they've given to the team. ""Our search has not found Nicola in the river and any re-search done in parts by SGI found the same.  ""That does not mean that Nicola has not been in the river. And in light of other enquiries being discounted from the investigation so far - although we are keeping an open mind to anything new - then clearly our main belief is that Nicola did fall into the river. ""Clearly Mr Faulding isn't included in all the investigation detail anymore than the members of the public are that I'm briefing through these sorts of press conferences. ""We would ask that we be allowed time to continue with those enquiries and release to the public only what is relevant.""

New Look closing stores across UK - see list of branches shutting for good,"New Look will be closing shops across the UK and said it was working to find ""suitable alternative roles"" for the staff affected - see the list of locations belowFashion retailer New Look is shutting up shop at a string of locations across the UK but says the closures are part of its ""normal course of business"".  Three of the site closures were down to the landlord wanting to take the retail space back. Of the sites to be closing, four shut up shop in January and three are closing in February.  The locations of the sites affected include Birmingham, Coventry, Trowbridge, Kirkcaldy, Walthamstow and Northampton. A New Look spokesperson told Birmingham Live: “Regrettably, our New Look store in Coventry's Arena Shopping Park is closing following the landlord's request to take the property back and exit the lease early.

Rapist cop David Carrick faces FOOD TERRORISM after becoming No1 target in jail,"Former Met Police officer David Carrick, a serial rapist, will now be the ""No.1"" target in Belmarsh prison following his sentencing and he faces the prospect of ""food terrorism"", it is claimedRapist Met Police officer David Carrick faces ""food terrorism"" in jail where he could have his food ""messed with"" or ""spat in"", reportedly said a former prisoner. Carrick will serve at least 30 years behind bars for attacking a dozen women over a 17-year period. And a former soldier who spent seven years in prison said Carrick, who is on 24/7 death watch after being sentenced yesterday, will be seen by fellow prisoners as a ""No.1 target"", reports the Daily Star. Richard Jones, who was released in 2019 after completing a sentence for conspiracy to supply cocaine, said the ex cop will now have a ""horrible"" life. “He is going to live a horrible, s***ty life. He will be on VP wings all the time so there’s no way anyone will get to him but people will try,"" he said.  “The only way anyone can get to someone who is in for an offence of that type is if they’re orderlies working on the segregation unit or block and they are serving the food. “It is something we call food terrorism where they literally do things to their food knowing it will go to them. So he will be even mindful of the psychological warfare going on when it comes to ‘is my food been messed with, has this sandwich been spat in, should I eat the custard or not?'. “He will be questioning his own mind when it comes to whether he should eat the food. People on the block will be saying ‘they are spitting in your food mate, they are doing this to your food’ and he will have this in his head with every meal he gets. “What he may do, which some people do, he may change religion and go for Kosher food, which comes packed, a pre-packed meal which comes microwavable, that will be his safest route. “He is in for a long hard sentence.”  Carrick, who was sacked from the force following his conviction, was handed 36 life sentences with a minimum term of 30 years and 239 days. The sex predator previously admitted 49 charges, including 24 counts of rape and charges of sexual assault, controlling and coercive behaviour and false imprisonment. He is being held at a maximum security unit in HMP Belmarsh and there is already a bounty on his head, according to Daily Star jail sources. Former prisoner Mr Jones, from Bristol, now works to support military veterans who have ended up in prison. And asked what 24/7 watch will mean for Carrick, he told the Daily Star: “He will be in a cell where he has a member of staff sat outside viewing him through a barred cell. “It will have a polycarbonate shield so it will be protecting him from any fluids, i.e. blood if he does slash himself up. “But they can see him clearly in the cell and they will sit outside watching him, taking notes of every single movement, he won’t get to do anything alone, he will be escorted everywhere.  “He will be under protection so they won’t be able to get to him but they will want to get to him. Or he could be in a cell with a camera maybe in the top corner with a protected visor or shield watching him that way. “Sometimes if it’s a camera they may be too far away to make a difference if he does try to take his own life. “It may take longer for them to get to him rather than have a member of staff sit right outside the door where they can be in there within seconds to prevent him hurting himself. “He will be literally thoroughly searched on his way in, they will make sure he hasn’t got any blades, if he wants to have a shave he will be watched having a shave to make sure the blades don’t come out the razors and the razors will be issued to him to be used and then taken back so he can’t hold on to anything. “It will be very hard for him to try to take his life because everything he does will be monitored and watched.”",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/rapist-cop-david-carrick-faces-29162825
Epsom headteacher's husband 'reported wife for hitting him' before 'murder-suicide',"Epsom College head Emma Pattison and her daughter Lettie are tragically believed to have been shot and killed by George Pattison before he turned the gun on himselfThe husband of Epsom College headteacher Emma Pattison told police she had 'hit him' years ago before withdrawing the complaint, The Mirror understands. Emma, 45, and her seven-year-old daughter Lettie were killed at their home on the school's grounds in the early hours of Sunday morning after George Pattison is thought to have shot them before turning the gun on himself. The unspeakable tragedy has led to an outpouring of grief and prompted the College to close until after next week's half term. Surrey Police have said the couple were ""not known"" to them, meaning there was no official history of violence.  However, sources say Mr Pattison, 39, had once reported Emma, claiming she had struck him six years ago - though his allegation resulted in no action. The Times reports the couple were spoken to at the time before George withdrew the report, saying it was trivial. The historic allegations have not been confirmed by police.   Mr Pattison, a chartered accountant, had a gun licence which was renewed last year and was spoken to on routine by Surrey Police on Thursday following his recent change of address. The force has confirmed the visit and has subsequently referred itself to independent watchdog IOPC as a matter of protocol, due to the short time between their contact and the deaths. UK law requires licenced firearms holders to notify the Home Office when they change addresses, while police visit holders to make sure weapons are being correctly stored.  Emma and daughter Lettie moved to the home on Epsom College's grounds in September as the headteacher took up her new role, becoming the prestigious school's first ever female head. According to neighbours at the couple's former home in nearby Caterham, Mr Pattison was seen staying on at the old house and is thought to have only joined his family in Epsom in recent weeks. Detective Chief Inspector Kimball Edey, senior investigating officer on the case, said: “This is an incredibly traumatic incident and we are working around the clock to investigate and understand the exact circumstances which led to this point. “We understand the public concern and upset, and we will clarify what we can, when we can, while respecting the right to a level of privacy for the families of those who have lost their lives. “We are cooperating fully with the IOPC in relation to the referral we have made, and we await the outcome of its assessment of what further action may be required. Until this has been completed, we will be unable to provide further details on a number of matters.”  Emma, who had previously told a student podcast she was ""loving"" her time so far in her new role, reportedly made a distressed phone call to her sister shortly before she and Lettie were killed. Ambulances were called to the scene after a neighbour reported hearing gunshots at the house, with all three tragically confirmed dead. Tributes have been paid to Emma and Lettie, with the youngster described by a nursery worker as ""perfect in every way"". Emma, who was previously head at Croydon High School, was described by staff there as a ""much loved and respected"" colleague. Cheryl Giovannoni, from the school, said: ""She touched the lives of all of us with her energy, wisdom and kindness during her six years as head of Croydon High School and the school will always bear the legacy of her inspiring leadership.""

Pigeon dyed pink for gender reveal party dies after being found starving in park,"Flamingo the pigeon was rescued after he was died pink for a gender reveal party in Madison Square Park, New York, US, on January 30 but tragically died from the toxic fumesA pigeon who was found malnourished and dyed pink for a gender reveal party has died, according to officials.  The bird, named Flamingo because of its bright pink colour, was purchased at a poultry market for a gender reveal party in Madison Square Park, New York, US, on January 30. The Wild Bird Fund rescued the bird and took him into their care for treatment after they believed the pigeon was dyed deliberately. However, he tragically died on Tuesday.  The non-for-profit organisation confirmed the bird died after inhaling toxins from the pink dye. Wild Bird Fund said in a statement on Twitter: ""We are deeply sad to report that Flamingo, our sweet pink pigeon, has passed away. “Despite our best efforts to reduce the fumes coming off the dye, while keeping him calm and stable, he died in the night. We believe his death was caused by inhaling the toxins.” The wildlife charity believe the bird was dyed in order for a couple to throw a gender reveal party to announce the sex of their unborn child.   The tradition originally started in the US and has grown in popularity with couples having different ways of announcing the sex of their child.   Some of the gender reveal parties include ballon-popping, which reveals either pink or blue confetti. However, in this instance, a pigeon was dyed pink to reveal the gender of a child. The Wild Bird Fund added: ""Flamingo’s story sparked a lot of emotion and generated interest from around the world.  ""We hope the tale of his too-short life will help prevent more acts of careless cruelty.” The group originally tried to rescue him by bathing him to get ride of the pink dye.  They also used heat, oxygen and subcutaneous fluids, and medication to try and nullify the toxin’s effects on the bird.  However, he was unable to eat and struggled to digest food.  “This king pigeon, a domestic bird likely raised for food, was malnourished, barely older than a baby and had no survival skills,” the group said.  “Dove releases sound romantic, but take away the decorations and Instagram photos, and they are the equivalent of dumping your helpless pets on the side of the road. This is no way to celebrate anything.” The wildlife charity said domestic birds should never be released into the wild as they won't survive. The Wild Bird Fund said in a statement: ""Please never release domestic birds to the wild. ""Not for weddings, funerals, celebrations, art projects, anything. (We'd hope that 'don't dye them' goes without saying, but...) They will starve or be preyed on. ""If you find an all white pigeon (or any odd colour), especially one looking scared and lost, it needs help."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/pigeon-dyed-pink-gender-reveal-29162343
Woman can't recognise brother's face after he's stabbed in horror racist attack,"Police are on the hunt to find racist thugs who attacked a vape shop manager stabbing, punching and kicking him during a vicious unprovoked assaultPolice are on the hunt to find racist thugs who attacked a vape store manager by punching, kicking and stabbing him twice in the leg. The 21-year-old, from Battle, Hastings, who is black, had his shop robbed twice in just 48 hours on both Monday and Tuesday this week. The police have not said that the two incidents are linked.  An investigation is now underway to find two men involved in the stabbing - as the shop owner's devastated sister Lucy says that her brother is now 'unrecognisable.'  Lucy, who works as an anti-knife campaigner, added that her family have been left to ‘clean up blood’ in the shop.  But while the perpetrators are still at large, her younger brother continues to live in fear until they are caught.  Read More
  Lucy explained how the shop had been robbed one one day and the next day her brother was brutally assaulted in an unprovoked attack. Speaking to the Mirror she said: ”I’ve just seen my brother’s face this morning, it’s unrecognisable. My cousin reported this is a race hate crime, the robbery on Sunday night of the shop. “And then my brother goes back to work this morning and as soon as the two boys walked in they punched my brother straight his face, kicking him in the head and stabbing him twice in the leg and ran off. “This can’t be left, imagine if he’d been in a coma or died.” Lucy says that when she received the news, she began 'screaming' and immediately drove to her sibling's aid. She said: “I was screaming. I dropped the phone and I burnt myself. I was cooking. I was screaming and screaming and screaming. I was shaking. My other brother came to collect me and drove me to Battle. “I arrived here to see my brother's got five stitches, his legs still bleeding, his lips swollen and his face is busted open.”   Lucy says she feels the attack was “race related” as it is the only black-owned shop in the town to have been robbed and its owner assaulted. She also added that someone had been in the shop previously mentioned that they had been attacked by a black man before which led them to believe the separate assault and robbery were both racially aggravated. Now Lucy, who says her brother is living in fear, believes that he will have to shut his shop for good as a result of the attack. She said: “He’s going to have to close down his shop for his safety and no longer go there. He’s in fear of his safety. “This is unacceptable.” Sussex Police released a statement calling for witnesses to come forward with information about the attack. A spokesperson said: ""Police are appealing for witnesses to a serious assault in Battle on Tuesday morning (7 February). ""Emergency services attended Old Ladies Court, near Battle High Street, at around 10.30am. ""A 21-year-old man from Battle suffered serious leg injuries consistent with being stabbed. ""He was taken to Conquest Hospital in Hastings where he remains in a stable condition. ""An investigation is now underway and officers are asking for any witnesses to come forward. ""Detective Sergeant Rob Tillyer said: “This is a fast-moving investigation and our officers are in the process of carrying out extensive enquiries. “I would like to reassure the public that tackling serious violence like this remains a high priority for the force and a thorough investigation is underway.” Any witnesses or anyone who has any information which could help police with their investigation is asked to report online or call 101, quoting serial 378 of 07/02.

Epsom deaths: 'Killer' husband moved back in weeks before 'shooting wife and daughter',"Neighbours suggested that Epsom College headteacher Emma Pattison and her husband George had been living apart in the months leading up to the tragedy, as a sale went through on their former homeThe husband of Epsom College's headteacher had only moved into their home three weeks before allegedly shooting his wife and daughter dead, it is reported. George Pattison, 39, was found dead alongside Emma, 45, and seven-year-old Lettie at their home in the grounds of Epsom College in Surrey on Sunday. Police said Mr Pattison legally owned a gun that was discovered at the scene of the tragedy, and confirmed that a homicide probe has been launched. The deaths are being investigated as a possible murder-suicide. Neighbours have now suggested that Mr and Mrs Pattison had been living apart in the months leading up to the tragedy, as a sale went through on their former home in Caterham.   They claimed Mr Patterson, a chartered accountant, had been ""flitting between that house and the property in Epsom"" up until it was sold for a reported £1.5million last month. One Caterham resident told MailOnline: ""I think [Emma] moved out before George. ""The new owners arrived about three weeks or so ago and just before they moved in, a removal firm had taken away the last remaining bits of furniture belonging to Emma and George from the house. ""It was George who handed the keys over to the estate agents. I think he'd been flitting between that house and the property at Epsom.""  Mrs Pattison had reportedly contacted her sister with concerns about Mr Pattison in the hours before the killings, and when she arrived at the house she found all three members of the family dead.  While a gun was found at the scene, the force said causes of death will not be confirmed until post-mortem examinations are carried out later this week.  Mr Pattison had been in contact with Surrey Police just days before the killings about his gun licence in order to change his address after the family moved to the school site from Caterham.  A statement from the force said: ""We had contact with George on February 2 after he notified us of a previous change of address, as is routine.   ""Due to the short period of time between that contact and this incident, we have made a referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.""  The IOPC said it is assessing the information available to decide if any further action is necessary.  Detective Chief Inspector Kimball Edey, senior investigating officer on the case, said: ""This is an incredibly traumatic incident and we are working around the clock to investigate and understand the exact circumstances which led to this point.  ""We understand the public concern and upset, and we will clarify what we can, when we can, while respecting the right to a level of privacy for the families of those who have lost their lives.""   Mr Pattison had held a gun licence for a number of years and it was up for renewal early last year, according to the Times.  Mrs Pattison became Epsom's first female head in September 2022 after six years as headteacher of Croydon High School in south London. Boarding students at the college pay more than £42,000 a year and its alumni include Conservative MP Sir Michael Fallon, broadcaster Jeremy Vine and comedian Tim Vine.

Brit's 'blood froze' after seeing wife and child caught in Turkey earthquake on babycam,"Lemi, who provides security for Hull City owner Acun Ilicali, was safe in Istanbul when the first quake began but his wife Victoria and their baby daughter Katelyn were in the city of Adana, near the epicentreA dad has described the moment his ""blood froze"" when he saw his wife and newborn hit by the Turkey earthquake on his baby cam 535 miles away. Lemi, who provides security for Hull City owner Acun Ilicali, was safe in Istanbul when the first quake began but his wife Victoria and their baby daughter Katelyn were in the city of Adana, near the epicentre.  Over 9,500 people have died and tens of thousands more are injured and missing. Plus there are still daily tremors causing thousands of families' homes to crumble. Describing the video, he told Hull Live: “You hear a big bang. The baby wakes up and the dog was barking 10-15 seconds prior to it. Vicky wakes up and grabs Katelyn and runs downstairs.    ""You can hear the whole building squeaking and that tapping noise. When you watch it your blood freezes."" Lemi hired a car as soon as he saw what had happened and began the 12-hour drive south.  He describes horrifying scenes of devastation: “In three different locations, I witnessed incidents where 20-30 vehicles were crashed and there were bodies everywhere. It was terrible.""  He managed to reach Adana safely and then took his wife and the grandparents to the city of Mersin on the coast where things are ""slightly better"".  He, Victoria, and Katelyn are trying to stay warm and fed in Mersin but said: “Constantly there are ambulances and rescue services passing by.  ""Some of the petrol stations have run out of fuel because people are panic buying.  “You can't really get bread. Not many shops have got bread. According to the intelligence, with the contacts I have, they are switching the main petrol pipes off to protect from future earthquakes if that happens, which they predict will happen, so there won't be any petrol for a while so everyone's filling their tanks and panicking. “Mersin is normally a summer place but right now it's raining and it’s quite cold. Istanbul is snowing and the middle of Turkey is snowing. The weather conditions make it ten times worse.” Lemi and Victoria plan to buy blankets, baby bodysuits, and nappies for victims once they have gathered a ""decent amount of money"" on a Go Fund Me set up by their friends.

Tory chair says deputy Lee Anderson is 'fantastic asset' despite foodbank rants,"New Conservative chairman Greg Hands dodged questions on Lee Anderson's history of controversial remarks, including suggestions people using foodbanks cannot cook or budget 'properly'The Tories' new Chairman has described his divisive deputy Lee Anderson as a ""fantastic asset"" to the party - despite his controversial past remarks.  Greg Hands' defence came after Rishi Sunak handed Mr Anderson - the MP for Ashfield - the post of deputy Chairman in a mini-reshuffle on Tuesday. Mr Anderson provoked outrage last year during a Commons speech when he suggested people using foodbanks ""cannot cook properly"" and ""cannot budget"". Just two weeks ago the controversial MP also compared the Government to the ""band on the Titanic"" over its asylum seeker policy, according to a string of leaked WhatsApp messages. Pressed on the past remarks, Mr Hands, who was also appointed to the position as party Chairman on Tuesday, said he would not ""give a running commentary on things that may have been said in the past"".

  He added: ""What I will say is that Lee Anderson is a fantastic asset for the party.  ""He is a man of great integrity and fantastic background, former coal miner actually, too, not that long ago, a member of the Labour Party and so he's somebody I think, who brings something different to the party.  ""I think he and I will work very well together"". Quizzed again on LBC, Mr Hands said he had not ""studied every single pronouncement made by Conservative backbenchers"". ""In terms of things that may or may not have been said in the past, I don't have an encyclopedic knowledge of what everybody has ever said in the past"".  Responding to Mr Anderson's appointment last night, Labour's Deputy leader Angela Rayner referred to his previous 'Titanic' comments, saying: ""Update: He's been handed a deck chair"".   Mr Hands, who was appointed to the role as Tory Chairman after the sacking of Nadhim Zahawi, also admitted the upcoming local elections in May will be ""difficult"" for the Tories.  Mr Hands told GB News: ""It's not a secret to say that this year's local elections will be a difficult set of local elections for the party.  ""But the important thing is that we do as well as we can and set the platform for a general election next year."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tory-chair-says-deputy-lee-29163241
"Tributes to 'true gent', 21, who plunged 600ft to death on Snowdonia mountain","A fundraiser has now been launched to support the family of 23-year-old Jack Carne, from Yorkshire, who friends described as a ""true gentleman"" and the ""nicest lad you'll ever meet"".Tributes have poured in for a ""lovely lad"" who tragically died after falling 600ft from a Snowdonia mountain ridge while hiking with two friends at the weekend. Jack Carne, 23, was ascending Y Gribin in North Wales at 5pm on Saturday when a handhold broke, causing him to plunge down the mountainside. Mountain rescue teams were called to the scene and had recovered his body with the help of a coastguard helicopter by Sunday afternoon. A fundraiser has now been launched to support the family of Jack, from Yorkshire, who friends described as a ""true gentleman"" and the ""nicest lad you'll ever meet"".   The GoFundMe says: ""I'm raising funds as my dear friend Jack Carne sadly passed away from a tragic accident on Saturday. ""He will be missed by many. He was never not smiling, he was there for everyone whenever anyone needed him! The funds will be used to help his family who are suffering so bad at the moment due to this tragedy. ""He will be missed by everyone he ever set eyes on."" The page has raised over £6,000 of its £10,000 goal at the time of writing. Jack's devastated girlfriend took to social media to pay an emotional tribute to him, writing: ""Soulmates for ever and ever and ever."" And responding to the rescue team, Jack's grandma wrote: ""A massive thank you to all involved risking your own lives to help my grandson and his friends, we are all heartbroken beyond words.  ""You will be forever in my heart and thoughts Jack my beautiful grandson."" His aunt commented: ""Thankyou to every single person involved for everything you did, putting yourselves at risk to help my nephew and others. Grateful beyond words. From a heartbroken aunt"". Another family member wrote: ""No words can say how grateful we are as a family for your dedication and bravery you put into your work."" A total of 12 OVMRO rescuers searched for his body, which was found in the darkness shortly after 9pm. Chris Lloyd, the chairman of the Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Organisation (OVMRO) and who was part of the rescue effort, said: ""He disappeared into the cloud below, falling a good distance down some very steep and nasty ground. ""His two colleagues saw him go so they tried to scramble to the edge to see where he had gone and climbed down quite a bit. It was becoming really difficult ground and they called for him but there was no response.  ""It is just a tragic accident and very, very unfortunate. The lads have not done anything wrong. This rock just came away in his hand. It is just so sad."" Cloudy conditions, regular rockfalls and widespread ice in the valley meant the rescuers could not attempt to evacuate the man's body until Sunday morning. Mr Lloyd added: ""They were three young men. They have done a lot of hillwalking together and were well-equipped and had all the right kit. ""They were actually going to go and do some wild camping which is why they were so high so late. ""It is quite a popular ridge to go up and it has a little bit of a scramble towards the top so a lot of people walk up there. ""It is not difficult at all but there is loose rock up there, there's no doubt about that. There were definitely good patches of ice. It was just thin layers of it. ""You couldn't really see it and you couldn't tell whether it was wet rock or ice and it is easy to be caught out."" OVMRO was called out 178 times last year and depends almost entirely on public donations to fund its operations. It is one of six volunteer rescue groups in North Wales.

Disabled woman forced to stand up to shut door 'uncaring' landlord hasn't fixed,"Carol Aldridge, 62 is a wheelchair user and said she's been left in a permanent state of ""emotional distress"" following issues with the electric door which she claims is failing to open or close properlyA disabled woman has accused her landlord of being ""uncaring"" in a battle over a door that she claims has rumbled on for more than a year. Carol Aldridge, 62, is a wheelchair user and said she's been left in a permanent state of ""emotional distress"" following issues with the electric door failing to open or close. She lives in her flat owned by Chelmer Housing Partnership (CHP) and says she's had multiple contractors come out over the past 14 months. The housing association insists its staff are in regular contact with Ms Aldrige in providing support, however contests many of her claims. Ms Aldridge said the situation is ""getting out of control"" and complains she's been left at her wits' end. She told the Mirror: ""I find as a disabled lady and wheelchair user it is quite frustrating that I have to go to the door to let people in and that I have to stand up to close the door behind me.""   ""It's disgraceful, depressing and frustrating to deal with the attitude and behaviour of an uncaring landlord."" She claims that she was told there was a fault in the lock and that she has been waiting for a new one to be delivered. She added that before that, she was told it was the fob and the receiver that was faulty. Ms Aldridge, who lives in Chelmsford, Essex, said: ""There was a fault in the lock and I am waiting for that to be delivered, prior to that it was the fob and the receiver.  ""And now I don't know what to believe. ""The guy who came in last week Saturday said it was the lock and another guy came out on the Monday and clarified that. ""The new lock has been ordered but I don't know when it will be delivered.""  Carol first told The Mirror on Friday, January 27 that CHP was still unable to update her on when the lock would arrive and to date, nothing has changed. Carol has cerebral palsy, a lifelong condition that affects a person's ability to move and maintain balance and posture. She has no carer support or family in the area and says she is very independent. The automatic mechanical door was fitted when she moved to the property in 2017 to help her with her limited mobility and lack of strength. She says she does receive housing benefits, but she pays a service charge that goes towards the maintenance of the building.  She said: ""The idea of a door closure fitted is that it opens with a fob and the landlord had put it in to make my life easier."" In a previous statement from November 2021, CHP said they would replace the door, but Ms Aldridge thinks it wasn't put in correctly. She claims: ""It's been over 14 months since it was installed I've had nothing but trouble and it stems back to when it was first installed. ""The people who were installing it didn't know what they were doing. ""Since then I've had numerous callouts and the last one is about the lock. The door has been reprogrammed so many times and a fault has never been found.  ""I pay a service charge and they are not providing me with the service. I am unable to get in and out from my door.""  Ms Aldrdige also claims she's been waiting since May 2022 for another door replacement because her current one isn't fire compliant.  She also added that sometimes the door opens by itself. She said: ""At the moment I am also waiting for the door to be replaced as its not adequate because it's not a fire door. ""I was told in May it was going to be replaced and then late last year was told it was being manufactured and now I'm told it needed specialised work so that it still qualified as a fire door.  ""It's been left in the lap of the gods - when will my door ever be working correctly? ""I suffer with chronic pain anyway and I have limited mobility - I am waiting for a hip replacement so that has a lot of pain and all of this together with the emotional distress. ""It's getting out of control, I need my door fixed as soon as possible, I am a disabled woman with a nonfunctioning door, which is absolutely useless. ""Also the arm on the mechanism part of the door would occasionally open on its own. ""It was resolved at one time but it still happens. It is a manual door with the power switched off."" A CHP spokesperson told The Mirror: “We know Carol extremely well and speak with her often. We work closely with her and always do everything possible to resolve any issues she reports. We are very sensitive to her needs, and several of our team take extra time to care for her. As recently as last night (January 26) one manager took time out of his day to spend two hours with her and another manager spent 90-minutes on a social visit the day before. “Whenever she has told us about a repair we have visited her home to identify the issue and, if there has been a problem, we have fixed it promptly. This includes a recent call about a fault with the electronic closer on the door to her flat inside the sheltered accommodation where she lives.  ""The engineers from our specialist electronic door contractor found there was a problem with the catch, so we have ordered a replacement. Carol told us she was happy we would not be able to confirm the date for completing the repair until we knew when the new part would be delivered. We said that as soon as we know she will too. We expect this will be very soon. “The electronic door closer was removed as a temporary measure by the specialist engineers when they returned to visit Carol two days after the initial visit. This means the door currently functions manually and with her full agreement for her peace of mind, so she knows that the door will remain shut when she closes it. Out of care for Carol we offered to move her into a hotel until the replacement part arrives and the electronic closer can be re-fitted. She declined. If she changes her mind, we will be happy to help. “In a separate recent report, she said that the door has opened its own. However, when the engineers visited, they were unable to recreate this or to identify anything that might cause it to happen. “With regards to the claim that she has been waiting for a new door since May 2022, this is not the case. Nor is her current door unsafe. We check the fire safety of her door each year and the fire safety of the communal areas in her block each week. We also do fire safety checks inside her flat every six months. These confirm she is not in any immediate risk and that her door will provide protection in the event of a fire. “The new door is part of a planned programme of investment that we will complete by 31 March 2023. Carol’s door is currently being manufactured and we will confirm the installation date with her shortly.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/disabled-woman-forced-stand-up-29056493
Leopard breaks into court and injures several people before being locked in cage,"A giant leopard stormed the Ghaziabad District court premises in Uttar Pradesh, Northern India, entering the first floor where it attacked multiple victimsA leopard has broken into a court room and injured several people. The animal stormed the Ghaziabad District court premises in Uttar Pradesh, Northern India.  The leopard entered the Chief Judicial Magistrate's court on the first floor where it attacked multiple victims.  It is believed three people have been taken to hospital following the attack.  A team of police were alerted to the incident and officials managed to trap the leopard.  The victims have been rushed to hospital where they are being treated for their injuries.  In the frantic video people are seen rushing to safety as they attempt to run away from the huge leopard.  According to reports, the leopard attacked and injured several people out of the court room before heading inside.    The leopard attack comes just days after a 11-year-old boy was mauled to death in Mysore, India.  It is believed the animal, estimated to be around five-year-old, was captured last Thursday from Horalahalli village. According to officials, the animal was trapped by the Karnataka Forest Department after already killing and attacking another boy. The boy, only identified as Jayanth, had been reported missing from the Horalahalli village since Saturday evening.  His body was found mauled just a mile outside of his village.  The capture of the animal has brought relief to the local community who had been living in fear of the leopard. Since October 2022 there have been four leopard attacks in India which saw three women and a 11-year-old boy killed.   On October 31, there was a 31-year-old college student, named as Manjunath, who was killed by a big cat in Ukkalagere, India.  And in December another college student was killed as she was on her way to her family's farm for Christmas.  The leopard was eventually captured but the attacks continued into 2023.  A woman, only named as Siddamma, was killed on January 20 and forced a special team to be assigned to capture the leopard.  Basavraj Bomma, Karnataka Chief Minister, announced plans to trap the leopard as dozens of locals have moved from the area out of fear, according to reports.  Ashwin Kumar, from the Narasipura assembly constituency, demanded action for his constituents. He said: ""Locals are scared of continuous leopard attacks. A lot of leopards and cubs have settled in the area.  ""Action must be taken to remove the animals from the district.""

'Strong indications' Vladimir Putin supplied missile that shot down MH17 passenger jet,"It has been proven that the aircraft was hit by a Russian-made missile over Ukraine and prosecutors said there is evidence that Russian President Putin decided to provide the missile to Moscow-backed separatistsThere are ""strong indications"" that Vladimir Putin ""decided on supplying"" a Buk missile system to Ukrainian separatists which downed flight MH17, Dutch prosecutors have said. In the tragedy on July 17, 2014, 298 people, including 10 Britons, were killed when a missile shot down the plane heading from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. It has been proven that the aircraft was hit by a Russian-made missile over Ukraine and prosecutors said there is evidence that Russian President Putin decided to provide the missile to Moscow-backed separatists. However, Dutch prosecutor Digna van Boetzelaer said ""Although a lot of new information has been discovered about various people involved, the evidence is at the moment not concrete enough to lead to new prosecutions.""   There is no suggestion that Mr Putin was involved in ordering the aircraft to be shot down. Russia has always denied any involvement in the downing of MH17. The announcement comes nearly three months after a Dutch court convicted two Russians and a Ukrainian rebel for their roles in shooting down the Boeing 777 and killing all 298 people on board on July 17, 2014. One Russian was acquitted by the court. The convictions and the court's findings were seen as a clear indication that Moscow had a role in the tragedy. The Russian Foreign Ministry accused the court in November of bowing to pressure from Dutch politicians, prosecutors and the news media. The convictions in November found that the Buk missile system came from the Russian military's 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, based in the city of Kursk.  The plane was carrying 193 Dutch nationals. There were 43 Malaysians (including 15 crew), 27 Australians, 12 Indonesians, 10 Britons, four Germans, four Belgians, three Filipinos, one Canadian and one New Zealander on board. The Brits were John Alder, 63, and Liam Sweeney, 28, two Newcastle United fans travelling to watch their team play; Glenn Thomas, 49, a spokesman for the World Health Organisation; Loughborough University student Ben Pocock, 20; Dog breeder Robert Ayley, 28; Andrew Hoare and his Dutch wife Estella; University of Leeds student Richard Mayne, 20; Former RAF search and rescue co-ordinator Stephen Anderson; and helicopter pilot Cameron Dalziel.

"Predator who raped and murdered student Libby Squire got £110,000 in legal aid","Evil Pawel Relowicz benefited from thousands from the taxpayer after he was charged with the murder of Hull student Libby Squire, whose grieving mother he has refused to meetThe murderer who raped and killed student Libby Squire benefited from nearly £110k in taxpayer's cash, legal aid figures reveal. Some £109,563.35 was spent on butcher Pawel Relowicz's defence team when he went on trial in 2021 for the horrific crime in Hull two years prior. Philosophy student Libby, 21, disappeared following a night with friends when the married 28-year-old predator attacked her in a park before later dumping her body in a river. Evil Relowicz later laughed as he was charged with Libby's murder, and has since refused to meet her grieving mum Lisa Squire as part of a restorative justice project.    The Polish national was caged for life in February 2021 and told he would serve a minimum of 27 years - a sentence which he has since appealed. His legal aid bill, obtained by MailOnline, comes as Libby's family last week marked four years since her senseless murder. The bright student, originally from West Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, had been turned away from a popular student nightclub on the night of January 31. CCTV showed Libby wandering along a busy road away from her home after being dropped off by a taxi, before sex offender Relowicz's silver Astra was also caught on camera nearby.  The young father had previously been caught peering through windows watching young women and masturbating, and Humberside Police charged him with voyeurism and burglary charges before later charging him with the murder. A search of his house also turned up multiple items such as underwear and sex toys he had stolen after breaking into women's homes in Hull. In October last year, it was revealed Relowicz had agreed to meet Libby's mum face to face. However, his appointment was cancelled the following month after claiming he was appealing his sentence.  A statement from the Ministry of Justice's Legal Aid Agency said: ""Legal aid is not paid directly to defendants.  ""Legal aid is paid to solicitors and barristers for the provision of legal representation to ensure a fair trial.  ""Anyone facing a crown court trial is eligible for legal aid, subject to a strict means test.  ""Depending on their means, applicants for criminal legal aid can be required to pay contributions up to the entire cost of the defence, if they are convicted of at least one offence with which they are charged.""

Dis Life: 'Putting an actor in a fat suit to play an obese character on screen is ableist hogwash',"Anna Morell, who works for Disability Rights UK, says actor Brendan Fraser's interviews about his role in a fat suit, beg the question: why are we still using fat suits like this?Oscar-nominated movie The Whale is about a disabled fat bloke. See what they did there? Except they didn’t, because they shoehorn in a lot of stuff about the whale-chasing novel, Moby Dick. How sixth form! The upshot is that the whole thing is absolute ableist hogwash. Brendan Fraser is all over the media at the moment talking about his role in a fat suit, which begs the question: why are we still using fat suits like this? A fat suit that doesn’t move like real fat. Around an actor who doesn’t sweat or breathe like a real obese person. It’s ableist. Eye rolling. Excruciating. Obesity is, for some, a disability. There are a ton of fat talented people out there who can’t get screentime because society is constantly told through the fact that we are invisible in media as fat or fat and disabled people (Lizzo, Robbie Coltrane and Dawn French aside), that screens are not for us. We shouldn’t be on them.   And as long as we’re lauding an actor with good intentions who has staged a triumphant comeback, there’s no room to discuss the fact that this is… fatface. It sounds way more clownish than yellowface, or blackface, but it’s essentially the same thing. Another barrier to a fat or fat and disabled person being given a role they are born to play. Another role where people with mobility issues, and users of oxygen tanks, are pushed aside for a non-disabled person to play such roles. Director Darren Aronofsky is on the record as saying: ""Outside of not being able to find an actor who could pull off the emotions of the role, it just becomes a crazy chase. Like, if you can't find a 600-pound actor, is a 300-pound actor or 400-pound actor enough?""  Which is nonsense. Fat people can't act with the right emotions. I don't believe that for a second. He goes on: ""From a health perspective, it's prohibitive... It's an impossible role to fill with a real person dealing with those issues."" Is it? Or is it a question of making adaptations. You know, not being ableist? It’s the My Left Foot or Elephant Man of our generation. A film where we are supposed to admire the tragic but brave lead, ‘empathise’ with them, but really, the narrative leaves no room for anything but pity.  The whole story is a giant, mawkish, overplayed pity party for an infinifat fat bloke with poor mental health and even worse coping mechanisms (spoiler – junk food, eaten with self-loathing, until – another spoiler – he lurches towards his estranged daughter, and is lifted heavenward into the light he seeks.  Although in reality he’d collapse and crash land on her, causing her another decade of trauma. Hurrah for poetic hammy licence! Obese people do not behave like this. We do not think or feel like this. We lead complex, rich lives. Our disabilities and challenges come with a whole host of other angles completely overlooked by this (ha!) thin little film.  In an ideal world, all the people would be able to play all the roles. But it’s not an ideal world. And where disabled people, and especially fat disabled people, can’t get roles in anywhere near the quantities representative of the number of us there are in the world, roles like this should be ours. I say ‘like’ this, because the role is so bad and the film is so bad, that on one level I’m glad a disabled person has been spared the horror of having to defend it. The Hollywood Reporter is quoted in the trailer as saying of Brendan Fraser: “The humanity of his performance will floor you.” But in truth, it was the banality of the performance which floored me.   I’m a fat knackered person. I’m nowhere near this dull and self-loathing. And neither are any of the other fat people I know. It’s a massively false representation of what fat disabled lives look like. It’s a missed opportunity. I can’t remember another film in recent memory where a fat disabled person’s story has been told front and centre. But there are a lot of fat people out there. A lot of stories. Why do we need this one? Where the emotional dynamics are painted with fat child brushes by numbers. Where everyone is a stereotype.  Where the fat disabled person is a giant failure reinforcing every stereotype about fat disabled lives, what leads to fatness, and what our responses to fat disabled people should be (revulsion with a sprinkle of admiration and/or pity to make us feel better as those doing the judging). It’s lazy storytelling, held up as do-gooding. A disappointing dud from A24 – the risk-taking production company which brought us Everything Everywhere All At Once.  If they can hold up older women – another marginalised group – with such power, grace and kickass storytelling, then they can do the same for disabled people. Maybe. Next time.

Rishi Sunak refuses to apologise for Liz Truss chaos after she said she has no regrets,"At an unusually non-confrontational PMQs, the Prime Minister was challenged over Liz Truss's remarks, when SNP Westminster Stephen Flynn asked him to apologise for the damage she causedRishi Sunak today refused to apologise for the damage inflicted on the UK by Liz Truss - days after his predecessor said she had no regrets. The under-fire current PM was challenged at an unusually non-confrontational PMQs dominated by discussion of the war in Ukraine. Earlier this week Ms Truss blamed others for her failure in a much-criticised 'comeback' causing yet another headache for Mr Sunak. SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn told MPs: ""In recent days the former Prime Minister said she doesn't regret her time in office. ""Does the Prime Minister regret her time in office?"" As politicians from all sides of the chamber laughed, Mr Sunak responded: ""I'm grateful to all my predecessors for the contribution they make to public life.""   The SNP head persisted, saying: ""Let's reflect on the damage that was caused - £30 billion wiped off the UK economy, pension funds brought to the brink of collapse, the pound reaching parity with the dollar and interest rates for mortgage holders right across these Isles soaring. ""The former Prime Minister won't apologise for the damage that she's caused, so on behalf of the Tory party, will he apologise for her?"" The uncomfortable-looking PM told the Commons: ""On the first day I took office I said mistakes had been made."" Earlier this week whining Ms Truss has claimed it is “unfair” for struggling families to blame her for soaring mortgage rates. The unapologetic ex-PM refused to accept responsibility for tanking the economy as she continued her shameless bid to whitewash her appalling record.  In her first interview since leaving No10, Ms Truss dismissed complaints that households have been lumbered with higher mortgage costs thanks to her botched mini-Budget. Ms Truss was forced out of Downing Street after just 49 days after she announced a tax-cutting bonanza, with giveaways for the super-rich. Asked by the Spectator if she regrets running for the top job, Ms Truss said: “No, I don’t regret it.” She added: “I definitely want to be part of promoting a pro-growth agenda, I definitely want to carry on as an MP. I’m positive about the future of Britain and I’m positive about the future of the Conservative Party. “I think we need to start building more of a strong intellectual base. But I’m not desperate to get back into Number 10, no.” Mortgage rates have risen dramatically since Ms Truss entered No10 this summer. The cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage stood at an eye-watering 5.75% last month, according to Moneyfacts, compared to 3.95% in August, the month before her disastrous mini-budget.  The under-pressure Prime Minister today welcomes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has made a surprise visit to the UK for the first time since the Russian invasion began nearly a year ago. His plane touched down at Stansted Airport at 10.22am for the surprise trip, where he was met on the tarmac by Mr Sunak. Mr Starmer told the House of Commons: ""He symbolises the resolve and the bravery of his people."" The heroic war leader travelled to London with the Prime Minister in a motorcade and the pair walked up Downing Street together where a red carpet was laid out. Applause could be heard from staff behind the famous black door as Mr Zelensky arrived, which is highly unusual when a foreign leader visits No10. Mr Zelensky thanked Britain for its ""big support from the first days of full-scale invasion"" as he went inside to hold talks with Mr Sunak after the Prime Minister announced plans to train Ukrainian pilots to allow them to fly sophisticated NATO-standard fighter jets. Mr Zelensky and Mr Sunak will visit Ukrainian troops being trained in Britain later today.  Earlier today the new Tory Party chairman warned that the government faces a difficult time in coming months. In a message to Tory supporters, urging them to become members and help swell the party's war chest, Greg Hands said ""the next 18 months will see us win or lose the next general election"", in a hint that Rishi Sunak could go to the country in September next year. May's elections will give an early indication of the scale of the challenge facing Mr Sunak following months of opinion polls giving Labour a clear lead. Mr Hands told GB News: ""It's not a secret to say that this year's local elections will be a difficult set of local elections for the party. ""But the important thing is that we do as well as we can and set the platform for a general election next year."" He told Sky News that the party ""is overall in good shape"". ""Membership is improving, the financial position of the party, I think, is improving. I'm definitely up for it. I know Rishi Sunak is up for it. ""We're really looking forward to taking on Sir Keir Starmer's unreformed Labour Party and the other parties as well. ""I think the Conservative Party will have a really good story to tell at next year's general election and we're definitely looking forward to it.""

Boris Johnson pockets £2.5million as he signs up to after-dinner speaking agency,"Disgraced ex-prime minister Boris Johnson has earned a total of £4.8 million so far as he travels the world cashing in on his scandal-filled time in Downing StreetBoris Johnson has raked in £2.5million just by signing up to an after-dinner speech agency. The lucrative fee takes his earnings in the past year to a whopping £4.8million. Mr Johnson is by far the highest-paid MP as he cashes in on his disastrous time as PM. According to the latest register of interests, the Harry Walker speaking agency in New York has given him a £2.5million advance. A gushing profile of Mr Johnson on its website advertises him as a “visionary thinker who takes risks for the principles of democracy, freedom and free markets”. The agency says the ex-PM is “sought-after for his illuminating insights on global security, the world economy, and his continued work supporting freedom around the world”.   It describes him as a “champion of democracy, freedom, and free market capitalism”. However, the profile makes no mention of the series of scandals that forced him from power. Other after-dinner speakers represented by the agency include Serena Williams, as well as Bill and Hillary Clinton. Since leaving No10 in September, Mr Johnson has so far earned £1.8million in speaking fees. His engagements have included an event in Washington DC for the Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers and a speech for New York-based investment bank Centreview Partners. He travelled to Delhi for a gathering organised by the Hindustan Times and to Singapore to address a firm involved in artificial intelligence. Mr Johnson has also received a £510,000 advance for his upcoming memoirs.  News of Mr Johnson’s latest earnings comes just a fortnight after it emerged that the taxpayer could end up spending more than £222,000 on the former PM’s legal fees for the upcoming Commons inquiry into whether he misled Parliament over Partygate. No10 has insisted there is precedent for ex-ministers to get legal support for anything relating to their duties while in government. But Labour has accused Rishi Sunak of “writing a blank cheque for the disgraced prime minister’s legal fund”. Mr Johnson announced his resignation as PM in July after most of his Cabinet quit their jobs in protest. He stepped down in September after Liz Truss was elected as Tory leader. When she was forced out weeks later, Mr Johnson attempted to stage a comeback. But he withdrew from the leadership contest as he failed to match the support Mr Sunak had from Tory MPs.

Four rushed to hospital in beach dog attack as family pet suffers horrific injuries,"Police are investigating after a woman claims her six-year-old Siberian Husky called Naevia was set upon by two bulldog-style pets while on Redcar beach in Yorkshire on Sunday Three women and a man have been hospitalised with dog attack injuries after three dogs came to blows on a busy beach.  Police are investigating after a woman claims her six-year-old Siberian Husky called Naevia was set upon by two bulldog-style pets while on Redcar beach on Sunday.  Marie Hay said she's now left with a £14,000 bill after vets battled to save the life of her beloved pup, who has been left with life-changing injuries. Cleveland Police has confirmed that counter-claims have been made by the other dogs' owner and they are looking into what took place. Mum-of-three Ms Hay said she was looking forward to letting Naevia have a paddle in the sea but was devastated when her peaceful walk turned to heartbreak. The 40-year-old said two dogs who ""weren't wearing any collars or harnesses"", approached Naevia.  She claims their owner called out to her that they were 'friendly' but just moments later one of them was said to have launched at the husky.    Mrs Hay from Nunthorpe, North Yorkshire said: ""[The] dog came over and sniffed my dog, and then done a little scuffle and made a noise and then just jumped on her and bit her face and wouldn't let go.  ""So [the owner] came running over to try and get the dog, but his dogs had no collars or leads on, they didn't have harnesses or leads, nothing at all.  ""So there was no way of grabbing them to get them off.""  She said the second dog ran over and jumped on the family pet as members of the public rushed to help.  Mrs Hay estimated that the incident lasted for around 10 minutes, with a group of people visiting the beach trying to pin the dogs to floor, getting injured themselves in the process. Both Marie and her 20-year-old daughter Jessica had to be treated for their bite wounds, with the latter needing antibiotics and a tetanus injection.  Naevia has spent several days undergoing surgery to ensure she could make the best recovery.  Mrs Hay added: ""Them dogs kept coming and coming and coming and what they've done is they've punctured her skin and pulled it that much that it's almost like an autopsy.   ""They've severed the skin that badly off her chest that they've had to remove the skin from her chest to get to her muscles and all of her muscles are dying and going black. ""She's had to be fully shaved, she's got multiple lacerations on her face, on her neck she's got multiple bite wounds where they've gone for the kill.  ""She's got bite marks down her back legs and backside, a slash underneath her armpit where the dog literally was playing tug of war with her leg and trying to pull her leg off."" She added: ""I am a responsible dog owner [so she is insured] but not for one second do you think it will cost more than £4,000 if something happens. The cap on the insurance is £4,000 per event."" Marie has now launched a GoFundMe page to raise the money needed to save her 'gorgeous' dog's life.   A spokesman for the Cleveland police force said: ""Police were called to the beach near the caravan park at Redcar just after 3pm on Sunday, 5th February to a report of a dog attack by two bulldog-type pets on a husky. ""Officers attended the scene and took initial details including a counter allegation from the bulldogs’ owner. It’s understood at least one dog received veterinary treatment and a man and three women attended hospital for treatment - primarily for hand injuries. ""As part of ongoing inquiries we are obtaining more detailed accounts as well as details of any confirmed injuries to the dogs and people involved. ""Police have already spoken to a number of independent witnesses but would appeal for anyone who saw the incident or who may have footage of it to contact Cleveland Police on 101.""

DWP sparks fury with plans to shut down 20 Jobcentres in UK throwing dozens on dole,"The Department for Work and Pensions has sparked fury from GMB members with the news that it plans to close 20 job centres and put more than 50 jobs at risk from the schemeWorkers have reacted angrily with the Department for Work and Pensions' announcement that it plans to close 20 job centres. More than 50 jobs will be put at risk by the scheme, which emerged on Tuesday night and sparked fury from GMB members. It's understood future plans could lead to more closures and further job losses. Eamon O’Hearn, GMB National Officer, said that the plans would also undermine the Government's talk of ""growing the labour force"". “The proposal to close DWP sites will not only cost jobs but will undermine Government rhetoric about growing the labour force,"" he said.   ""Closures will undoubtedly impact on services and represent a screeching U-turn on the original programme to extend the reach of DWP into communities. “GMB members, who work as security at these sites, will have their jobs and futures put at risk. ""This plan makes no sense when the Government is touting warm words on growth and employment.” It is the latest poor economic news for the country hit by the cost-of-living crisis. Issuing its quarterly monthly outlook, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research has claimed that the UK “will likely avoid a protracted recession” this year - but economic growth “will remain close to zero” at just 0.2%.   And last week the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that Brits are set for more misery this year as the economy will slam into reverse - seeing the worst performance of all the advanced nations. In its latest World Economic Outlook update, the IMF downgraded its UK gross domestic product (GDP) forecast once again, predicting a contraction of 0.6% against the 0.3% growth pencilled in last October as Britain looks set to suffer more than most from soaring inflation and higher interest rates. The grim outlook for the year ahead puts the UK far behind its counterparts in the G7 group of advanced nations and the only country - across advanced and emerging economies - expected by the IMF to suffer a year of declining GDP. Among the other G7 nations, the IMF's 2023 GDP predictions show growth of 1.4% in the United States, 0.1% in Germany, 0.7% in France, 0.6% in Italy, 1.8% in Japan and 1.5% in Canada.

Walmart bomb threats: Stores targeted across US with 'multiple calls',"Walmart stores across the US have been targeted by phone calls reporting bombs, according to an update from the New Hampshire Department of SafetyBomb threats have been called in to multiple Walmarts across the US.

UK snow: Met Office issues yellow warning as major blizzard sweeps toward Britain,"Snow is expected in the UK as the Met Office issues further yellow warnings, with a major blizzard sweeping across the country. The forecaster says the conditions will be 'dangerous'Brits are told to brace for an Arctic blast as yellow warnings are issued around the country. The Met Office issued snow and ice weather warnings for Wednesday and Thursday, predicting a brutal blizzard will freeze the UK this week. The warning covers large parts of Scotland, with another warning forecasting ""dangerous"" strong winds on the west coast. The yellow warnings will remain in place until at least 9am on Thursday, it said.  It comes after long-range forecasts from the Met Office indicated a major Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW), causing a repeat of the 'Beast from the East' snowstorm. The forecaster warned of further reduced visibility due to the thick fog leading to major travel disruptions.   The Met Office said the weather would bring ""travel disruption and dangerous coastal conditions"" and told commuters to expect slower journey times on buses, trains and planes. People are also advised to take time on slippery icy surfaces walking on some could lead to injuries from slips.  The South East area had a warning earlier today, which expired at 11am this morning. The Met Office said the East would see ""freezing fog"", with visibility reduced to just 50 to 100 metres in some places.   The Met Office Forecast: Wednesday: Frosty with patchy dense freezing fog across central and southern areas, clearing to leave sunny spells. Very windy in the north with a band of heavy rain moving southeast across Scotland and Northern Ireland, turning to snow over the Highlands later. Thursday: Cloud and drizzle in the south clearing, then dry with sunny spells. Occasional showers further north, heavy and wintry in far north, where still windy.  Outlook for Friday to Sunday: Dry with patchy cloud and sunny intervals, and pockets of overnight frost and fog. Strong winds across the north Friday along with some rain for the far northwest. Milder everywhere. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uk-snow-met-office-issues-29164375
Nicola Bulley: Everything we know about devoted mum - from family ties to loving dog owner,"Nicola Bulley vanished after dropping her daughters Harriet, 9, and Sophia, 6, at their primary school on Friday, January 27. The search at St Michael's on Wyre, in Lancashire is entering its 12th dayNicola Bulley has been missing for 12 days and police are no closer to understanding what happened to her.  Known as Nikki to those that love her, the agonising wait for answers is almost too much to bear for her partner Paul, her sister Louise and her devoted parents Ernest and Dot. But the 45-year-old is also known as mummy to her two little girls - Harriet, 9, and Sophia, 6 - who are ""missing their mummy desperately"". Since she dropped her children off at their primary school on Friday, January 27 and getting Willow, the family dog ready for a walk, no-one has seen or heard from her.  Devoted and loving mum Just weeks ago the family had enjoyed a break together in Center Parcs filled with smiling faces and cozy cuddles as they got ready to celebrate Christmas.  Weeks later the family is waiting for news. As well as being a dedicated mother, Nikki is a self-employed mortgage and protection adviser, according to her LinkedIn profile, so it appears she set her own agenda and didn't need to be at her desk by 9am. She was born in Thurrock in Essex, but moved to Lancashire 25 years ago, followed by her parents Ernest, 73, and Dot, 72, and sister Louise Cunningham. She was briefly married to local businessman Simon Booth, who is now engaged to actress Jodie Prenger, who plays Glenda Shuttleworth in Coronation Street, before meeting her partner, Paul Ansell, in a pub 12 years ago. On her Facebook page, she shared images from her life in the country as a family of four.  Mum doted on children Before Christmas, the dedicated mum shared photos of her naughty Elf on the Shelf antics as they invited her children to a fun weekend at Centre Parcs Winter Wonderland.  The mum looked in her element with the car packed as her girls beamed with excitement. Photo after photo followed, giving a glimpse into the family unit as they enjoyed their time together with Christmas lights and log fires.  Nicola's partner Paul Ansell said everyone is desperate to know what happened to her. Read More
 He added that Nicola's two daughters ""miss their mummy desperately"" and have been going through ""a tough time"" since her disappearance. Mr Ansell said: ""I have two little girls who miss their mummy desperately and who need her back. ""This has been such a tough time for the girls especially but also for me and all of Nicola’s family and friends, as well as the wider community and I want to thank them for their love and support. ""We are also really grateful to Peter and his team from SGI for coming up and helping support the work of Lancashire Police as they continue their investigation.""  Loving pet owner Nikki would often take her dog Willow out for walks and the pet is often seen in her selfie and family shots, being cared for as one of the family.  The springer spaniel was found bone dry on the riverbank the day Nicola went missing and she was seen on CCTV getting him ready for his regular walk.  The family has said that it was normal for Willow to have her harness removed and it was found on the floor by detectives. Family and friends' tight-knit relationships There are many photos that give a glimpse into Nicola's life and pictures show her enjoying her time and socialising with friends.  Many have spoken to the press in recent days to talk about the woman they know and her tight family connections. Nicola's friend Tilly Ann posted on Facebook - with the family's permission - in an effort to dispel some myths being spread. She said: ""Paul and Nikki both mostly work from home which is why he was at home that day. ""They have CCTV and there is a reason why Paul has never been a suspect. ""Family and friends need these accusations to stop immediately. The fact that I've had to write this is disgusting to be honest."" Paul released another heartfelt plea over the weekend saying the family needs a ""happy ending to this nightmare"". He added: ""The agony continues but the hope is stronger than ever of finding you.""  Parents saw her weekly before disappearance Speaking to the Mirror earlier this week, Nicola's parents vowed they would ""never stop looking for her"". They said the disappearance of the 45-year-old mum from in Inskip, Lancashire, was totally out of character, Ernest saying she had no health problems and was in good spirits enjoying her job. Recalling their last conversation, he said: ""Her mind was great, we picked the children up the Thursday before she went missing, as we do every Thursday.  ""We took them home, Nicola had had a meeting with her boss in Garstang and she said can you stay a bit later because I have an important client coming in on Zoom. We said 'no problem' and stayed. ""She had done her work and she was very upbeat about getting her mortgage sorted. ""I said we better go now and Nicola came to the front door, and I gave her a kiss and told her I loved her and that was the last conversation I had with her.""  Family grateful for expert help The family has said it's grateful for Peter Faulding's help in the search. Mr Faulding is a dive search specialist with years of experience in hundreds of similar cases, and his company has carried out a sonar search of the area.  But speaking today, he says he doesn't believe Nicola is in the river, having searched the area extensively with his team and their equipment. ""I don’t think she fell in the water. That's just my opinion with all the drownings I've dealt with over the years,"" he said. ""They normally go down and the police dive team are brilliant, they know what they're doing, professional, they would have found her, as we would've done. ""We locate people quickly. That's what I'm shocked with, that she's disappeared.""  Sister Louise says no evidence of river fall Louise Cunningham agrees there is 'no evidence' her beloved sister Nicola fell into the river.  Writing on Facebook she asked the public not to give up sharing information about Nikki.  In the post, in which she tagged her sister's partner Paul, Louise wrote: ""Please keep sharing my Nikki...Off the back of the latest police media update, please can I add there is no evidence whatsoever that she has gone into the river, it's just a theory.  ""Everyone needs to keep an open mind as not all cctv and leads have been investigated fully, the police confirmed the case is far from over."" There has been no trace of Nicola in the last 12 days.

Sister shields little brother from rubble during 3-day wait for help after earthquake,"The elder girl is seen gently stroking her younger brother’s head as they lie wedged between what appears to be the remains of their bed and a collapsed concrete wall, in Besnaya-Bseineh, a small village in Haram, SyriaA brother and sister spent an agonising three days stuck in the rubble of their home in northern Syria after Monday’s devastating earthquake. ""Get me out of here, I’ll do anything for you,"" the older child is heard whispering to rescuers who are seen on video trying to aid the pair at the children’s home in Besnaya-Bseineh, a small village in Haram, Syria. Twin earthquakes — the first a magnitude 7.8 and the second a 7.5 — hit Turkey and neighbouring Syria, killing over 8,000 people in its wake and leaving tens of thousands more injured and missing. The elder girl is seen gently stroking her younger brother’s head as they lie wedged between what appears to be the remains of their bed and a collapsed concrete wall.   “I’ll be your servant,” she says the rescuer, in desperation of being saved. She manages to just move her arm in the small space available and covers the small boy's face, to protect him from falling dust and rubble. The children's father Mustafa Zuhir Al-Sayed told CNN that he, his wife and three children were sleeping in the early hours of Monday when the ground began to shake.  ""We felt the ground shaking… and rubble began falling over our head, and we stayed two days under the rubble. We went through, a feeling, a feeling I hope no one has to feel,"" he said. Mr Al-Sayed said his family recited the Quran and prayed out loud that someone would find them. He continued: ""People heard us, and we were rescued - me, my wife and the children. Thank God, we are all alive and we thank those who rescued us.""  The children have now been taken to hospital where they are receiving medical care. While the death toll is officially higher in Turkey, Syria is receiving markedly less aid and firefighting the double blow of the earthquake and nearly 12 years of war. Even before the earthquake hit, the United Nations said the number of people in need of humanitarian support was greater than at any point since the war began, with 70 percent of the population requiring aid.

Urgent warning to parents over £1.50 ‘choking hazard’ confetti balloons from Asda,"Parents have branded Asda's George Home confetti balloons 'dangerous' after accidentally inhaling and almost choking on pieces of confetti while inflating the party accessoriesParents have hit out at Asda after claims their confetti balloons could pose a choking hazard to people blowing them up. The party balloons by the supermarket's George Home brand come with confetti inside, which some customers claim to have nearly choked on after accidentally inhaling them. Mum Sara Dawson said she was left coughing and spluttering after one piece of confetti was accidentally sucked to the back of her throat while inflating the decoration. The 42-year-old parent from Keighley, West Yorkshire, branded the balloons ""bloody dangerous"". ""We were blowing them up and when you inhale to exhale again, the confetti gets sucked into the back of your throat,"" she said.   ""My daughter laughed at me while she was blowing hers up and then she inhaled them herself - for a second it was actually quite scary.""  Georgie Young, 31, sparked debate after posting about the balloons on Facebook after she found it difficult and ""long-winded"" to add the confetti.  But other parents responded saying they feared their children may swallow the confetti - which could be dangerous.  Asda's packaging makes it clear the product is a potential hazard, that a pump is recommended and children should be supervised. One mum from south London said she too nearly choked on the product. Chloe, 29, who did not want to give her last name, said: ""It was extremely fiddly getting the confetti in, and when I went to blow up the balloon, I ended up with a mouthful of the stuff. ""It took a few seconds before I managed to get it all out before choking.  ""At first I thought it was funny, hence the expression in the photo. But if that was a child it would have definitely been a huge choking issue."" Mum Jamie Newman bought the balloons for her daughter's birthday when she accidentally got one of the pieces of confetti lodged in her throat. ""Instead of going into the balloon it all shot to the back of my throat and got stuck for a few seconds,"" said Jamie, 37, from Baldock, Hertfordshire. ""But luckily I managed to cough it out.""  A spokesperson for Asda said: ""There are clear instructions on the packaging of this product which state that the use of a balloon pump is recommended. ""There are also warnings advising that the product is not suitable for children. ""If a customer has an issue with any of our products, we encourage them to contact us directly so that we can try to understand their concerns.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/urgent-warning-parents-over-150-29166070
"Girl, 14, who got 'butterflies' dancing with boy at prom discovers she nearly died","Ceirra Zeager had a racing heart when she danced with a boy for the first time at her winter formal, and said it continued to pound long after she had returned homeA 14-year-old girl who experienced ""butterflies"" at a school dance was shocked upon later finding out she had survived a heart attack. Ceirra Zeager had a racing heart when she danced with a boy for the first time at her winter formal and said it continued to pound long after she had returned home. Ceirra, now 23, told Insider she didn't know what to make of the experience and thought: 'Is this how it is to have feelings?' But the next morning, the Pennsylvania student's ""butterflies"" had turned into a deep fatigue and heaviness in her arm. She attempted to walk to her parent's room for help but had her vision narrow and her ear begin to burn. She then collapsed. ""Before I knew it, I was on the floor,"" Ceirra said. ""It felt like an elephant was on my chest."" When Ceirra's dad saw her on the ground, he asked if the family needed to go to the hospital instead of her brother's birthday party, to which she said yes.    At the hospital, Ceirra said there was little sense of urgency - she waited for hours to be seen and despite having an ""intense burning pain"" in her upper arm, she wasn't given pain medicine.  She has since learned that arm pain can often be a sign of heart attacks in women.  Eventually, she was seen by a doctor, who told her she likely had ""teen anxiety"". The news left her embarrassed, she said as her whole family was at the hospital and she felt she was ruining her brother's birthday get-together.  The doctor recommended Zeager visit a children's hospital to be safe and while there, tests identified in or around Ceirra's heart. She underwent a cardiac catheterisation procedure to identity the location of the clot and woke up from the surgery to see her sister crying.  ""You had a heart attack,"" she told Ceirra.  Ceirra's story comes just days after the British Heart Foundation published a study finding females were 50 percent more likely to be wrongly diagnosed when it comes to coronary problems than men. Heart attacks killed around 77 British women every day, but many have the incidents dismissed as heartburn, anxiety or ‘a funny turn’. A study, published in the journal Circulation, also found that indigestion was a common symptom experienced by women in the month leading up to their cardiac event. Tests Ceirra underwent after doctors correctly diagnosed her found she had elevated lipoprotein A, which found red blood cells were ""extra sticky"" and had subsequently clotted. She had also been born with a hole in her heart, called patent foramen ovale (PFO). This had allowed the clot to get lodged in her coronary artery, causing the heart attack. Although around a quarter of people have PFO, it did not typically cause problems alone. The condition had become dangerous for Ceirra due to her high ipoprotein A levels. The teen underwent surgery to repair the hole, took blood thinners for six months and was in hospital for several weeks.  About seven years later, she needed open-heart surgery to repair a leaky heart valve that had been damaged during the heart attack. According to Ceirra, who shared her story with the American Heart Association’s Go Red For Women “Real Women” campaign, the attack had left her heart ""permanently damaged"". The young woman was now wanting to spread her message, and urged other women to ""listen to [their] body"" and ""advocate for [themselves]"". The aim of the British Heart Foundation study was to accurately describe the women’s coronary heart disease symptoms, to develop a deeper understanding of the warning signs. The researchers said: ""The current description of 'typical' cardiac symptoms is based primarily on the experience of white, middle-aged men.” But this ""contributes to misunderstandings in clinicians and lay individuals, leads to inaccurate diagnosis, and causes women to delay seeking treatment"".   They added that in earlier research, they found that between 85 to 90 percent of women reported several different symptoms in the period leading up to a heart attack. The most common symptoms women identified in the month before the heart attack include:  Unusual fatigue (71 per cent) Sleep disturbance (48 per cent) Shortness of breath (42 per cent) Indigestion (39 per cent) Anxiety (36 per cent)  During a heart attack women experienced:  Shortness of breath (58 per cent) Weakness (55 per cent) Unusual fatigue (43 per cent) Cold sweat (39 per cent) Dizziness (39 per cent)  Dr Nancy K. Sweitzer came up with a list of integral factors a person needs to implement into their lives in order to reduce their risk of the potentially life-threatening health condition. She came up with these five lifestyle factors after citing a similar study from Sweden’s Karolinska Institute.  Quit smoking for a 36% risk reduction Eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, reduced-fat dairy, whole grains and fish for a 18% reduction 12% reduction for maintaining a waistline of 37 inches or less for men or less than 35 inches for women 11% reduction for drinking fewer than two alcoholic drinks per day 3% reduction for moderate daily and weekly exercise routines  “It can be overwhelming if people feel they need to make all of these changes at once,” added Dr Sweitzer. “Everyone could look at where they can make the biggest impact on their risk reduction and start with one small change.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/girl-14-who-butterflies-dancing-29164941
"Turkey and Syria earthquake: All the ways you can help after death toll hits 9,500","Over 9,500 people have died and tens of thousands more are injured and missing in Turkey and Syria following the earthquake. Here is how you can help those in needThe devastating earthquakes that hit Turkey and Syria early on Monday were the worst the region had experienced in a century - but how can you help? Over 9,500 people have died and tens of thousands more are injured and missing. Plus there are still daily tremors causing thousands of families' homes to crumble. Rescuers are clawing through rubble with their bare hands despite the sub-zero temperatures and snow storms the region is also battling. People have been plunged into homelessness and everyone is scrambling to rescue people trapped under toppled buildings. In response, charities have set up emergency funds and rescue teams have descended on the region.  To make matters worse, the region where the earthquakes struck is home to significant numbers of Syrian refugees and internally displaced people.    They have already had to flee their homes from nearly 12 years of brutal war.  Some nations have already committed to sending aid, but given the vast scale of destruction, there is still so much more to be done. Many places are setting up donation points across the UK for material goods, but after an earthquake there is no reliable way to get goods to people. Particularly, in Syria where the regime controls the aid flow. By donating to the following charities your money will efficiently get what's required for those in need.

Mum accused of strangling her three children to death 'heard voices in her head',"Lindsay Clancy, 32, from Massachusetts, US, appeared for the first time at Plymouth District Court via Zoom from her hospital bed in a mask and neck brace to hear the charges against herA mum accused of strangling her three children to death ""heard voices in her head"" before her attempted murder-suicide. Lindsay Clancy, 32, from Massachusetts, US, appeared at Plymouth District Court via Zoom from her hospital bed in a mask and neck brace to hear the charges against her yesterday.  The nurse faces three counts of murder and three counts each of strangulation, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. Prosecutors allege she strangled her three children — Cora, 5, Dawson, 3, and Callan, 8 months at their home on January 24 before jumping 20ft from the couple's second-floor window.  Her lawyer, Kevin Reddington, said she was a victim of a medical care that fails mums with “postpartum depression – and even postpartum psychosis.”  He said Mrs Clancy was prescribed drugs, such as Prozac and Seroquel, which are said to include suicidal thoughts as a side effect.   “[Clancy] was … a beautiful person who was destroyed by this medication,” Mr Reddington told the court. He held up a ""wish vase"" of notes which contained hopeful thoughts for her kids which was found near her bed.  Ms Clancy, who did not speak during the proceedings, is now paralysed from the waist down after jumping 20ft from the second- floor window just moments after allegedly murdering her three children.  He told the court: “She can’t walk …she can’t even go to the bathroom.” Her mental health was also “not well at all.” Mrs Clancy told a psychologist she heard a “male voice” telling her to kill her three children and herself before the attempted murder suicide.   In the court hearing she appeared to close her eyes on several occasions as prosecutors alleged that she was “lucid” before the killings.  They also alleged she ""created"" a scenario in her head that saw her husband Patrick leave the family home to pick up take-out. Prosecutors claim this gave her enough time for her alleged murder-suicide.  Mr Clancy returned to the family home after 20 minutes and heard ""silence"" before finding blood and an open window in the upstair's bedroom. He then found his wife on the garden, according to Plymouth Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Sprague.  The dad just seconds later discovered his three children injured in the garage. He quickly called 911 as his screams “seemed to grow louder and louder.” When emergency services arrived to the scene he allegedly yelled “she killed the kids!” Cora and Dawson were pronounced dead that evening with 8-month-old Callan dying three days later.  In Mrs Clancy's notes she said was experiencing a “‘touch of postpartum anxiety” - despite never been diagnosed, according to prosecutors.  Her lawyer claimed she heard voices in her head but her condition had been improving after staying at McClean Hospital earlier that month.  The judge said the mum must not leave the hospital or rehab without permission from the court.  The Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.

Nicola Bulley dive team PULLS OUT of search and is 'glad we didn't find body',"Dive expert Peter Faulding and his team have completed their search of the River Wyre, but have not found missing dog walker Nicola Bulley, with police still without answersA diving expert said Nicola Bulley's family ""need closure"" - but his team ""have done the job we came here to do"" and are now pulling out of the search. The 45-year-old missing mum's partner Paul Ansell was pictured at the search scene on the River Wyre today alongside underwater forensic chief Peter Faulding. Mr Faulding's independent Specialist Group International (SGI) firm were drafted in earlier this week to aid Lancashire Police divers with their high-tech sonar equipment. However, he told the Mirror this afternoon they have completed scouring the area of river from where Nicola's phone was found - and where investigators theorise she likely fell in on January 27. ""We’ve done our job and we’ve cleared the areas that we were tasked with by Lancashire Police and we are happy that there is nothing in that water,"" he said.   However, Mr Faulding emphasised that does not mean Nicola did not go into the water, with different search teams expanding out towards the estuary and sea at Morecambe. On the eve of beginning their efforts on Sunday, he said he was confident if she had fallen in by the bench and drowned, her body would have been snagged within 500 metres. Mr Faulding continued: ""Along with our searches and the police dive searches along that particular stretch of river from the weir up to the caravan park we are 100 percent confident that Nicola is not in that stretch of water. ""Going down river, we’ve searched an area to a bridge. We could not find anything at all in that stretch of water after many long hours.    ""We’re doing this long days, and the police search continues to search the river down to the sea."" Asked how Paul was today, Mr Faulding said he's ""clearly upset"". ""He was stunned, really. He just wants to know where his partner is. He’s an upset man,"" he added. ""The family just wanted to come up and talk to me and see progress and how we’d done and Paul wanted to go up to the bench again to see the area.  ""I walked up with Paul and explained to him this is where we’ve searched and I told Paul that we’d cleared from the weir up to about another mile up river, a long way up the river."" He said Nicola's family was ""grateful"" for the work SGI did - which they offered completely free of charge - but ""it's difficult"". ""They just want to know where Nicola is. They are all upset…they haven’t got any answers and no one’s got any answers to give them.  ""All I can say, we’ve given them the answers they need to know from the river, I suppose. I’m glad we never found Nicola, we got no body and that’s good. If she’s alive, I don't know. ""It would be nice for the family to get some closure, some form of closure somehow.""  Mr Faulding said he now plans to go back home to Surrey tomorrow. ""I’m going home tomorrow, I’ve only had three hours sleep last night, I’m extremely tired,"" he continued. He explained it is one of the most ""baffling"" cases he's ever dealt with. ""This has totally, totally blown my mind out, really. It’s really baffling,"" he said.

"Hero boy, 17, saves man and his dog after car plummets off bridge into icy lake","Thomas Lee fell with his Jeep off the Highway 71 bridge on East Okoboji Lake, Dickinson County in Iowa, US, but luckily, Jow Salmon and others ran to the rescue for him and his dogA 17-year-old boy has rescued a man after the car he was driving in with his dog plummeted off a bridge and broke through the icy surface of a lake. The incident took place in Iowa as the north and western parts of the country are frozen by an arctic blast that has brought dangerously frigid temperatures over the past week. Thomas Lee, 83, and his dog Cooper, 6, were trapped inside the Jeep after Lee drove it off the Highway 71 bridge on East Okoboji Lake, Dickinson County, US, at around 3pm (9pm GMT) on Saturday, February 4. Lucky for them, teenager Joe Salmon was ice fishing nearby along with his mother, while watching snowmobile races. Salmon and a few other people ran to the rescue of Lee and his dog, Cooper, and within a few minutes managed to drag them both to safety. Lee, who was heading to his son-in-law's fishing shack at the time, said: ""I want to thank the people who helped and the store that took the dog in and dried him off."" Read More
  Lee, who was heading to his son-in-law's fishing shack at the time, said: ""I want to thank the people who helped and the store that took the dog in and dried him off."" Corey McConnell, 30; Kody Harrelson, 26; Cody Chester, 27; and Chris Parks, 27; also helped pull the man and dog to safety. It is estimated the lake is 3-4 feet deep at the location where the Jeep broke through, and the car was near the bottom by the time help arrived. Lee appeared to be in shock as Salmon and the four others told him to get out of the car. Salmon shattered the glass at the rear of the car and scooped the dog out first. By that time, the water was already up to the driver's waist.  Salmon, a wrestler, football player and track runner, later told Des Moines Register : ""I took one step and [the water] went to about my chest.  ""I got on the bumper of the rear and tried opening the back door, but all the windows were locked, but one guy gave me a knife and I hit the back glass a couple of times."" He explained that Lee's foot was stuck between the seat and the centre console, so he had to pull the console up to release him. Lee wasn't injured but was transported to Lakes Regional Healthcare for observation.  Salmon was examined by the ambulance crew for minor cuts from the glass and received dry clothes from the Okoboji Store. Following the incident, the boy went back to fishing and even caught two. He said: ""I'm happy that he was OK and the dog was OK. It was just crazy at the time. I've never done anything like that."" During the rescue, Salmon lost his shoes in the water. A tweet from the Okoboji High School boys' track team tried to get Nike to replace the shoes. Nike hasn't chimed in yet, but ESPN's Marty Smith pledged to send a pair of Jordans. Salmon also received an offer from the Track Guy Foundation. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/hero-boy-17-saves-man-29164666
FedEx truck driver dies after train smashes into vehicle and shreds it to pieces,"Patrick Metz, 34, died instantly after the FedEx semi-truck he was driving went onto the tracks and was torn apart by a passing Amtrak passenger train in Pleasant Hill, Missouri, USA man has been killed after the truck he was driving crashed into a train and was shredded to pieces in a horrific accident. Patrick Metz, 34, died instantly after failing to stop the FedEx truck he was driving at a stop sign and an Amtrak passenger train crashed on it from the driver's side, authorities said.  He was pronounced dead at the scene. The accident occurred at 10.25am local time (4.25pm UK) on Tuesday, on Hereford Road in rural Pleasant Hill, Missouri, US. Emergency agencies rushed to the scene to find the truck torn apart.  Footage from the location shows its wreckage on the rails and the train stopped on the tracks. No injuries were reported from any passengers or staff on the train.   An alert from the train operator, Amtrak, confirmed that the Lincoln Service Missouri River Runner Train 318 had stopped east of Lee’s Summit due to an ""incident"" Tuesday Morning. That train left Union Station in Kansas City on its way to St. Louis and Chicago on Tuesday morning. It was reported that 29 passengers were on board the train at the time, and they were subsequently taken off the train and loaded on buses towards Chicago. They said they ""did not feel much, but felt the train come to a sudden stop"" and that the Amtrak crew ""did an amazing job keeping everyone calm,"" KMBC reported.   ""These incidents can affect everyone involved—those who are injured or die and their families, our train crews, and our passengers,"" Amtrak said in a statement to Fox News.  ""They also serve as critical reminders about the importance of obeying the law and of exercising extreme caution around railroad tracks and crossings."" An investigation to determine the circumstances that led to the crash is ongoing, however, Missouri State Highway Patrol said in a report that Metz didn't stop at a stop sign and attempted to cross the tracks. Damage to the train was relatively minimal and it should still be able to function properly, authorities said.  ""We extend our deepest condolences to the family and friends of those involved in this accident,"" FedEx said in a statement. ""Safety is our highest priority, and we are cooperating fully with the investigating authorities at this time."" At least one other accident has been reported at this crossing in 1999, a non-fatal crash between a train and a truck stopped at the crossing.

"Ex-MP Jared O'Mara GUILTY of fraud after claiming £30,000 to fund cocaine lifestyle","The judge said O'Mara had been accused of trying to fraudulently claim up to £30,000 in taxpayers' money to fund an ""extravagant lifestyle - drink, cigarettes and, above all, cocaine""Former MP Jared O'Mara has been found guilty of six counts of expenses fraud. O'Mara, 41, who defeated Nick Clegg to represent Sheffield Hallam from 2017 to 2019, is accused of submitting fraudulent invoices totalling more than £28,000 to the Parliament's Expenses watchdog, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa). He was convicted on Wednesday of six counts of fraud by false representation. The jury cleared him of two other fraud charges. Co-defendant Gareth Arnold was found guilty of three out of six fraud charges, and a third defendant, John Woodliff, was found not guilty of one offence of fraud. O'Mara and Arnold will be sentenced at the same court on Thursday. Judge Tom Bayliss KC finished summing up the evidence to jurors at Leeds Crown Court yesterday morning before they retired to start their deliberations. The judge said the prosecution's case is that O'Mara tried to fraudulently claim up to £30,000 in taxpayers' money to fund an ""extravagant lifestyle - drink, cigarettes and, above all, cocaine"". O'Mara is accused of making four bogus claims to Ipsa between June and August 2019 from a ""fictitious"" organisation called Confident About Autism South Yorkshire, which jurors heard referred to his friend John Woodliff, and submitting two invoices from another friend, Gareth Arnold, for media and PR work that prosecutors say was never carried out.   It is also claimed that O'Mara submitted a false contract of employment for Woodliff, ""pretending"" he worked as a constituency support officer. O'Mara was charged with eight counts of fraud by false representation, with Arnold jointly charged with six of the offences and Woodliff jointly charged with one. Arnold - the only one of the three defendants to give evidence during the trial - told the court he ""absolutely"" did the work on both invoices relating to him, and that O'Mara would regularly call him for ""ad hoc"" help with media work before putting him on the payroll as chief of staff in June 2019. Leeds Crown Court was told Ipsa - the organisation set up after the expenses scandal to regulate MPs' staffing and business costs - did not pay out any of the claims due to a lack of evidence that any of the work was done.  Jurors were told O'Mara had a ""dysfunctional"" office and sacked most of his staff ""overnight"" in around April 2019. A former case worker, Kevin Gregory-Coyne, said O'Mara went to his constituency office ""once or twice"" in six months and once attended a staff meeting while apparently ""on some sort of substance"".  O'Mara won Sheffield Hallam for Labour from former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Nick Clegg in 2017 but later left the party after a series of controversies.   He stayed in office as an independent MP but did not contest the 2019 general election.  O'Mara, of Walker Close, Sheffield; Arnold, of School Lane, Dronfield, Derbyshire; and Woodliff, of Hesley Road, Shiregreen, Sheffield, denied all charges.

"Woman shares how she cut her energy bill by £1,000 - and urges others to do vital check","The woman shared her story with the Extreme and Bargains Facebook group as she thought it might help someone else who was struggling with the same problemOne woman has shared how she managed to get her energy bill down by nearly £1,000. The woman told the Extreme Couponing and Bargains Facebook group that she managed to reduce her bill down from £1,550.75 to £593.53.  It was the first time she posted to the Facebook group of two million members and said she wanted to share her story as she thought it might help someone else struggling with the same problem.  She told the group that she was currently with E.on energy for both her gas and electricity and a direct debit set up.  She added: ""To be honest, I just left my account to it.""  The Facebook user checked her energy account and saw that her bill was showing around £1,229.  Two weeks later she checked again and the price had skyrocketed by £300 and her account was showing her a bill for around £1,550.  The E.on account said the readings had come from the woman's smart meter however after checking her gas meter, the poster found that E.on had overestimated her gas bill by over 900 units.  The E.on customer looked into the issue and found that her standing charge was much higher than the maximum that can be charged by Ofgem.  In the post, she wrote: ""I emailed them because when I looked into it their standing charges and charges per kw were waaay higher than the maximum that Ofgem shows.  ""I know nothing about this I just googled it and it says what the maximum charges should be for gas and electric.""  The energy regulator Ofgem says the standing charge has been capped at 46p for electricity and 28p for gas for customers on ""default tariffs"" and paying by direct debit. Although she did not share what her standing charges were, she claim the energy firm was adding daily charges of £11 even when she was not at her property.  She also threatened to contact the energy ombudsmen about the situation.  After this, she received the good news that her bill was to be reduced.  She said: ""I’ve just got my new bill generated and it’s gone from £1550.75 to £593.53. So if you think your bill is wrong, it probably is! That’s nearly £1,000 difference - I hope this helps someone."" Her Facebook post has currently received nearly 3,000 likes and has garnered 756 comments.   A large number of the comments were from others who had been through the same experience, some asked for help as they were currently going through the same and others thanked her for sharing.  One Facebook user commented: ""Well done you, that’s amazing, but if you’d just left it, look how much more you would have paid. ""It just goes to show that we all need to be aware of the prices that we are paying thankyou!""  One wrote: ""Thank you I was also discussing this matter with my husband. We have been away and my smart meter showed the weekly usage which did not make sense, how could it be so much when we’ve not been in the property? So I said this is bloody fraud."" Another added: ""I think the more people that know about this the better!! Thank you."" If you have a complaint with an energy company your local ombudsman may be able to help you with advice.

Wilko makes huge change to over 400 UK stores - and it's great news for shoppers,"Wilk had been trialling out click and collect across half of its stores - but now it has confirmed that the service will become a permanent feature in all its 400 UK sitesWilko is rolling out its click and collect service across all its stores in the UK.   The service is free to use and allows customers to order products online before picking them up in stores.  Some items will be ready to collect within just three hours and there is no minimum spend to use click and collect. The introduction of the service comes after a successful trial involving around half of Wilko stores. It will now be made available across all remaining stores as part of this full rollout. Once you've placed an order, you will have seven days to collect your goods. If you don't collect within this time, Wilko will refund you.  Click and collect is cheaper than ordering items for home delivery from Wilko. Wilko currently charges £4.95 for standard delivery and £7.96 for next day. Wilko digital director, Ben Exall said: “This is an exciting addition to wilko.com and offers customers more flexibility than ever when it comes to shopping with us. “We’re proud to have already rolled this out across over half of our stores nationwide via two initial trials and, thanks to fantastic customer demand and feedback, we’re thrilled to be bringing click and collect to over 400 locations nationwide.”   It comes after Wilko announced it is reducing the range of toys it sells in stores as it shifts its focus back to its “heritage” as a household and garden retailer.  Wilko however has offered a bit of reassurance to its toy suppliers as it said it would continue to offer “seasonal/outdoor toys” relevant to the time of year. Wilko also said it would continue to offer customers a choice of ""selected toys"" on its website. In a statement shared with Mirror Money, Wilko said: “To further focus on the household and garden products that our customers come to us for most often, we’re reducing our range of toys instore. “However, we’ll still be providing seasonal toy products such as paddling pools and Christmas presents to help our customers find fun things to enjoy together during holiday periods.” Founded as a hardware store in 1930, Wilko employs around 16,000 people and trades across the UK from around 400 stores. Earlier this month, the retailer managed to secure a £40million funding lifeline from the owner of Home Base and Cath Kidston Hilco UK.

Paperchase shoppers warned to spend vouchers within DAYS after chain's collapse,"Paperchase shoppers have been advised to use up their gift cards as soon as possible, with February 14 being the last day they’ll remain valid - here is everything you need to knowPaperchase shoppers have only days left to spend any vouchers they have before they become worthless. The stationery chain collapsed into administration for the second time last month. Tesco swooped in to purchase the Paperchase brand and intellectual property - but the buyout didn’t include its stores.  It means 106 Paperchase sites are at risk of closure, with many stores already hosting sales with “at least 20% off” goods. Paperchase shoppers have also been advised to use up their gift cards as soon as possible, with February 14 being the last day they’ll remain valid.  When a business goes bust, the administrators can choose to stop accepting gift cards at any time. Paperchase has appointed insolvency firm Begbies Traynor as administrators. A statement from Begbies Traynor said: ""On January 31 2023 Mark Fry, Kirstie Provan and Gary Shankland, of Begbies Traynor, were appointed as Joint Administrators of Aspen Phoenix Newco Limited, which trades as Paperchase. ""Unfortunately, despite a comprehensive sales process, no viable offers were received for the Company, or its business and assets, on a going concern basis. ""However, this sale reflects the interest in the well-known and established brand and will enable the brand to continue in Tesco stores across the UK.""   Gift cards - your rights  If a business goes bust and you can't use your voucher, you can register a claim with the administrators. However, you may not get your cash back, or only a portion of the voucher value back. This is because you could well be in a long list of many creditors the company owes money to. If the voucher value was for more than £100 and it was purchased with a credit card, you might be able to claim the money back under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 puts both your credit card company and the retailer at joint liability if something goes wrong. If the voucher was paid for with a debit card or was worth less than £100 and paid for with a credit card, you might be able to use Chargeback. Sadly, this isn't enshrine in law like Section 75 - but the Law Commission says card providers will usually honour it when companies go into administration. If the voucher was a gift, then you'd need to ask the person who bought it for you to claim the money back. Read More

Nationwide slashing up to 450 jobs as part of huge business shake-up,"The Nationwide Building Society spokesperson said the job losses would enable the building society to ""increase investment in the value and service we provide our members""Nationwide Building Society is set to axe hundreds of jobs as part of a shake-up of its business. A high street building society spokesperson said the cuts are part of a move to ""streamline"" non-member facing roles. Nationwide has said it has ""worked hard"" to keep the number of affected roles ""to a minimum"" but it expects around 450 jobs to be cut. The statement added: ""Our strategy is to give members greater value, better products and a distinctive customer experience,"" ""To do this our systems and operations must be best in class and we need to be more agile and efficient.""  The Nationwide spokesperson said the job losses would enable the building society to ""increase investment in the value and service we provide our members"". It also said it will be providing the ""right support"" for people affected by the cuts. The building society has not confirmed exactly which ""non-member facing"" roles will be affected by the cuts.  Nationwide's head office is based in Swindon and the group has administration centres based in Northhampton, Bournemouth, and Dunfermline.  It also has a number of call centres across the UK.   Nationwide has over 17,000 employees across all areas and has around 15million customers.  Like other banks and building societies, Nationwide has said it will be closing branches in the future. However, it has been confirmed that there is only one branch closure currently planned for the year ahead.  This is the Portman Square branch, based in Marylebone, London, which will close its doors on February 23. Aside from this branch closure, Nationwide are actually one of the only UK banks that have pledged to keep their branches open for the foreseeable future.  The building society originally promised to keep their branches open until January 2023, however, this date has now been extended until 2024.   Nationwide's CEO Debbie Crosbie said in June last year, the decision to do this was to help their members through the cost of living crisis. Even with this promise, customers have seen a handful of closures over the last year.  Although a Nationwide spokesperson said that ""sustainability"" was the reason behind some of these closures and it considered the ""interest of their wider membership"" on its decision to keep open a branch. Currently Nationwide currently has around 625 branches in operation across the UK which makes it the third largest bank in terms of their branches network. Mirror Money has contacted Nationwide Building Society directly for comment on this story. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/breaking-nationwide-slashing-up-450-29166197
House of Fraser closing shops across UK – is your nearest branch shutting for good?,"House of Fraser was saved from collapse by Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley back in 2018 which saved the department store chain's 59 stores however only 30 sites now remainHouse of Fraser is set to close more stores across the UK as it continues to battle with declining sales. The high street department store is expected to close its Cardiff site after it recently launched a major clearance sale. The store, located inside the Howells Building, is currently displaying “closing down – extra 20% off” signs as well as selling store furniture, mannequins, and store decorations. House of Fraser, which opened on St Mary Street as Howells in 1867, will shut in March according to signs outside the building. The departure from the Welsh capital will see the retailer close its last remaining store in Wales.  The group's Birmingham site is also expected to be at risk of closure after it was converted into an outlet store. The top three floors of the Birmingham Corporation Street site have now been closed and all prices are being discounted by a further 20% at the tills. According to reports by BirminghamLive, there are a series of portable heaters in use to keep the air warm on the lower floors and the message is that ""all stock must go"".  No official announcements have been made by House of Fraser.  In recent months the department store has closed a number of stores, including in Leeds and Huddersfield with its High Wycombe branch also earmarked for closure. Fraser Group, which owns House of Fraser, has also temporarily closed its Norwich store which it plans to reopen in autumn of this year following its refurbishment. In December last year, Fraser Group agreed to buy a string of fashion brands from the leisurewear retailer JD Sports. These included the Tessuti, Scotts, Choice, Giulio and Cricket brands.  House of Fraser was saved from collapse by Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley back in 2018 in a £90m pre-pack administration deal which saved the chain's 59 stores and 17,000 workers.  After the purchase, the new House of Fraser owner said he wanted to turn the 174-year-old retailer into the “Harrods of the high street”. However, since then, the department store has become well known for its prolonged sales and numerous store closures with Mike Ashley admitting to Forbes in 2019 that buying the department store was a ""mistake"".  House of Fraser currently has around 30 sites left in the UK which is almost half what it had when it was saved. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/house-fraser-closing-shops-across-29163490

In the video, Alex alleged to know 'what TK Maxx codes actually mean', asking followers to 'thank me later'. The clip shows Alex out shopping at TK Maxx, hunting down specific codes and pointing out what she says they mean.    The TikToker starts off by picking up a product with the number '1' on it, which she says is produced by TK Maxx themselves. As claimed by Alex, items labelled with the number '2' are 'genuine unsold stock', while those bearing a number '7' are products which have been 'packed away from a previous year'. The video wraps up with Alex urging her followers to keep their eyes peeled for products labelled with a '2' and '7' if they want to bag themselves the best possible deals.

"Archie Battersbee died in prank gone wrong, coroner says as tragic WhatsApp messages revealed","A forensic analysis of the 12-year-old’s mobile phone uncovered a number of messages in which he refers to experiencing low mood but he ended up dying 'during a prank or experiment that went wrong'Tragic schoolboy Archie Battersbee died “inadvertently during a prank or experiment that went wrong”, a coroner has concluded. Recording his death as an accident, senior coroner Lincoln Brookes said that although there was evidence of Archie experiencing low mood in the last 12 months of his life, there was no sign he intended to harm himself on the day he was injured. Archie was found unconscious with a ligature around his neck at his home in Southend, Essex, on April 7 last year. He died four months later in hospital after his parents lost a legal battle with medics over the withdrawal of his life support. Although his family initially feared he could have taken part in a social media ‘blackout challenge’, the inquest heard police found no evidence to support this.   Officers discovered Archie was in Whatsapp groups called “Help” and “I’m depressed”, the court heard. A forensic analysis of the 12-year-old’s mobile phone also uncovered a number of messages dating back to 2021 in which he refers to experiencing low mood. In a Whatsapp exchange with his mum Hollie Dance last year, he told her: “Do you know how sometimes I think about self harm. I bet you didn’t. That’s how harsh my depression is. “Sometimes I want to end it and I think about how many people I would let down.” He later added “I just want to let go” and “just give up everything”.  In a Whatsapp group chat in February, he told friends he rated his physical appearance as one out of ten. He added: “That’s why I’m so depressed all the time but I have tried and thought about killing myself.” However DS Tiffany Gore, who analysed the phone, noted that there was no evidence of a suicide note and he had been looking ahead and browsing online for a new coat on the day on the day he was injured. “There wasn’t evidence he was in a low mood on that day,” she told the court. Her colleague DI Sarah Weeks, who concluded the death was non-suspicious, added that “it may not be possible to establish what motivated Archie”.  “On the day of the incident Archie was looking forward,” she said.  “He was looking forward to his first MMA fight and had chosen the music for his entrance. ""He was looking to buy a coat.” In a statement read to the court by the coroner, Archie's older half brother Thomas Summers described Archie as a ""joker"" and said he was looking forward to his first MMA fight in a few weeks. ""Archie had never said anything to me that caused me concern for his emotional well-being,” he said. “I do not believe Archie would have intentionally harmed himself in any way when just a few hours before he was looking to buy a coat.”  Archie’s half sister Lauren Summers also said she could not recall ""any signs or indications of Archie being in a low mood or displaying unusual behaviour"". Summarising his findings, the coroner said that although there was evidence of previous periods of low mood, Archie was presenting like the “happy go lucky cheeky chappy” his family described on the days preceding the incident. He said the incident with a ligature may well have been a “case of curiosity” after he was seen playing a 'lasso' game a day earlier. Archie’s cause of death was recorded as 1A catastrophic hypoxic ischemic brain injury, secondary to strangulation. Speaking outside the coroner’s court in Chelmsford, Essex, his tearful mum said she thinks the coroner reached the “right outcome”. “It has given us some of the answers, not all,” she said. “I just think that it’s time to allow us as a family to grieve.” Although the coroner did not conclude Archie’s death was related to a 'blackout challenge', she was glad that she had raised awareness of the dangers for other parents.

President Zelensky’s 'huge ask' for fighter jets could cause problems for UK Government,"The British Government faces problems with President Zelensky's demands for fighter jets after giving him Challenger tanks in the fight against Vladimir PutinPresident Zelensky’s fighter jet demands may cause problems for the British government. The Challenger tanks we gave him were a step change, opening up the way for other countries to follow. But the jets request is a huge ask. We have around 100 Typhoon fighter jets and a further 27 brand new and hugely expensive F-35B fighter jets for our aircraft carriers, the latter costing around £100 million each, so we are not about to hand those over. The RAF is currently putting out of service around 20 early variant Typhoons which whilst they are brilliant air-to-air fighters, and are available, don’t easily adapt to air-to-ground bombing runs.    We are unlikely to give Ukraine machines that we still need, but those that we don’t need are not appropriate.  Zelensky’s pilots want jets like the US F-18 or F-16 or French Raphael Mirages.They are ideal air-to-ground bombers and can fight air-to-air. There are plenty of F-16s in the US, Belgium and Holland, whilst F-18s are in large numbers in the US and Spain.  The best way to help Ukraine is to give them jets that are good air-to-air and air-to-ground so they can control airspace and dominate ground – perhaps Crimea – in a future offensive. Crucially, it takes about nine months to pull a Ukrainian pilot away from flying Soviet-era MiG-29 fighters to teach him or her to fly a new jet. There is a race on to make this happen. When it does it needs to be with jets that can be supplied in volume. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/president-zelenskys-huge-ask-fighter-29169835
Nicola Bulley could have used path with no CCTV as friend wants abandoned house searched,"Mother of two Nicola Bulley, 45, disappeared on January 27 from a footpath near the River Wye which police believe she fell in - although they admit she may have left via a pathPolice searching for missing Nicola Bulley say she could have left the area by the only path not covered by CCTV, as the search for the mum continues. Officers have trawled through footage covering several pathways and fields near the area of the River Wye she was last reported seen on January 27. On the 13th day of the search Nicola’s partner Paul Ansell visited the area where he met with police and dive expert Peter Faulding. As the investigation goes on police still believe she most likely fell in the deep waters of the river, but say it is a “possibility” she left the area via the only path not covered by cameras. In another development, close personal friend Tilly Ann urged officers to look in a nearby abandoned house close to the river.   Tilly wrote on Facebook: ""The abandoned house and outbuildings etc have not yet been searched as it is not currently a crime investigation!"" In the latest update Lancashire Police said: “Our enquiries now focus on the river path which leads from the fields back to Garstang Road. “For that we need drivers and cyclists who travelled that way on the morning of January 27 to make contact. “We have already done a lot of work around this, but every piece of footage helps us build up a picture of movements on that morning.  “We will be making contact with drivers, who we believe were travelling down Garstang Road that morning via letter.  ""If you receive one of these letters and have dashcam footage, we would urge you to make contact so that a member of the enquiry team can make contact and review your footage to establish whether it assists. We would ask that only drivers that do have dashcam footage reply to this request. “Today we have been joined by a search team from Specialist Group International (SGI) who are assisting us with the search of the river, and we are grateful to them for their help. “We are also grateful to all the members of the public who have come out to search and we would remind people not to put themselves at risk and to stick to public land.”  The 45-year-old vanished on January 27 after dropping off her two children at school in St Michael's, Lancashire, before taking family dog Willow for a walk on a nearby trail. However, her phone was later found on a bench, with the springer spaniel wandering nearby without her harness. Detective Supt Rebecca Smith added: “The team working on this investigation are completely dedicated and determined to find Nicola.  “As a mother myself, I can’t even begin to imagine what her two children are going through. “Please be reassured our sole focus is Nicola and that we are doing everything we can to find her. “It is not possible to provide every piece of information to the public because to do so would detract from the investigation, but I’d like to thank everyone who has assisted us so far and for the support provided to Nicola’s family at this extremely difficult time. They are being supported and updated throughout.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nicola-bulley-could-used-path-29169230
Epsom College head and husband 'hosted dinner for pals hours before murder-suicide',"A friend said Emma Pattison, 45, and her husband George, 39, held an ""intimate"" dinner party at their home, with one friend saying there were no signs of being upset Epsom College headteacher Emma Pattison and her husband had a last supper with pals hours before their deaths.  Emma Pattison, 45, her daughter Lettie and her husband George, 39, were all found dead at their home within the private school's grounds in Surrey, in the early hours of Sunday morning. Surrey Police confirmed a firearm was found at the scene and believe George Pattison shot his wife and daughter before killing himself.  A friend has now described how nothing seemed ""unusual"" during the couple's supper with friends hours before the bloody rampage in the college ground. They said the couple seemed gave no sign of being upset during a dinner party they held on the Saturday night. The pal said: ""On Saturday night they threw a dinner party. It was quite an intimate affair and literally turned out to be their last supper.   “Nothing unusual happened. There were no arguments, no indication he would go on to do something so horrific a short time later"", reports The Sun. Moments before the unspeakable tragedy, Emma, 45, is reported to have phoned her sister Deborah Kirk. It's now understood that Emma's sister rushed to the scene after the distress call. In a since-deleted student podcast, Ms Pattison spoke of how recent months in her new role had seen big changes for her family.  ""In terms of transition it’s been a really big change for my family. We’ve moved house - we’ve bought a dog. ""I’ve got a new job, my husband has got a new job, that wasn’t meant to happen but it did and my daughter has started a new school so there’s been a lot of change for us as a family.” The head said she ""hadn't looked back"" since entering into teaching and told the student-presented podcast ""working with you people keeps you young, they keep you energised"". ""I am absolutely loving my time here so far,"" Mrs Pattison added. ""It's been very busy but absolutely wonderful. The college have been so supportive and everyone has been very, very welcoming.""  In May 2016, Mr Pattison had called police saying he had been assaulted at their home, claiming his wife had slapped him around the face. He then made a second call asking police not to visit and said he had overreached - however police did attend and arrested Mrs Pattison on suspicion of common assault. She was questioned and later released without charge. Police were reportedly told the couple were suffering with marriage problems at the time and Mrs Pattison's job as a deputy headteacher of an independent school in Leatherhead had caused issues.  Surrey Police had also visited the family home in Epsom three days before the killings after Mr Pattison notified them of a change of address in relation to his shotgun licence. The Force has now made a self-referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct due to the short period of tine between their visit and the three deaths.

President Zelensky vows Ukraine's forces will free nation from Russia's barbaric grip,"In a rousing speech to a packed Westminster Hall in London, Volodymyr Zelensky said his forces will free Ukraine - but asked for Britain's help in his cause against Putin Volodymyr Zelensky has vowed his Ukrainian forces would eventually free the war-ravaged nation from Russia ’s barbaric grip.   But he pleaded with Britain to help his country’s cause against dictator Vladimir Putin by urgently providing him with fighter jets.  As Moscow’s bombs continued to batter innocent Ukrainian ­civilians, the President gave a rousing speech to a packed Westminster Hall in London.  He said: “I appeal to you and the world with simple and yet most ­important words… combat aircraft for Ukraine, wings for freedom.”  Referring to then-Prince Charles training as a Royal Navy helicopter pilot in the 70s, Mr Zelensky added: “In Britain, the King is an air force pilot and in Ukraine today, every air force pilot is a king.   ""We will always come out on top of evil, this lies at the core of our, but also your, traditions. We know freedom will win, we know Russia will lose. “And we know the victory will change the world, a change it has long needed. The United Kingdom is marching with us towards the most ­important victory of our lifetime.  “A victory over the very idea of the war.” Mr Zelensky told ministers and MPs, including Boris Johnson, he was “thanking all of you in advance for powerful English planes”.  But Russia warned of ­“military and ­political consequences for the world” that would be on London’s conscience if Britain gave Ukraine fighter jets.   Mr Zelensky’s plea piled pressure on Rishi Sunak to send planes. No10 later said Defence Secretary Ben Wallace had been asked to explore what aircraft the UK could provide in the light of the heartfelt appeal.  The PM has so far resisted, claiming it would take too long to train pilots on the RAF’s F-35 ­Lightning II and Typhoon aircraft. But he revealed yesterday the UK would begin training Ukrainian pilots to fly ­“sophisticated NATO-standard fighter jets”. Mr Sunak’s spokesman added: “This is a long-term solution rather than a ­short-term capability, which is what Ukraine needs most now.” After Mr Zelensky’s speech, he presented Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle with a Ukrainian airman’s helmet.  The ­President had arrived at ­Stansted airport on an RAF C17 ­Globemaster ­transport plane yesterday morning. Wearing his ­trademark combat outfit, he met Mr Sunak on the tarmac. Mr Zelensky was driven around in an armoured BMW 7 Series as part of a 12-vehicle convoy. He last night visited Lulworth Camp in Dorset, where Ukrainian troops are training to use ­Challenger 2 tanks that will be sent to help their forces. Mr Zelensky, who arrived by ­helicopter with Mr Sunak, told the troops: “Your courage is inspiring. We will be there until you are victorious.” At a press conference Mr Zelensky melted the heart of a Ukrainian reporter who asked him for a hug. He ignored security protocol and left his podium to embrace her. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/president-zelensky-vows-ukraines-forces-29169634
Disabled mum's 17-year fight with 'poisonous' black mould which spreads 'like wildfire',"Mum-of-four Alexandra Osei Bonsu, who is severely disabled, claims she has been ignored by Haringey Council, who say they are dismayed and appalled by the family's living conditionsA disabled mum of four says the potentially poisonous black mould that has covered nearly every inch of her flat spreads like wildfire as soon as she clears it. The dangerous grime has covered the ceiling, walls and carpets of Alexandra Osei Bonsu’s home in Haringey, north London for the past 17 years. It has been there for nearly two decades and no amount of clearing can get rid of it.  Things have got so bad it now cakes her children's clothes, MyLondon report.  The problem has intensified in recent months with thick dark spores covering their hands in the powdery black substance.   “Every time we try and go to sleep we really find it hard to breathe, me and my daughter are asthmatic,” she said. “I lifted up the bed and when I saw the carpet it was covered in mould. My daughter tried to get her pyjamas out and they were covered in mould.” Alexandra is a severely disabled mum of four children, two of whom have additional needs. Living with the mould has had a substantial impact on the family’s health and she fears what the long-term implications might be. Haringey council says they are dismayed and appalled to see the conditions this family are living in. As the property is overcrowded, Alexandra has had to sleep sitting in a chair so that her children can have a bedroom.   This has caused her incredible discomfort and means on occasions she has to walk with a crutch. Her concerns were confirmed by an independent occupational therapist who assessed the home and deemed it inappropriate for their needs in a report. This was submitted to Haringey Council. However, there was a lack of action from her landlord. Alexandra has been constantly contacting the council, which she claims has been increasingly unresponsive.  In January 2022 she sent pictures of the mould and received no response, similar emails in May and June were also ignored. “I’m treated like the invisible tenant,” she added, “They said were going to get a surveyor out, but that never happened. I've been calling them nonstop and they’re telling me nothing. I called them the other day and they said ‘there's nothing on the system’.”  Alexandra claims a council-appointed surveyor from the company assessed the mould and said it would require around £10,000-worth of work to get rid of or they would have to leave the property. However, after this visit, no action was taken. Outside the property, there was another safety issue which was only resolved after an incident took place. “ To get into my flat you had to go up a set of stairs,” she continued, “It was really bad walking up and down so they got a stair lift. But it broke because of my autistic children and they said they wouldn't replace it. So I asked if they could please remove it.” She was concerned one of her children would hurt themselves on the stairlift because being autistic meant they were less aware of their surroundings.    But her pleas to the housing provider fell on deaf ears. After her son fell down the stairs suffering injuries to his head, they removed it two months later. In total, it stayed there broken for two years. Dana Carlin, Haringey's cabinet member for housing services, private renters and planning, responded to the issues raised by apologising to the family. She said: “I am dismayed and appalled to see the conditions this family are living in. ""We are working closely with Ms Osei Bonsu to provide urgent suitable alternative accommodation whilst we address the issues in her home.  ""Haringey is committed to a zero-tolerance approach to damp and mould in our properties and we are reviewing our processes to understand how we did not identify and address the issues earlier. ""We have also streamlined our reporting process to ensure all reported damp and mould is correctly signposted to the relevant service. I would like to offer my sincere apologies to Alexandra Osei Bonsu and her family.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/disabled-mums-17-year-fight-29168464
Sweet moment President Zelensky snubs security protocol to give Ukrainian reporter a hug,"During his surprise visit to the UK President Volodymyr Zelensky ignored security rules to give a huge to a Ukrainian reporter, which she later told the Mirror was 'the best'President Volodymyr Zelensky melted hearts as he ignored security protocols to give a hug to a plaintive Ukrainian news reporter. Natalia Goncharova, from Kyiv, who grilled Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on fighter jets and Russian money laundering without getting a good answer, got the best answer she could from her own leader. The smiling Ukrainian premier didn't think twice about pacing away from his podium and giving Natalia a hug after she asked him for one. Asked if it was a good hug Natalia, from Kyiv, told The Mirror: “The best.” During the visit Ukraine's leader said he would be ""intensifying our diplomacy"" to pave the way for the UK to give Typhoon jets to Kyiv, suggesting the decision was not totally dependent on London.   President Zelensky, speaking through a translator at a joint press conference, said: ""When it comes to Typhoons, not everything depends just on the decision of Great Britain. ""I will be working in that direction because this is how we have been able to change many things. ""We are intensifying our diplomacy and I do believe within a day we will be able to meet with a dozen EU leaders and then we will go back home. ""All of these conversations, they have to take place quickly.""  Responding to the Prime Minister saying how long it takes to train a Typhoon fighter pilot from scratch, Mr Zelensky said: ""I didn't even know it takes three years to train a pilot like that. ""Come on, we will be sending you pilots who have already trained for two and a half-years.""  After the speech, ex-PM Boris Johnson Mr Johnson piled pressure on No10 by putting a statement shortly after the speech saying the UK should give Ukraine more military supplies.  The ex-PM said: ""It is time to give the Ukrainians the extra equipment they need to defeat Putin and to restore peace to Ukraine.  ""That means longer range missiles and artillery. It means more tanks. It means planes. ""We have more than 100 Typhoon jets. We have more than 100 Challenger 2 tanks. ""The best single use for any of these items is to deploy them now for the protection of the Ukrainians - not least because that is how we guarantee our own long-term security."" The visit is only Mr Zelensky's second outside Ukraine since the war began after he made a whirlwind trip to the United States in December. Rishi Sunak said of his Ukrainian counterpart: “President Zelensky’s visit to the UK is a testament to his country’s courage, determination and fight, and a testament to the unbreakable friendship between our two countries.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/sweet-moment-president-zelensky-snubs-29169161
Police spark anger by calling tragic family 'murder-suicide' an 'isolated incident',"Emma Pattison, 45, her daughter Lettie, 7, and her husband George, 39, were all found dead at their home within the private school's grounds in Surrey, in the early hours of Sunday morning.Police have sparked fury for calling the Epsom 'murder-suicide' an 'isolated incident'. Emma Pattison, 45, her daughter Lettie, 7, and her husband George, 39, were all found dead at their home within the private school's grounds in Surrey, in the early hours of Sunday morning. Surrey Police confirmed a firearm was found at the scene and believe George Pattison shot his wife and daughter before killing himself. The police confirmed that a firearm had been found at the scene and had been recovered by officers.  It was licensed and registered to Mr Pattinson, although causes of death will not be confirmed until after post-mortem examinations have been completed. However, the police force came under criticism in a statement that said the murder-suicide was an “isolated incident”, with many saying that there was currently an “epidemic” in male violence towards women, reports MyLondon.   Sharing a BBC news article, one journalist wrote: ""Every woman I spoke to yesterday knew this would be the reason Emma and Lettie Pattison are gone.  ""Police call it an ‘isolated incident’. But every three days in the UK, a woman is murdered by her partner or ex-partner. In this context, it is far from ‘isolated’. It is devastating."" Another user wrote: ""Police forces really need to stop describing domestic homicides as an 'isolated incident'. I get the reasoning behind it (to reassure the public of no wider risk), but just say you're not seeking anyone else in connection. It's never an isolated incident, it's part of an epidemic. ""It isn't an 'isolated incident' when women are killed in their homes twice a week,"" one said. The tragic case in Epsom comes a day before the sentencing of David Carrick, a former Metropolitan Police officer jailed for life with a minimum term of 30 years for raping and abusing women.   The twisted sex offender had controlled and coerced his victims before repeatedly raping them at his home in Stevenage over a 17-year period of offending. He had locked women in small cupboards under his stairs, urinated on them, whipped them and caused them to choke on their own vomit in just a few examples of his depraved behaviour.  Carrick, 48, had been a serving firearms officer with the Met since 2001 and had been referred for his behaviour on nice occasions but had never faced misconduct proceedings.  Victims felt unable to report his sadistic crimes as he often threatened they would not be believed and as he said, “I am the law”. In sentencing, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb remarked: “These women are not weak or ineffectual. They were victims of your criminal mindset. “The malign influence of men like you in positions of power stands in the way of a revolution of women’s dignity.  ""It is remarkable that with one woman being driven to report an allegation against you, despite your position and power, others felt able to act. Even today, courage calls to courage everywhere and its voice cannot be denied.” Also in London, a man has been jailed for a minimum of 20 years for murdering his partner Marlene Coleman at her home in Lewisham.  Franklin McLeod stabbed her through the neck and left her to die in a pool of her own blood after finding messages from another man on her Whatsapp.  Elsewhere in the UK, recent headlines have been dominated by reports of women being murdered, abused and raped by male offenders. On Monday, a man was found guilty in Edinburgh of luring a 25-year-old woman and her young daughter up to Dundee where he killed them and buried their bodies under his kitchen floor. Andrew Innes had met Bennylyn Burke on a dating website and convinced her to travel with him to Scotland with her two-year-old Jellica.   He then hit her with a hammer and stabbed her with a Samurai sword and killed her daughter as it “seemed logical to put her with her mum”.  He has now been jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years. In response, a spokesperson for Surrey Police told MyLondon: “We are aware of concern and upset at the use of the term 'isolated incident' in our communication surrounding the deaths of three people at Epsom College on Sunday, 5 February. “Our intention was to explain there was no wider risk to the public or the communities in the surrounding area, but we fully recognise the impact this language has had and we welcome this scrutiny and feedback.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/police-spark-anger-calling-tragic-29169061
Relative of girl 'beaten in racist attack' outside school wants teachers sacked,"As police continue an investigation into the harrowing brawl outside Thomas Knyvett College in Ashford, Surrey, a relative of one of the victims is demanding the school take the strongest action A relative of one of the victims of a 'racist attack' outside a school has demanded the teachers who 'allowed' the horrific altercation to unfold are fired.  Police are investigating after shocking footage of a schoolgirl appearing to be viciously assaulted on a road caused outrage online. The force today revealed two people were hurt in the brutal incident on Monday afternoon, with the clip showing a woman egging on the teen attackers.  Four people so far have been arrested on suspicion of attempted racially aggravated grievous bodily harm, including a 39-year-old woman, two girls aged 11 and another aged 16.  A 43-year-old man was also arrested.  Speaking to The Mirror at a demonstration outside Thomas Knyvett College in Ashford, Surrey, where the assault took place, a relative of one of the victims claims teachers could seen in the video appearing to do little to defuse the situation.  She wants them sacked and told how her heart sank when she viewed the horrifying footage on social media.  She claims the attack began after one of the girls' called the mother of another a 's**g'. The clip shows the girl's braids yanked from her hair scattered down the road and Ms Elliot said: ""She’s 15 She's in her last year of school here and she was actually helping her friend.  ""No one from the school brought her back to us We had to go her and get her home. They let her go to my friend's house and then from her friend's house she used her friend's phone to call us.  ""She said 'nobody helped me, they were laughing at me one of the teachers laughed at with my braids on the floor'.  ""She had nine braids pulled from her head from the roots and when we look, you can see the dots where they came off the scalp. ""I was thinking 'who's coming who's going to stop it? Who’s jumping out that car?'   ""Seeing her heard pulled in all directions, all of the cars stopping, I was thinking 'who’s jumping out of that car?'."" Speaking about the girl's recovery, she added: ""She was very lost. Very sad. I think she's her morale has been boosted because of people, she knows she's not alone. ""It's one of those things you when you see on social media just thinking it hurts you so bad. Even then, even if it's not on your doorstep, we still feel that same thing. It's distressing."" Now she is demanding action, saying: ""I want them to get rid of those teachers (in the video) I want them to present us with their anti racism policy.   ""What do you guys do when all these kids when you get keep getting these reports? What do you do? What are you going to do about it? ""That's the thing, it's not a serious issue in this neighbourhood. There's not enough black people. ""When I asked him (head teacher Richard Besson) in the meeting, I said 'do you know what hurt me the most in that video?' I was asking who's going to stop it?

"Family pet that killed girl, 4, in savage dog attack is not from a banned breed","Four-year-old Alice Stones was savaged by the family's pet dog in the back yard of her home in Milton Keynes. Police have not disclosed the breed of the dogThe family dog that killed a four-year-old girl in a horror arrack in her own back garden was not a banned breed, police have announced.  Alice Stones was savaged by the crazed animal in the back yard of her home in Milton Keynes on the evening of January 31.  Thames Valley Police have formally identified the toddler and confirmed testing has revealed the dog was not on the banned breed list. In a statement they said: ""There has also been a large amount of speculation around the breed of the dog.  ""Although we are not in a position to confirm the exact breed of the dog due to the requirement for further testing, we are able to confirm that the dog is not a banned breed."" Mum Louise Stones, 25, was overheard screaming “she’s dead, she’s dead” after witnessing the horrific attack.   Members of the emergency services rushed to the scene but tragically Alice was pronounced dead. Shortly afterwards the dog was shot dead by armed cops. Rita Matthews, who lives two doors away from the scene, said she knew Louise as they walked their children to school together. She said: ""The first I knew what was happening was when lots of police cars turned up in the street. Officers told everyone that nobody was to go outside their homes. ""I used to walk to school with little Alice's mum so I know the family quite well. Her parents are a couple and are lovely people.  “She was always holding her mummy's hand on the way back. ""She would say, 'Bye, auntie', and I would say, 'Bye, little girl', you know kids, playing around. ""It's so sad we're not going to see the girl again and I pray all the best to her mum to get her strength back."" Several bouquets of flowers were left at the scene of the tragedy as specialist police officers continue to help the family. Local community councillor Donna Fuller said at the time: ""Netherfield is a very tight-knit estate and the whole community is grieving. There is a profound sense of sadness and shock at what has happened.""   Friends are now raising money online to support the single mum as she prepares for her daughter’s funeral.  In an update on the GoFundMe, pal Grace Wenham posted a new photo of little Alice. It shows the tragic youngster blowing out candles on her birthday cake after turning four last August. In a note accompanying the snap Grace posted a message from Alice’s grieving mum and other relatives. She wrote: ""The family … want to thank everyone who has donated, shared or sent their condolences during this horrendous time. ""Nothing has gone unnoticed and they are overwhelmed with the love felt by the community during this unthinkable tragedy.""  The fund, which will pay for the funeral and living costs for Louise, now stands at nearly £3,000. The page says: ""Sadly, on the 31st January 2023, this world lost a beautiful little 4 year old girl to a tragic, awful accident. ""We are the close friends and family of this loving mother and daughter, we are seeking support in raising money to help towards cost of funeral and living in this desperate time of need.

Nicola Bulley’s friend identifies critical ‘blind spot’ in desperate appeal for evidence,"Jill Peck has alerted those looking for Nicola Bulley of a critical ‘blind spot’ as the leader of a specialist investigation team said his “gut instinct” was that there was a “third party” involved Those searching for missing mum Nicola Bulley have been told of a critical ‘blind spot’ after another appeal for evidence.  Friend Jill Peck has highlighted a “missing” section of road in the investigation into her disappearance. She has called for calling for anyone with dash-cam footage to come forward as they “just need answers”. The 45-year-old vanished on a dog walk in St Michaels on Wyre on January 27. Her phone was found on a bench overlooking the water and major search effort was launched.   Detectives maintain their “working hypothesis” is that Ms Bulley fell into the river as the leader of a specialist investigation team said his “gut instinct” was that there was a “third party” involved. Police have drafted in independent underwater forensic experts Specialist Group International this week as the hunt continues. Now, close friend Ms Peck has launched a further appeal as she desperately awaits news. She told GB News: “We just need some answers, we need factual facts, we need evidence. Anyone out there that feels they may have dashcam footage, there's a section of road that we're missing, Garstang Road towards St Michaels. ""We just need some answers,” she added.  Police had earlier identified a key ten-minute gap in their knowledge of Ms Bulley’s movements on the day she vanished. The gap is between 9.10am when she was last seen, and 9.20am, which is when police believe her phone was placed on the bench where it was later found. Another of her friends, Heather Gibbons, said ""nothing is making sense"" in the case as she said speculation on social media is hurtful to the family.  She told the BBC : ""I know that the family are massively appreciative of all the police have done [and] we feel we have got the best of the best on that water.  ""Hopefully it will be a completion, one way or the other, and if they find nothing, then maybe it's time to start looking down other avenues. ""Up to a certain level, we understand it's human nature, it's natural for everyone to have speculation, because the truth is in this, nothing is making sense.""   Firm chief Peter Faulding previously told the Mirror his team's sonar could find Nicola in under an hour if she is in the river - however, he expressed doubts she ever fell in.  He added that he considered it almost impossible that she would have been dragged down to the estuary, hypothesising that a body would become ""snagged"" within 500 metres of the entry point.  His team yesterday trawled what they consider the ""hot zone"", as well several miles up and downstream, but neither they nor police specialists found any evidence of Nicola.  Lancashire Police Superintendent Sally Riley told a press briefing on Tuesday the force continued to rule out any ""suspicious or criminal"" element to the case.  She said a team of 40 detectives are working on around 500 different lines of inquiry and are identifying more than 700 drivers who travelled through the village around the time Nicola disappeared. She said: ""This is normal in a missing person inquiry and does not indicate that there is any suspicious element to this story. ""The inquiry team remains fully open-minded to any information that may indicate where Nicola is or what happened to her."" But the police chief emphasised that detectives have not yet come across any evidence of foul play. ""Any criminal or suspicious element has been discarded,"" she said. ""It is important to stress that any information that comes in that indicates otherwise is being checked out all the time. ""We are not closed in any way to any particular line of inquiry but all these extensive inquiries, however, have so far found anything of note.""

Kim Jong-un’s daughter appears at North Korean military parade amid succession rumours,"Kim Ju-ae, who is thought to be around 9 and 11, made her fourth public appearance in three months as Kim Jong-un held a 75th anniversary dinner of the North Korean People’s ArmyKim Jong-un's daughter has appeared in public for the North Korean military parade prompting speculation she could be set to succeed him.  Kim Ju-ae, who is thought to be around 9 and 11, made her fourth public appearance in three months after she was spotted with her parents at the 75th anniversary of the Korean People’s Army. She was sat alongside the North Korean leader and his wife, Ri Sol-ju as they celebrated the anniversary.  The Korean Central News Agency said: “Commanding officers . . . greeted with the warmest reverence the respected Comrade Kim Jong-un whom they wanted to see even in their dreams when he arrived at the lodging quarters together with his respected daughter.   “They were greatly excited to get convinced of the eternal security and future of the country as they are led by the ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commander who is ushering in a new era.” There were sounds of music and aircraft flying in Pyongyang just after midnight as the North Korean leader held a military parade, according to the news website NK New. Kim, alongside his daughter, told officers: “I am haunted by the unforgettable names and images of the service personnel of the preceding generations who devoted themselves to defending the vigorous advance of the ever-victorious Korean revolution and boosting the invincibility and mightiness of our state.”  The daughter was first seen in public last November, which has led to growing speculation she is the ""future"" of the country, with commentators believing she is set to succeed her dad. This would set a new precedent in North Korea as Kim and his dad, Kim Jong-il, were both adults before they were publicly known as successors.  Kim, 39 and Ri, 33, reportedly have three children including an older son and two daughters with Ju-ae being the second or third child.  In North Korea, it was highly unusual for a female to lead or appear in public with their partners but since Kim replaced his father 11 years ago this has started to change. Ri is regularly seen with her husband and one of his most senior aides is 35-year-old Kim Yo-jong, who is his sister.  His foreign minister is Choe Son-hui, 58, a career diplomat and interpreter, is also regularly seen with the dictator.

Inside maggot and insect infested bedroom of teen left to die in filth by parents,"WARNING DISTRESSING IMAGES. Kaylea Titford, 16, died in conditions which were said to be ""unfit for any animal"" with images from her bedroom showing incontinence pads as well as an infestation of maggots and insectsKaylea Titford died with her uncaring dad texting her to “stop screaming” as the teenager lay amid maggots and filth as the true extent of the squalor emerge with images of her bedroom. The 16-year-old was found in conditions described as ""unfit for any animal"", in soiled clothing and bed linen, following her death at the family home in Newtown, Powys, Wales, in October 2020. She weighed 22st 13lb, with a BMI of 70, at the time of her death, Mold Crown Court heard. Images from Kaylea's bedroom shows incontinence pads designed for animals, bottles of urine, maggots and an infestation of insects. Around the bed, which was filthy with maggots, almost every surface was covered with rubbish including old food and wrappers, while on a table was a full cake in a box from the teenager's birthday weeks earlier.   Her “lazy” father Alun Titford shared the blame with her mother for the death of their 'independent' disabled daughter who had been left to die at her home. The removal man 45, was found guilty by a jury at Mold crown court of manslaughter by gross negligence after denying the charge. Her mother Sarah Lloyd-Jones, aged 40, a community care worker, had admitted manslaughter by gross negligence last year.  On the night before Kaylea was found dead in her bed, her father had even texted her to tell her to “stop screaming” and despite living in the same house, he hadn’t seen her for around two weeks. The court heard that Kaylea, who had spina bifida and used a wheelchair, died after suffering inflammation and infection from ulceration, arising from obesity and immobility.  Emergency service workers, who were called to the house after she was found on October 10, 2020, described feeling sick due to a ""rotting"" smell in her room. Following her death maggots were found which were thought to have been feeding on her body, the jury was told. The footage was shown in court of the horrific conditions with what appear to have been the puppy toilet training pads on the bed and masses of rubbish piled up.  The court heard that Kaylea had attended Newtown High School, where she was described as ""funny and chatty"" by staff, but did not return following the coronavirus lockdown in March 2020. Her father Alun Titford was released on bail ahead of his sentencing at Swansea Crown Court on March 1 but was warned by the judge he faces prison.

Student nurse applications tumble by almost a third since height of Covid pandemic,"Just 33,570 people applied to a UK nurse undergraduate course by the January deadline, down from 41,220 in 2022 and 46,040 in 2021Student nurse applications have dropped almost a third since the height of the pandemic. Just 33,570 people applied to a UK nurse undergraduate course by the January deadline, down from 41,220 in 2022 and 46,040 in 2021. The 27% fall in two years was revealed by UCAS data as 15,000 nurses were striking over a real-terms NHS pay cut from the Tories. There are a record high 47,000 nursing vacancies in England.  The Royal College of Nursing staged a two-day walkout this week after the Government only granted the NHS a 4% pay rise, with inflation running at over 10%.    General Secretary Pat Cullen said: “These figures are damning for the Government. Not only are they losing record experienced nurses but they are compounding the problem by deterring the next generation.  “Nursing staff – today’s and tomorrow’s alike – need to know they are valued and that starts with fair pay.” The UCAS data also shows nursing course applications from over-35s dropped to 7,230 for 2023, compared to 9,300 two years earlier. Ms Cullen added: “A big drop in mature student applicants to nursing courses is deeply concerning too.  “During the pandemic, people were drawn to apply to study nursing by the professionalism showcased. These figures show that has been reversed entirely. Ultimately, patient care will continue to suffer.” Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: “It is a badge of shame for the Conservatives that they have turned off thousands of young people from a career in the NHS when we need them more than ever before.” A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “We know the number of applicants was exceptionally high during the pandemic but there continues to be strong interest in nursing and midwifery careers, with applications above 2019 levels.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/student-nurse-applications-tumble-almost-29169653
"Epsom headteacher dances with daughter, 7, before being 'shot by dad in murder-suicide'","Sweet footage shows Epsom College headteacher Emma Pattison and her daughter Lettie beaming towards the camera while singing and dancing around in their kitchenA heartbreaking video has emerged showing Epsom College headteacher Emma Pattison performing a dance duet with her daughter Lettie. The mum, 45, her husband George, 39, and their seven-year-old were tragically found dead at their home in the grounds of Epsom College in Surrey on Sunday. Yesterday, police confirmed they had launched a homicide investigation, and said Mr Pattison legally owned a gun that was discovered at the scene. The deaths are being investigated as a possible murder-suicide, where Mr Pattison killed his wife and daughter before turning the gun on himself. A touching clip has now come to light in the wake of the tragedy, capturing Emma and Lettie beaming towards the camera while dancing in their kitchen.   The video was filmed in 2020 as the joyous pair sang along and jumped around to Justin Timberlake's Can't Stop The Feeling. It comes as tributes pour in for the family from school workers, friends and ex-colleagues. Nursery worker Chloe Rathbone, who previously took care of Lettie, said she was ""utterly heartbroken"" over the young child's death. She told The Times: ""I knew Emma, George and Lettie and I am utterly heartbroken over this news."" The 27-year-old added: ""Lettie was perfect in every way.""  A neighbour also paid tribute to the young girl, telling The Telegraph: ""You used to hear her playing in the garden, she was always asking them questions and just seemed like a happy, inquisitive little girl."" Another resident said: ""She was just a typical, well brought-up, lovely little girl. It’s just tragic."" Emma's former colleagues released a statement in memory of their ""dear friend"", saying they are ""immensely shocked and saddened"" by the news of her death. Speaking on behalf of Ms Pattison's former workplace Croydon High School, Cheryl Giovannoni said: ""We are immensely shocked and saddened by the news about the death of Emma Pattison, her daughter Lettie and her husband George.  ""Our thoughts are with their family at this time, as well as everyone at Croydon High School, and Epsom College, which Emma joined as head in September 2022. ""Emma was a much loved and respected member of the GDST community, as well as a talented head and teacher and a dear friend to many of us. ""She touched the lives of all of us with her energy, wisdom and kindness during her six years as head of Croydon High School and the school will always bear the legacy of her inspiring leadership. ""We are taking time to support staff and students at Croydon High School as well as everyone in the GDST family, and their wellbeing will be our priority in the coming days.""  The tragedy has rocked the local community and school, which will reportedly close until after the half-term break as police conduct their investigation. In a letter to parents, the BBC reported that Mr Williams said: ""Now is a time for families to come together and try and process this shocking news.  ""The impact on your children cannot be underestimated and we are doing everything we possibly can to support them in whatever way they need."" Mrs Pattison had reportedly contacted her sister with concerns about her husband in the hours before the killings, and when she arrived at the house she found all three members of the family dead.  While a gun was found at the scene, the force said causes of death will not be confirmed until post-mortem examinations are carried out later this week.  Mr Pattison had been in contact with Surrey Police just days before the killings about his gun licence in order to change his address after the family moved to the school site from Caterham.  A statement from the force said: ""We had contact with George on February 2 after he notified us of a previous change of address, as is routine.  ""Due to the short period of time between that contact and this incident, we have made a referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.""  The IOPC said it is assessing the information available to decide if any further action is necessary.  Detective Chief Inspector Kimball Edey, senior investigating officer on the case, said: ""This is an incredibly traumatic incident and we are working around the clock to investigate and understand the exact circumstances which led to this point.  ""We understand the public concern and upset, and we will clarify what we can, when we can, while respecting the right to a level of privacy for the families of those who have lost their lives.""

Almost ALL families struggling to pay energy bills will still be in fuel poverty in 2030,"Ministers have been accused of 'throwing in the towel' on tackling fuel poverty - as Greenpeace UK threatens legal action over the Government's failure to meet requirements to reduce fuel povertyAlmost 95% of families struggling to pay their energy bills will still be in fuel poverty in 2030, analysis shows. Ministers have been accused of ""throwing in the towel"" on tackling fuel poverty. Research shows just 6% of fuel poor households will be out of that category by the end of the decade. Greenpeace UK is threatening legal action over the Government's failure to meet requirements to reduce fuel poverty. The charity said ministers are using outdated fuel poverty data from 2020 in its strategy. The Government said energy efficiency policies would reduce the number of households that were in fuel poverty in 2020 by 12% by 2030. Read More
  However, the number of fuel poor households in the UK - now an estimated 6.7 million - has more than doubled since then due to wholesale energy price rises over the last year. Greenpeace calculated that this means the number of households in fuel poverty will only reduce by 5.8% by 2030. Under the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000, the government is obliged to upgrade as many homes “as is reasonably practicable” of people living in fuel poverty by the end of 2030. Greenpeace’s lawyers believe it is “potentially unlawful” the Government is failing in this “legal duty”. The charity is threatening to take the Government to court unless it immediately carries out a review into its strategy for tackling fuel poverty and demonstrates how the target could be hit. Greenpeace’s head of UK climate Mel Evans said: “By throwing in the towel on tackling fuel poverty the government has shackled the poorest people to the coldest homes and the highest bills.  “Almost a quarter of all households are now in fuel poverty. This is a national crisis yet the government’s failing strategy for tackling it means that at this rate it won’t meet its legally binding 2030 target until close to the end of the next century. “A national home insulation programme can lift people out of fuel poverty, support better health and tackle the climate emergency. Unless the government gets on with it, we'll see them in court.” A Government spokeswoman said: “The fuel poverty target for England is to ensure that as many fuel poor homes as possible achieve a minimum energy efficiency rating of band C by 2030. ""Thanks to government support, the number of homes with this rating or above has already gone from 13% in 2010 to 46% and rising. “Improving the energy efficiency of homes is the best long-term method of tackling fuel poverty, and that’s why we’ve committed over £6.6 billion in this parliament, with a further £6 billion committed to 2028, to ensure all homes meet EPC band C by 2035.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/almost-families-struggling-pay-energy-29167934
'There's a risk if the UK sends aircraft to Ukraine - but risk of Putin win is greater',"Rishi Sunak, who had ruled out sending aircraft to help Ukrainians repel the Russians, immediately announced the Government was now reviewing this decisionVolodymyr Zelenksy was loudly cheered when he addressed MPs and peers yesterday in Westminster Hall. The Ukrainian president did not make the dangerous journey for the applause. He travelled here to plead for more military support, in particular British fighter jets. As he so eloquently and simply put it, Ukraine needs “wings for freedom”. His visit may not have been in vain. Rishi Sunak, who had ruled out sending aircraft to help Ukrainians repel the Russians, immediately announced the Government was now reviewing this decision. Britain is not the only country weighing up whether or not to answer Zelensky’s call. The US is unwilling to provide combat jets amid fears it could hike tensions with Russia, causing the war to spill beyond Ukraine. Yet many will question why Ukraine’s allies, which have already sent tanks and missiles, are reluctant to supply fighter planes at such a pivotal moment in the conflict. While there is a risk that sending aircraft will inflame the situation, the risk of allowing Putin to win this war could be far greater.  Fatal mistake  Loudmouth Lee Anderson keeps his brain in neutral before voicing an opinion. The new Tory deputy chairman previously claimed there is not a huge need for foodbanks and people who use them cannot budget. In his latest outburst he called for a return of capital punishment, as it is 100% effective. It would not have occurred to him his stance runs contrary to No10’s attempts to persuade other countries to abolish the death penalty. Since the UK ended capital punishment in 1965 there have been dozens of miscarriages of justice, including the Birmingham Six. If Mr Anderson had his way then innocent people would have been executed. Tom squids in Celebrity chef Tom Kerridge is selling a ready-made fish pie for £60.

Just Stop Oil activists who glued themselves to Da Vinci painting fined just £175 each,"Caspar Hughes sprayed onto the wall 'no new oil' and then he and Simon Bramwell, Jessica Agar, Lucy Porter and Tristan Strange glued themselves to the frame of the painting in July last yearFive Just Stop Oil activists who glued themselves to the frame of a copy of Leonardo Da Vinci's 'The Last Supper' have been fined just £175 each. Simon Bramwell, 50, Caspar Hughes, 51, Jessica Agar, 22, Lucy Porter, 47 and Tristan Strange, 40, sprayed 'No New Oil' under the £3m painting at the Royal Academy on July 5 last year.  The activists are members of the climate group 'Just Stop Oil' who are campaigning to stop the government's purchase of new oil and gas licences. As well at the 175 fine, they must also each pay £275 in costs and £36 in compensation. District Judge William Nelson told the court: ""Five defendants in this case are charged with criminal damage. ""The basic facts of the matter are on Tuesday 5 July 2022 at about 11am the five entered the Royal Academy and made their way to the first-floor gallery where there is in that collection a painting of the 'Last Supper'. ""After a period of time Mr Hughes took a spray can from his bag and sprayed onto the wall 'no new oil' and then all five defendants put glue on their hands and glued themselves to the painting.   ""Ms Porter's hand became detached from their own accord and the others in the room had their hands de-bonded from the de-bonding team. ""The prosecution's case is they intentionally or recklessly caused damage to that frame the wall and sofa on which glue was found. ""The defence case was framed in two ways. Firstly, that they did not intend nor were reckless of [causing damage to the frame or wall] and no damage was caused to the sofa and they were not the causes of the damage to the sofa. ""The damage caused to the wall, frame and sofa was temporary and they say it was a non-violent protest meaning the court must consider proportionality.  ""I am not satisfied so I'm sure that [none] of these defendants caused damage to the sofa, the evidence points to the contrary.CCTV shows these defendants were far away from the sofa ''The inference I'm asked to draw... is that the only people with glue in the room were the five defendants and so it must have been one of them. ""In fact, the de-bonding team used that sofa to park their equipment.. it's for the Crown to prove so I am sure it was one of these defendants or all defendants that caused this damage and they haven't been able to do so in these circumstances. ""None of the defendants are guilty of damage of the sofa.  ""As far as the frame is concerned all five defendants accept, they placed glued on their hands and glued themselves to the wall... ""Mr Hughes accept he is the person who painted the slogan on the wall, but all the defendants knew this was what he was going to do, and they all acted as an accessory to the plan and the encouragement of the activity...and recognised the application of the paint was a sign of their start the protest. ""Therefore, they are all responsible for that damage. ""The next question is did they intend to cause that damage? In my judgment no, they didn't intend to cause damage.  ""All defendants gave very clear evidence that the primary purpose of their endeavour was to attract the attention of major media outputs to give the widest audience their message. 'They did not intend that their actions or the primary cause of their actions would be damage. Damage occurred in the course of their action, but it was not their intentions. ""It is clear to me that in the minds of each five defendants they had intended it does not cause any damage to the actual painting and they had gone to great length not to do so. ""They made previous visits to the venue, experiment with glue themselves and made sure they applied their hands as far away from the painting.  ""As far as the frame was concerned there was a risk of damage, but it would be minor. ""Each defendant was well aware of the risk of damage that their actions would cause. ""Each defendant knew they would cause damage to the frame and they gave clear evidence about this. ""I find each defendant in connection to damage of paint and frame was reckless in whether damage would occur to the wall and the frame. ""In all the circumstances I find the five defendants guilty of damaging the wall and frame and there is no need for me to set out a proportionality exercise."" The Royal Academy copy - which is attributed to Giampietrino and Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio - is believed to be the most accurate record of the original and was painted in around 1515-20. The oil on canvas painting is about 3020mm x 7850mm, which makes it slightly smaller than the original. Bramwell, of Twyford, Berks, Hughes, of Exeter, Devon, Agar, of Hereford, Porter, of Worcester and Strange, of Swindon, all denied one count of criminal damage. During the summer Just Stop Oil activists attached themselves to a 19th-century landscape by Horatio McCulloch called My Heart's In The Highlands which hangs in Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum.

Tory deputy chairman Lee Anderson calls for death penalty to be brought back,"Lee Anderson, who was promoted to the upper echelons of the Conservative Party on Tuesday, said in an interview that capital punishment has a ""100% success rate"" for preventing reoffendingThe newly-installed deputy chairman of the Conservative Party has called for the return of the death penalty. Controversial right-winger Lee Anderson claimed that capital punishment has a ""100% success rate"" and said Lee Rigby's killers should have been ""gone the same week"".  Mr Anderson, who was previously nicknamed 30p Lee after claiming he could cook meals from scratch for this sum, told The Spectator magazine: ""Nobody has ever committed a crime after being executed."" And to those who warn this can lead to wrongful executions, he said: ""Well, you can prove it if they have videoed it and are on camera – like the Lee Rigby killers. I mean: they should have gone, same week."" The last execution in the UK took place in 1964 after reviews by the Criminal Cases Review Commission led to one person being pardoned and three exonerated after their deaths. The Red Wall MP, who has represented Ashfield in Nottinghamshire since 2019, was a surprise pick for the Tory Party deputy chairman position this week.   He is a divisive figure in his own party, with one fellow Tory MP accusing him of ""deliberately provoking and making aggressive simplistic statements"". Mr Anderson hit the headlines in 2021 when he refused to support the England team's run to the final in the European Championships in a protest over players taking the knee. And in an address at the party conference in September last year he claimed food banks were staffed by ""do gooders"" trying to ""make themselves feel good"". The former coal miner, 56, said he's not ""some toffee nosed Tory"", telling the magazine he'd experienced poverty himself as a single dad, and added: ""There is nowhere more deprived than the street I was brought up on.""  The new Tory chairman, Greg Hands, said he expected Mr Anderson to be a ""great asset"", saying he had ""great integrity"". The appointment of Mr Anderson, an MP from a so-called Red Wall seat with a tendency to make controversial comments, is seen as an attempt to balance giving the party chairmanship to a previously remain-supporting London MP in Mr Hands. Mr Anderson has been dubbed ""30p Lee"" for claiming that meals could be prepared for that sum and suggesting people using food banks could not budget. In 2021, when the men's Euro 2020 football tournament was taking place, he vowed to boycott England matches in protest against the players' anti-racism stance of taking the knee before matches. Even when Gareth Southgate's team got to the final, Mr Anderson said he would not tune in, although he admitted he might check the score on his phone. Mr Hands declined to say whether he backed some of Mr Anderson's past comments, but told LBC he had not ""studied every single pronouncement made by Conservative backbenchers"". He said he would not comment on things that had been said in the past, but was looking forward to working with Mr Anderson. Asked if he or the party endorsed those various views, he said: ""In terms of things that may or may not have been said in the past, I don't have encyclopaedic knowledge of what everybody has ever said in the past."" Ashfield MP Mr Anderson will have a ""fairly wide-ranging role"", the Prime Minister's press secretary said. ""Lee Anderson is a very hard-working MP, he's an excellent campaigner, he is very popular, particularly in his constituency and he will do a fantastic job working with the new chairman to champion the Conservative Party and everything this Conservative government is doing,"" she added.

Rishi Sunak denies holding back on Ukraine warplanes as Boris Johnson rubbishes excuse,"Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky warned that without sophisticated fighter jets and long-range missiles to defend the skies, the war risks entering a long period of ""stagnation"" Rishi Sunak has denied holding back on sending fighter jets to Ukraine - as his predecessor Boris Johnson clamours for Typhoons to be sent immediately.  The Prime Minister is under pressure to bow to requests by Ukrainian president for high-tech planes that will help protect the war-torn country from Russian ""terrorists"".  Today Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made a passionate plea for more weapons to fight off Vladimir Putin's forces, and at a press conference in Dorset warned that without more equipment the country faces ""stagnation"".  An awkward-looking Mr Sunak insisted that ""nothing is off the table"", but said the length of time it takes to train pilots to fly sophisticated warplanes is a stumbling block.  This afternoon Boris Johnson dismissed Downing Street's insistence that it's not practical, telling LBC: “The important thing now is that his message is heard. What he’s asking for is the tools to finish the job – that’s all he wants. “He just wants the ability to use the long-range missiles - the deep fryers as they’re called - to take out Putin’s positions and he wants the ability to keep his country safe with more tanks and planes.  ""His appeal was very, very interesting for the focus he put on aviation and on planes.”   Addressing journalists through a translator, Mr Zelensky said that without the fighter jets he is asking for there is a risk of ""stagnation"". He said: ""Now we've come to kind of this stagnation phase. ""You've just asked me what would happen if we don't get these fighter jets or longer-range missiles, or we don't have enough ammunition, because everything obviously is running out and coming out of maintenance. ""Without the weapons that we are discussing now and the weapons that we just discussed with Rishi earlier today and how Britain is going to help us, you know, all of this is very important. Without this, there would be stagnation which will not bring to anything good."" Standing alongside Mr Zelensky, Mr Sunak said this evening: ""Nothing is off the table."" But there was no announcement that the desired fighter jets were being supplied, with the PM saying it takes three years to train a pilot to fly a ""sophisticated piece of kit"".  He hit back at critics, saying: ""I don't think there's a reticence at all."" The Prime Minister said: ""There is a supply chain around such sophisticated aircraft. ""Those are conversations that the president and I are having and making sure we understand all the supply chain needs that go alongside aircraft like that - making sure they can be used and used safely, kept safely. So we are having that conversation. ""And it is also a conversation we are having with our allies because, particularly some of the aircraft we have, are done through joint treaty with multiple other countries - I think we have seen that with previous bits of kit that others have had to give. ""For aircraft, that is something we are also involved in because, as I said, we have other allies involved in the provision of those bits of equipment. ""And as the president said, he is on his way to Europe after this to pick up this conversation with our partners and allies over there.""  Earlier today Mr Zelensky used a speech in Westminster Hall to make an impassioned plea for warplanes. Hundreds of MPs, peers, staff and journalists applauded and cheered as he arrived in the historic Westminster Hall to make a speech, the first foreign leader to do so since ex-US President Barack Obama gave a speech there in 2011. In a passionate address, Mr Zelensky praised the ""brave souls"" of the UK for their support on behalf of his people. ""I have come here and stand before you on behalf of the brave, on behalf of our war heroes who are now in the trenches under enemy artillery fire,"" he said. ""On behalf of our air gunners, and every defender of the sky who protects Ukraine against enemy aircraft and missiles, on behalf of our tank men who fight to restore our Ukrainian borders, on behalf of our conscripts who are being trained now including here in Britain."" Mr Zelensky said London had ""stood with Kyiv since day one"" and he praised ex-PM Boris Johnson, who was in the audience, for helping to unite allies when ""it seemed impossible"".  His speech was repeatedly met with applause ringing through ancient hall as he said: ""We know freedom will win.  ""We know Russia will lose. And the victory will change the world - a change the world has long needed."" Ahead of the visit, the Prime Minister announced plans to train Ukrainian pilots to allow them to fly sophisticated NATO-standard fighter jets - a key demand from Ukraine. The Ukrainian leader used his speech to strengthen his pleas for the West to provide fighter jets for his forces, saying: ""I appeal to you and the world with simple and yet most important words: combat aircraft for Ukraine, wings for freedom.""  He gave a nod to the Royal Family's military background, saying: ""The King is an Air Force pilot. And in Ukraine today, every Air Force pilot is a king.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/rishi-sunak-denies-holding-back-29168458
Dominic Raab spotted giving Keir Starmer an absolute 'death stare' during Zelensky visit,"The under-fire Deputy Prime Minister fixed Mr Starmer with a hard, unblinking stare, shooting daggers at him for a solid seven secondsDominic Raab spotted giving Keir Starmer the evils during President Zelensky's visit to Parliament.  The Labour leader was filmed chatting to Rishi Sunak as both waited for the Ukrainian leader to deliver his speech.  But as other MPs made small talk around them, the under-fire Deputy Prime Minister fixed Mr Starmer with a hard, unblinking stare, shooting daggers at him for a solid seven seconds. The awkward moment was spotted by Byline Times' Adam Bienkov, who simply tweeted: ""Raging.""      In November, Mr Raab was accused of mouthing ""w****r"" under his breath at Mr Starmer during PMQs.   And he sparked fury by apparently winking at Angela Rayner over the dispatch box during another fiery Parliamentary set-to.  He later denied he was winking at Ms Rayner, but was targeting his half-blink at shadow Scotland secretary Ian Murray.     Mr Sunak continued to face questions yesterday about the future of Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab, who remained in place after the reshuffle.  Mr Raab, who is also the Justice Secretary, is being investigated by senior lawyer Adam Tolley KC over bullying allegations - with dozens of officials thought to be involved in eight formal complaints. Mr Raab has denied the allegations.   ""The independent adviser is conducting his investigation; I can't prejudge the outcome of that investigation. It's right that it concludes,"" the Prime Minister said. ""But as people have seen from how I've acted in the past, when I'm presented with conclusive independent findings that someone in my Government has not acted with the integrity or standards that I would expect of them, I won't hesitate to take swift and decisive action. ""That's what I've done in the past. But with regard to this situation, it's right that we let the independent process continue,"" Mr Sunak said.

Government's anti-terror programme failing to tackle 'non-violent Islamist extremism',"Suella Braverman said 'major reform' is needed of the controversial Prevent programme after a long-delayed review. But Amnesty International said it was 'riddled with biased thinking, errors, and plain anti-Muslim prejduice'The UK Government's controversial anti-terror programme is not doing enough to tackle ""non-violent Islamist extremism"", a landmark report claims. The long-delayed review of Prevent - which aims to stop people being radicalised into terrorism - says it must return to its ""core mission"". ""Prevent must return to its overarching objective: to stop individuals from becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism,"" it states. The review adds that it is ""correct"" for the anti-terror programme to be increasingly concerned about the growing threat from the extreme right. But it claims: ""The facts clearly demonstrate that the most lethal threat in the last 20 years has come from Islamism, and this threat continues.""  The review of Prevent was first commissioned in 2019 by Priti Patel and in the time since, several terrorist attacks have ""blighted our nation"", the report states.    They include the attack on Fishmongers' Hall in central London in November 2019 and the murder of the Tory MP David Amess at his constituency surgery in Southend in October 2021. The 192-page review states Prevent ""is not doing enough to counter non-violent Islamist extremism"" and ""has a double standard when dealing with the extreme right-wing and Islamism"". Mr Shawcross says it is ""clear"" Prevent is ""out of kilter with the rest of the counter-terrorism system, and the UK terrorism threat picture"". ""Islamist extremism represents the primary terrorist threat to this country – consistently accounting for the majority of terrorist attack plots both carried out and thwarted by the intelligence services,"" his report adds. It also warns that Prevent is ""carrying the weight for mental health services"" with some being referred to the scheme ""who do not necessarily pose a terrorism risk are being referred to Prevent to access other types of much-needed support"". ""This is a serious misallocation of resources and risks diverting attention from the threat itself"".  In her own response, the Home Secretary Suella Braverman said Prevent needs ""major reform"", as she vowed to implement all the review's recommendations.  The Cabinet minister told MPs: ""Prevent needs to better understand the threats we face and the ideology underpinning them."" Ms Braverman added: ""80% of Counter Terrorism Police network’s live investigations are Islamist. MI5 are clear that Islamist terrorism remains our predominant threat, accounting for 75% of their caseload. Yet only 16% of Prevent referrals in 2021-22 were Islamist.  ""Prevent has shown cultural timidity and an institutional hesitancy to tackle Islamism for fear of the charge of ‘Islamophobia’. These are false charges that spread fear and misinformation in communities."" But Amensty International's UK Racial Justice Director Ilyas Nagdee said the review is ""riddled with biased thinking, errors, and plain anti-Muslim prejudice"", adding: ""Frankly, the review has no legitimacy"". The organisation also accused the author of having a ""history of biased comments on Muslims and Islam"". Mr Nagdee added: ""There's mounting evidence that Prevent has specifically targeted Muslim communities and activists fighting for social justice and a host of crucial international issues - including topics like the climate crisis and the oppression of Palestinians. ""A proper independent review of Prevent should have looked at the host of human rights violations that the programme has led to - but these have largely been passed over in silence."" Labour's Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper accused the Government of a ""missed opportunity"" to build consensus with the review. ""It has instead been mishandled,"" she added. ""The Home Secretary and the Government has not updated their counter-extremism strategy since 2015."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/governments-anti-terror-programme-failing-29166375
Eye-watering food study shows how much more goods cost at local 'convenience' stores,"Consumer group Which? compared prices at Tesco Express and Sainsbury’s Local with their larger supermarkets and online - with some shocking results when it comes to overspendingAs the cost of living continues to see wages stretched more and more each month - the rise in food costs has also made supermarket shopping a little harder for most. With some simple shopping hacks in the bag, it could mean spending less and saving more while not missing out on your fridge favourites. Consumer experts have waded in with their helpful tips on how to make out money stretch further - including the time of day you shop. The first simple tip is not to head to the supermarket on an empty stomach - which means avoiding throwing those extra few treats into your basket, that aren't really needed. If you're not too hungry while shopping, you'll be more inclined to simply get what's needed. Trying to shop around can also help. It's always easiest to get all we need from one quick stop at one store - but prices for the exact same items differ from one supermarket to the next - so checking out and comparing prices can be really helpful.   If you try shopping later in the day or the evening, you might also be lucky in picking up some bargains on reduced items which might need shifting from the shelves that day. While we're all drawn in by those reduced stickers, the special offer bargains can also be hugely tempting - but they might not always save you money.  Often the special offers will be advertised on something you don't really need. So try not to get excited about offers if they're not all that necessary - you could end up actually spending more. When it comes to choices of what gets thrown into the trolley, trying to pack in more veggies and less meat and fish can help, although a balanced diet is needed and meat can be swapped out for other proteins, like beans or chick peas. Also, if you're looking for staples including herbs, spices, tinned goods, dips or sauces, then heading to the world food aisle could cut the cost as lesser known brands are sold cheaper - and sometimes tastier!, writes the Cash Lady.  The tips will come in useful for families who use supermarket convenience stores after new research shows they could be paying around £800 a year over the odds. Consumer group Which? compared prices at Tesco Express and Sainsbury’s Local with their larger supermarkets and online. It discovered people buying the same 75 items at Tesco Express, including Anchor Spreadable Butter, a Hovis white loaf and own-brand milk, would be spending an average £15.73 extra a week – £817.91 a year – than those shopping online or at a larger Tesco store. At Sainsbury’s, Which? researchers compared the prices of 69 groceries, including Heinz tomato soup, McVitie’s biscuits and Birds Eye Potato Waffles. They found shoppers using Sainsbury’s Local instead of going online or to a larger store would have spent an extra £477.93 over the year.  Which? acknowledged that grocery prices fluctuate but said its analysis revealed big mark-ups at both Sainsbury’s Local and Tesco Express. Head of food policy Sue Davies said: “Shopping at a supermarket convenience shop comes at a cost.” Sainsbury’s said: “Our Local stores are in city or town centre locations and operating costs are higher.” Tesco said: “We work hard to ensure our customers get great value online, in a large store or in an Express store.""

'I make £600 extra a year from letting people use my parking space – here's how',"A woman who lives in Cambridge has shared how she makes between £30-50 a week just from renting her car parking space out to complete strangers. Here's how she does it With the Cost of Living crisis, many people are having to think of smart ways to make and save money. Many people have 'side hustles', which means they have alternative ways of making money outside their main job. One woman has shared how she can make £30-50 a month just by renting out her parking space. Christine Pearl, who has a large parking space in Perry Court in Cambridge, rents it on the YourParkingSpace website. Christine, who has been using the website to rent out her space since 2018, can make as much as £600 with the low-effort side hustle.   She explained to YourParkingSpace: ""A friend of mine told me about it – it seemed like a simple idea with very little effort involved. ""My main aim was to make some extra money as I was doing small part-time administration jobs being paid hourly, so the idea of making a small income but not actually having to do anything seemed like a lightbulb moment."" Every time a car parked on her driveway she felt like she had ""won a prize"", and she added: ""I couldn't help thinking about the dull admin task I had just undertaken in the same hour and all I had to do was look at a car in front of my house for the same amount of money"".  In addition to renting out her parking space, Caroline has also started a business selling vintage things online. Earning money from renting out her space means she can buy ""lots of items at auction"", which generates even more online. Caroline thinks her parking space is popular because the city ""has very expensive parking or offers residential parking only"". She added: ""I typically generate £30-£50 a month and made over a few hundred pounds in 2022, but anything over £0 is a bonus to me since I'm normally paid hourly. ""I would recommend renting out your space as there is no need to have a big driveway, just one parking space. You can monetise an empty space for minimal effort.""   Caroline recommends assessing your parking space and making sure it's ""clear and easy for someone to park in"". She added: ""Don't dismiss it if you are not near a town centre - people always need parking to go to concerts, schools, universities, hospitals, meetings, transport links and many more! Use this to your advantage – think local amenities not just central."" Harrison Woods, CEO at YourParkingSpace added: ""The cost of living crisis has never been more of an issue, with bills, food, and car parking charges rising in certain areas across the UK. While it is well known that having a driveway or a parking space in a great location can add value to a property, many people are choosing to take advantage of their spaces by renting them out in order to make some extra income.

WHO warns 'we must prepare' for bird flu pandemic if mammal strain jumps to humans,"WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has urged world leaders to be vigilant and monitor bird flu cases in mammals after the disease was found to have spread to ottersThe world could be facing its second pandemic in three years as the threat of bird flu rises, the World Health Organisation has warned.  Public health experts say the most recent strain has been found to have jumped from birds to mammals, with reports of the H5N1 strain found in otters, foxes and mink. If the strain jumps to humans, the world could face potentially another pandemic on its hands. Meanwhile, Covid-19 still presenting in hospitals and causing deaths. In a virtual briefing, WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged leaders to take action and monitor the virus where it is suspected in mammals. While the risk to humans remained low, he said, nations must be on their guard and stay prepared for any outcome.   The H5N1 strain was first confirmed in the UK on a poultry farm near King's Lynn, Norfolk, in November, according to the Government. The current ongoing outbreak has been described as the UK's largest ever and has contributed to poultry farmers losing 40% of free-range turkey flocks, according to Richard Griffiths, the chief executive of the British Poultry Council. H5N1 has been known to spread to humans, however this is rare and usually due to close contact with dead infected birds. Health experts say that humans must remain vigilant, as risk of the disease spreading to human populations remains a possibility and a risk until the current outbreak is brought under control.

ISIS jihadi medical student who wants to return to UK says he has 'right to come home',"Ibrahim Ageed was studying medicine in Sudan before he joined the ISIS terror group with his brother back in 2015 - and now he is pleading to return to the UKA British former medical student who went to Syria to joining ISIS claims he has the “right” to return to the UK. Ibrahim Ageed, 29, was studying at the University of Medical Sciences and Technology (UMST) in Sudan before he joined the terror group back in 2015, along with his brother Mohamed. Originally from Leicester, he is currently being held at Al-Sina Prison in Al-Hasakah, northeastern Syria. But Ibrahim has now made a new plea to be brought back to Britain, saying he has the right to be back in the country - even if he is immediately hauled before the courts. He told The News Movement: ""I believe I'll be subjected to the justice system but I'm ready to face the music and I believe it's my right basically to go back home."" The Guardian reported in 2017 that Ageed's Dad has always argued that there is no evidence that his sons have ever volunteered to fight and therefore should not be considered terrorists.   He told the Observer at the time the family believe his sons attempted to travel to Syria ""purely for humanitarian reasons"". Describing the shape of the Islamic State group in 2023, Ibrahim claimed they had been “significantly weakened."" He continued: ""Whether they have the ability to resurge or not. I'm not sure I've been completely, I've been completely isolated for like nearly four years now."" A doctor's son and a former pupil at the fee-paying Loughborough Grammar School, he told journalist Lucy Marley that he now had a wife, who he had met during his time with ISIS when they were both 23.  But of the nearly 1,000 Britons who upped travelled to Syria, Shamima Begum, who was 15 at the time, is the name who stands out for most.  She was found by journalist Anthony Lloyd in a camp in 2019 after the so-called Islamic State lost the ground war in Syria. In this first interview, she appeared to show no remorse for allegedly aiding and abetting the militant group, which infuriated Britons and ultimately led to the stripping of her British citizenship. Now aged 23 and confined in a camp in northern Syria, Ms Begum recently told the BBC that she knows the public now see her ""as a danger, as a risk, as a potential risk to them, to their safety, to their way of living"". But she said that ""I'm not this person that they think I am"".  She also admitted to joining a terrorist group and that she had been ""relieved"" to make it out of the UK with an expectation at the time of never returning. In October, a British woman and her child were repatriated from a Syrian camp. It was the first time an adult has been allowed to come back to the UK from detention in the country. It is estimated about 60 Britons, including 35 children, are being held in indefinite detention in Syria. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/isis-jihadi-medical-student-who-29170173
"Miracle moment girl, 9, rescued uninjured from Turkey earthquake rubble as mum missing","As the rescue efforts continue in rubble-strewn Antakya, the heroes trying to save lives in Turkey can take heart after a pig-tailed nine-year-old was carried to safety this morningA small smile on her bewildered face, her tiny pink socks and sweater seemingly unmarked, a nine-year-old girl is carried uninjured from the rubble of her home this morning after 60 hours trapped there. Rescued from the “Armageddon” of rubble strewn Antakya in Turkey, the pig-tailed child is passed from rescue worker to rescue worker, her chubby arm wrapping around each of their necks in turn. They clap at the miracle in their arms as she is zigzagged down the mound of collapsed buildings, smiling in astonishment, their relief at a rare rescue success amid mounting bodies palpable as they stare in disbelief and ruffle her hair. Her 13-year-old brother and father followed unharmed too, but her mother was yet to be found. British aid worker Atiqur Rahman from Stoke-On-Trent works for Global Relief Trust and filmed the scene unfolding early this morning.   “It’s Armageddon here, “ he described. “Now it’s 64/65 hours since the earthquake, the chances of people coming out alive is very low. ""But you have these amazing cases where because the foundations have gone on top of one another, the buildings have collapsed layer by layer, people manage to get into gaps. “There was some noise coming from this family under the rubble, and some relatives stood outside as they knew the family was there. “When they were carried out they were conscious and moving, obviously traumatised, but physically they were unharmed. One of our guys carried them out and the girl was responding to him. “We get overwhelmed as soon as there is one case of good news. One guy has done a 28-hour shift and he said ‘We have pulled out seven alive but 100 bodies’, so with those kinds of odds everyone celebrates every person alive.  “Each case takes two to four, five hours, to get through to people.” Atiqur found himself in Syria working for Global Relief Trust when the earthquake struck on Monday. After assessing the scene there and hearing the situation in Antakya was worse, he travelled to the Turkish town. Very few rescue attempts he has seen have been joyful. The girl and her brother and father are a rare moment of hope as nearly 16,000 bodies have now been counted in the destruction of Monday’s earthquake after a sharp jump in the grim toll overnight.   One of the first cases he assisted after the first quake was a mother in her late thirties whose hand was trapped under a large column inside a collapsed building. Atiqur finds it hard to describe what happened, he still hasn’t processed it. “Her husband called us over. Initially we thought it was wood and thought we could cut it, but we realised there was a lot more weight than we anticipated. We were trying to use anything we could, we were trying to use car jacks just to pull her out. “The husband was saying ‘Cut the hand’, you could feel tremors. I was saying ‘There are no ambulances, if you cut the hand there is serious chance of bleeding to death’.  As we were discussing what to do a large tremor happened and we had to crawl out of that building immediately, for our own safety, the husband had children outside. “The woman was conscious. She was left behind. We don’t know what happened. Once the tremor happened there was no way of getting back in, another building next to it was tilted half way and stuff was falling down into this building, sofas, chairs, a fridge were falling onto us. “We had to make that decision. We had a split second decision to pull out and she was screaming saying ‘Don’t go, don’t go’. “He had to leave, the children were out on the streets. We were saying we would come back but obviously she was terrified. It plays in your head, what if we had tried the car jack faster…  “Then we were called to something else, it’s one after another, the aim is to try and save as many lives as you can.” The man waited nine hours for rescuers to come and pull his seven-year-old son from the rubble of their home. By the time they got there, it was too late. He and the boy’s uncle could only cradle the small body and carry the boy to a temporary morgue. And pray. British aid worker Salah Aboulgasem, 36, was by the father’s side in Gaziantep, Turkey, before rescue workers arrived, fearful to touch the rubble despite their desperation. Salah from Birmingham, who has been working tirelessly to support families since the earthquake struck, described the agony and helplessness of waiting. “You move one piece, like Jenga, all of it moves, so you have to be careful,” he explained.  “The child was very small. The family was eagerly waiting, the father for eight or nine hours for his son. The rescue team then worked with him carefully for over an hour, trying to cause less damage, moving rubble in one direction, then another. “His son was dead by the time they pulled him out. There is not much you can say at that stage, you can’t really look them in the eyes. People are grieving, it is very emotional.” Salah describes those first hours after the earthquake as “mayhem”, and can barely process what he has seen. He describes walking from mound to mound. “We are hearing voices under the rubble,” he said.  “It is still very raw and it is still happening.” A colleague 100km away in Syria explained to him there were too many bodies there to bury separately. “One colleague told me they actually - it’s shocking to say it - they are burying families in mass graves because there isn’t enough space, there are that many bodies. Multiple families are going into mass graves,” he said. “There are bodies just left on the roads, they have recovered them but there isn’t enough body bags.”  To donate visit grtuk.org ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/miracle-moment-girl-9-rescued-29166538
Lotto heiress finally builds dream mansion after row with neighbours to tear house down,"Lisa and Craig Charters wanted the transformation of their £200,000 bungalow into a £5million mansion to be featured on Kevin McCloud's tv show Grand DesignsA couple who became overnight millionaires and wanted to use their family's £33 million lotto winnings to transform their bungalow into a mega-mansion have finally got the go-ahead after a bitter row with neighbours.  Lisa and Craig Charters announced ambitious plans to transform their Edinburgh bungalow into a Hollywood-esque city pad after Lisa's parents won the jackpot six years ago. But the architects plans for the £5million renovation were slammed by other residents on the street, who formally submitted nearly 50 objections to the planning application. Details published on the city council’s planning portal reveal there were 63 public comments submitted within 21 days - 48 objections and 15 comments of support. The couple had paid £200,000 over the £670,000 asking price for the three-bedroom bungalow in the trendy city borough with views of Edinburgh Castle. Their ultra modern plans would see the original single-storey building demolished and replaced with a three-storey mansion.   The large house is set to feature a zinc exterior, five glass-fronted bedrooms and a driveway rising from the garden. The couple have even submitted an application to have the project featured on Grand Designs with Kevin McCloud. The council received an official planning application in February with their planning agents saying the building would make a “significant statement”. A source said: “This is a pretty significant and ambitious development. ""Neighbours have been notified of the plans and they have a right to have their views.”  Local councillors visited the site before making the decision at a planning meeting.  Councillor Euan Hyslop said:”I can understand why there have been a number of concerns raised by neighbouring residents.  ""But I think it is a fitting addition.

Martin Lewis warns of 'national act of harm' coming in April in stark government message,"The Money Saving Expert founder has written to the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt urging him to postpone a planned rise in energy bills. He warns another 1.7million being plunged into fuel povertyMoney Saving Expert founder Martin Lewis has urged the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to postpone April's increase in energy bills.  The consumer champion described the planned hike as a “national act of harm” which could plunge another 1.7million into fuel poverty in the coming months.  In a letter to the Chancellor he said the increase was no longer necessary because wholesale prices have ""come down very substantially"".  He added: ""Postponing the increase is a practical and fair decision, with household energy bills already double what they were the prior winter.  “Crucially the damage to people’s pockets and mental health of another round of energy price rise letters is disproportionate.""  Under the Government's ""energy price guarantee"" typical bills are frozen at an average of £2,500 - but will soon become less generous.  In November the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced the cap will be increased to £3,000 for the average household in April.   There are also no plans by the Government to extend a £400 payment made available to all households across the country this winter.  But speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme Mr Lewis said: “The nation is already shivering with the damage of the cost-of-living crisis and it just seems to me there is no need to do this.  “I would ask the Chancellor to postpone this rise”.  He added: ""To put this national act of harm of increasing the price guarantee for just three months, to throw another 1.7million people into fuel poverty taking it to 8.4 million, it seems unnecessary.""  Mr Lewis said any cancellation would have to happen before the March Budget because by then people will have had letters telling them their bills are going up.  Describing energy prices as ""effictively nationalised"", he added: ""This is the one price mechanism that is fully in the Government’s control and it is choosing to put it up on 1 April.""  Labour's Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the personal finance expert ""is right"".  She added: ""We need to stop bills going up in April.  "" That's why Labour would freeze energy prices - paid for by extending the one-off tax on energy companies making windfall profits from war."" Last month Ms Reeves urged Rishi Sunak to cancel the rise in April as she accused the Prime Minister of ""burying his head in the sand"" as the cost of living soars.She highlighted that many families are looking at a 40% increase in their bills, adding: ""At the same time, energy companies continue to enjoy record profits. This cannot be right."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/breaking-martin-lewis-warns-national-29170850
Sky to hike broadband and TV prices by 8.1% - adding £67 a year to bills,"Sky is the latest TV and broadband provider to confirm price hikes for this spring, with other providers including BT and EE hiking costs by up to 14.4% - but there are ways to cut your costsSky is hiking its broadband and TV prices by 8.1% on average for millions of customers - adding more than £67 a year to bills.  The telecoms giant has only provided the average price rise - meaning customers could end up seeing a bigger or smaller increase. How much exactly your bill will rise by depends on what you’re currently paying. An increase of 8.1% would add £5.60 to the average monthly bill, Sky said - or £67.20 extra over 12 months. Sky said it will start notifying customers from February 16, with the price change coming into effect from April. Customers who are signed up to a Sky social tariff - which offer cheaper rates for households on benefits - won't be affected by the price increases. Sky Glass and Stream customers who are in contract also won't see their bills rise while they are still in their contract period.  A Sky spokesperson said: ""This is not a decision we have taken lightly. “We have tried to minimise the impact to customers with an average price increase across all our broadband and TV customers of 8.1%, which is below levels of inflation again this year. “Competitors’ average increase over the last two years has been nearly double Sky’s average increase over the same period.” If you’re not happy with the price rises and you're outside your contract, you will be able to leave your Sky deal without paying an exit fee. Sky broadband and home phone customers who are in contract can also leave penalty-free within 30 days of being told about the price increases. If you're tied into a Sky TV contract, you won't be able to leave without paying an exit fee - but you could still try haggling for a better deal.  The latest increases come after Sky announced it would increase prices for its out-of-contract mobile customers by 9% this month.  Sky is the latest TV and broadband provider to confirm price hikes for this spring - with other providers including BT and EE hiking costs by up to 14.4%. Under current rules, telecom companies are allowed to increase prices mid-contract in line with inflation, plus roughly 4% extra on top of this. The rate of Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation for December or Retail Price Index (RPI) for January are normally used to decide these price rises.  CPI inflation was 10.5% for December and some companies will increase bills by this amount, plus an additional 3.9% on top.   You can see a full list of broadband and phone price rises here.    How to cut the cost of your broadband and mobile bill  If your mobile or broadband bill is about to get more expensive, you might be able to cut costs. If you're out of contract, you're free to leave and go elsewhere - or maybe you want to haggle down your current provider. There is also no harm in trying to haggle if you're still in contract. The first thing you should do, is compare prices elsewhere to see what other deals are available. You'll normally find SIM-only plans are the cheapest. You can compare prices by using comparison websites such as MoneySupermarket and Uswitch. Take a look at how many minutes, texts and how much data you currently use, so you can find similar plans that suit your needs. You may find you're actually paying too much right now for allowances that you're not using. When haggling, explain the better deals you've seen elsewhere then ask if the company can match or beat that price. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/sky-hike-broadband-tv-prices-29171045
First firefighters strike in 20 years called off after new pay deal offered,"A national firefighters' strike has been put on hold as members of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) consider a new pay deal after a previous offer was described as ""insulting""The first national firefighters' strike in 20 years has been postponed after union members received an offer for a new pay deal. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said on Thursday morning that they will not announce any strike dates while a ballot on the offer takes place. The proposed national strike would be the first to take place in the UK since 2003 and dates were due to be announced today. The union had warned of strikes if a previous 5% pay offer was not increased following a huge 88% vote in favour of industrial action. Members had rejected a previous offer of a 2% rise, which union bosses branded ""insulting"". The FBU said it will have an “honest and sober” discussion of the new offer, adding it still amounts to a real-terms pay cut given the rate of inflation. Matt Wrack, FBU general secretary, said: “This offer is testament to the power of collective action through the Fire Brigades Union. “Last year we were offered an insulting 2%. The employers have now revised their position.   “We have achieved this increase because of the massive vote in favour of strike action by firefighters and control staff across the country, which made clear the strength of feeling among firefighters about cuts to their wages."" He added that the average firefighter has lost ""at least 12% of the value of their pay"" since 2010, and the latest offer still amounts to a ""real-terms pay cut"". In December, the FBU contrasted the pay of top fire chiefs with that of a “competent wholetime firefighter” who is paid £32,244. Mr Wrack commented: ""Chief fire officers are not worth six times more than firefighters - it was the latter who were called key workers during the pandemic delivering vital services, including moving the bodies of the deceased."" He said that firefighters were ""increasingly facing real in-work poverty"", including having to use foodbanks and take on additional jobs to afford household basics.

Facebook posts justifying Russia's invasion of Ukraine viewed more than 1.2billion times,"Russian internet trolls are targeting social media posts - Western officials are monitoring other countries where the dangerous messages are gaining more interestFacebook content justifying Russia’s invasion of Ukraine made by disinformation trolls has been viewed more than 1.2billion times globally, sources have warned. Western officials are monitoring the countries where the dangerous messages are gaining more interest. A source said the propaganda is ""low quality"" but could threaten UK national security if harmful narratives are amplified by other leaders around the world. An official said Russian internet trolls based in St Petersburg are targeting content on Ukraine but also posts related to “controversial issues” in other countries.   They said trolling is particularly a problem on Instagram, Facebook and parts of YouTube and Twitter.    The comment sections of newspaper sites are also targeted. Western officials said: “It's designed to distract audiences from the truth of the atrocities that have taken place in Ukraine and also to fuel conspiracy theories.” They said Russian disinformation tactics have historically “tried to split elements of society against each other or split countries from each other”.  Officials are keeping “a very close eye” and working “to counter” narratives in some countries where there are “mixed” views on Russia ’s invasion.  Sources said attempts “to split Ukrainians against each other” have “failed”. “It's only managed to bring them all together,” they said. “Russia's goal here is to break the Ukrainian will to resist. It's absolutely failed on every conceivable measure,” they said.  The warnings on disinformation came as both sides gear up for an expected Spring offensive as the first anniversary of Moscow’s invasion looms on February 24. Western officials said: “Our Ukrainian colleagues now describe what's happening in information manipulation as information trench warfare, again mirroring the language around the war on the ground.”  In an address to Parliament on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said victory against Russia will deter aggressors around the world.  The wartime leader told parliamentarians gathered in Westminster Hall: ""We know freedom will win. We know Russia will lose. ""And we really know that the victory will change the world and this will be a change that the world has long needed.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/facebook-posts-justifying-russias-invasion-29166118
Vladimir Putin issues chilling warning to UK over giving fighter jets to Ukraine,"The Russian Embassy in London issued a statement saying there would be 'military and political ramifications for the European continent and the entire globe' if the UK provides warplaneVladimir Putin has issued a chilling warning to the UK over its prospective plans to provide Ukraine with fighter jets to defend its country from Russian invaders.  Ukrainian president Volodomyr Zelensky reiterated his request for the airpower in a speech to the UK parliament on Wednesday.  But the Russian Embassy in London was quick to respond, issuing a statement warning the British government that a decision to provide the warplanes would be ""on London's conscience"" because of the ""bloodshed, next round of escalation, and subsequent military and political ramifications for the European continent and the entire globe"". The UK has not yet committed to providing the fighter jets to Ukraine, but on Wednesday Prime Minister Rishi Sunak insisted that ""nothing was off the table"" in his discussions with Zelensky.  Speaking during a joint press conference with the Ukrainian president, Mr Sunak said sending warplanes was “part of the conversation” between the pair.   Earlier in the day, Zelensky presented the speaker of the House of Commons with a helmet from the Ukrainian air force inscribed by a pilot with the words: ""We have freedom. Give us wings to protect it."" He told peers and MPs in Westminster Hall: “I appeal to you and the world with simple and yet most important words: combat aircraft for Ukraine, wings for freedom.”  Downing Street confirmed the Prime Minister had asked Defence Secretary Ben Wallace to investigate what jets the UK could potentially give to Ukraine in its struggle against invading Russian forces. Mr Zelensky said that without jets, there was a risk of “stagnation” in the conflict with Russia. Boris Johnson, who was prime minister at the outbreak of the conflict and a close ally of Mr Zelensky, urged the UK to give Ukraine the “tools to finish the job” of defeating the Kremlin’s troops.   “The faster we do it, the bigger the saving in life,” he told LBC. Mr Zelensky's surprise visit to the UK included a meeting with King Charles III.  Alluding to the King's former RAF experience, the Ukrainian president told those gathered in Westminster Hall: “The King is an air force pilot and in Ukraine today, every air force pilot is a king.” He added: “We know freedom will win. We know Russia will lose.” After visiting a training site for Ukranian troops in Dorset, Mr Sunak and Mr Zelensky later signed a declaration of unity, stating how London and Kyiv were “confident, that together with our allies and partners, we will defeat Russia’s illegal and unprovoked invasion”. The visit was only Mr Zelensky's second foreign trip outside of Ukraine since the invasion began just under a year ago.

Mum BANNED from son's school after row with headteacher over dinner lady,"Kerry Riley has taken son Tjay out of Knutton St Mary's Academy in Stoke after a row over a dinner lady she had 'issues' with spiralled out of hand and saw her banned from school premisesA mum says she has been banned from her son's school after storming into the head's office like a ""momma bear"" over a dinner lady row. Kerry Riley admits calling son Tjay's headteacher ""a few names under the sun"" following the argument over the lunchtime staff member, the exact cause of which she has not revealed.  But after the 29-year-old from Stoke brought Tjay, eight, into school the next morning, she found she was barred from stepping foot on the premises. Kerry said she had been gearing herself up to apologise when she was kicked off the grounds at Knutton St Mary's Academy in the city. “I basically told the headteacher that he had the rest of the week to sort things out or I would end up dragging the dinner lady out myself,"" Kerry told Stoke-on-Trent Live. ""I did call him a few names under the sun.""   She added: ""When I went into school the next morning he then pulled me aside. ""He said ‘You’ve not received your email, you’re not allowed on the premises'."" The email revealed that the school had ""concerns"" over Kerry's recent behaviour on the site, adding her ""aggressive manner"", ""threatening language"" and ""swearing"" towards staff had led the school to issue the three-month ban. Kerry added: “They're classing it as a threat that I had stated I would 'pull her out of school myself'. I was thinking it was a joke. I have issues with this dinner lady. “I’d previously spoken to them nicely about it and they had made a verbal agreement. The school basically agreed that they would keep her away from him. Then, he came out on two separate days saying she’d approached him and spoken to him.” Tjay is now off school, despite head teacher Paul Berridge saying arrangements could be made to drop and collect him at the school gates. “It’s one of them, he’s my son, he’s my responsibility to make sure he goes in. You can’t see the door that he goes in and out of.  ""My son’s currently not in school. I‘m a single parent. At the minute he’s missing out on school. He got upset this morning, he’s upset about not being around his friends.” Knutton St Mary's Academy said it would not tolerate ""threats of physical violence"" and ""abusive language"" towards staff. Headteacher Mr Berridge said: ""As a rule, we do not usually comment on individual cases. However, I wish to reassure you that we take the safeguarding of pupils very seriously at Knutton St Mary’s. ""What we are not prepared to accept is threats of physical violence and inappropriate abusive language towards staff. In such situations a banning order may be issued to a parent. ""Separate arrangements are made to ensure that the child can continue to be brought to school and dropped off and picked up at the gate, as is the case in this instance.""

"Lottery winner caught in the act stealing £15,000 of shoes - from his own bosses","David Swatman won £100,000 from a scratchcard in 2018 - but has pleaded guilty to stealing £15,000 worth of trainers while working as a delivery driver for FootAsylumA delivery driver who previously landed a £100,000 lottery windfall was caught thieving £15,000 worth of shoes. David Swatman was able to walk free from court despite admitting to stealing the trainers haul from his employer FootAsylum. The 43-year-old from Keighley, West Yorkshire, won the small fortune on a scratch card in 2018, and vowed to use the cash to follow his beloved Liverpool FC. But during his job delivering parcels for the footwear store, Swatman repeatedly swiped boxes for himself, a court heard.  He escaped an immediate prison sentence on Wednesday after admitting a single charge of theft worth £15,450 from between August and September 2020. Daniel Lister, prosecuting, told Manchester crown court the charge covered a series of thefts where Swatman would take boxes of trainers and give them to a third party during runs from the company's depot in Broughton, north Wales, to its base in Manchester.   His pilfering came to light when the company discovered a discrepancy in the number of boxes leaving the depot and those arriving in Manchester, the Manchester Evening News reports. Mr Lister said five boxes and two bags full of trainers never arrived and a review of CCTV revealed Swatman had made an ""unauthorised stop"" at the wheel, when the items were transferred into another vehicle. A further probe found Swatman had made various other stops on two other dates before handing over boxes. Police arrested him and, when Swatman was interviewed, he admitted the thefts and estimated he had stolen about 22 boxes, each one containing trainers worth up to £1,000.  The court heard the defendant had memorised an 'encryption lock' on the vehicles to carry out his crimes. The court was told Swatman had 22 sets of previous convictions covering 44 offences, including a drink drive offence said to have been committed shortly after the FootAsylum thefts. Max Saffman, defending, said his client was now working part-time as a window fitter earning about £300 per week, although he hoped to be working full time soon. He pointed to his client's admission of guilt from the moment he was arrested.  The judge, His Honour Judge Field KC, expressed astonishment that it had taken more than two years to bring the case to court when the defendant had admitted his crime at the outset.  He said the delay had been ""extraordinary"" and meant the defendant had been living with the threat of jail throughout his wait to be sentenced. Judge Field said: ""It wasn't just one theft. It was a series of thefts that occurred as long ago as the late summer of 2020 when you were working as a delivery driver for FootAsylum. ""You used your privileged position to steal goods from your delivery vehicle for the benefit of others... It was a breach of the trust placed in you by your employers."" The judge said there had been a ""degree of sophistication"" although the defendant had not acted alone. The goods had ""plainly been stolen to order"". But Judge Field said the defendant had shown ""genuine remorse"" and had made ""frank admissions as soon as you were confronted"". He said Swatman had ""taken steps to address the problems that may have led you to make the very bad decision to steal from your employer"". The judge went on: ""I have formed the strong view by what you have achieved over the last two-and-a-half years that there is a realistic prospect of rehabilitation in your case."" Swatman was handed a 20 month jail sentence suspended for two years. He was also ordered to carry out five days of rehabilitation activity, to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and pay £425 prosecution costs. In 2018, it was widely reported that Swatman won £100,000 on a scratchcard and that he planned to use the money to follow his football team, Liverpool. He said at the time: ""I’ve followed Liverpool all my life but because of my job, I often have to work weekends and can’t see them play as often as I would like to. Thanks to this win, I can treat not only myself but my friends as well. ""Who knows, I could even get tickets to the Champions League final in Kiev if Liverpool make it there!""

Nicola Bulley partner 'holds head in hands' as divers fail to find missing dog walker,"Paul Ansell was seen on the river bank wearing a big black puffer jacket to protect him against the cold February air and trainers, while looking in the river with the dive expertMissing woman Nicola Bulley's frustrated partner looked a picture of despair as he visited the river bank in the continuing search for the mum-of-two. Paul Ansell cast a dejected figure as he stood at the water's edge yesterday, and at one point was witnessed holding his head in his hands. Mr Ansell, who has been trying to stay strong for Nicola's two young daughters, joined expert dive specialist Paul Faulding at the river in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire. Wearing a big black puffer jacket to protect him against the cold February air and trainers, Paul - who originally met Nicola in a pub 12 years ago - was observing the river alongside the expert.  At one point Mr Ansell could be seen waving his arms around as he talked, before Mr Faulding pointed over at something on the bank and the pair were seen staring over.  At another stage Mr Ansell could be seen in a police incident support van, accompanied by a detective and in animated conversation. Mr Faulding, who has dealt with similar missing person hunts, believes if the missing 45-year-old mum was in the river, he would have found her.  He said: ""I don’t think she fell in the water."" He told breakfast show host Nick Ferrari on LBC: ""That's just my opinion with all the drownings I've dealt with over the years.   ""They normally go down and the police dive team are brilliant, they know what they're doing, professional, they would have found her, as we would've done.  ""We locate people quickly. That's what I'm shocked with, that she's disappeared."" After being seen with Mr Ansell, the dive boss said Nicola's partner was ""clearly upset"". ""He was stunned, really. He just wants to know where his partner is. He’s an upset man,"" he added. ""The family just wanted to come up and talk to me and see progress and how we’d done and Paul wanted to go up to the bench again to see the area. ""I walked up with Paul and explained to him this is where we’ve searched and I told Paul that we’d cleared from the weir up to about another mile up river, a long way up the river."" Mr Faulding, who runs search group Specialist Group International, arrived to much media fanfare as he carried out a sonar sweep this week. But he pulled out with his firm yesterday with their efforts having failed to produce anything in relation to the missing dog walker.  There has been no trace of Nicola since she vanished while walking her dog on Friday, January 27. Her phone was found on a bench by the waterside and had recently connected to a work call. Her dog Willow was running loose. Police launched an extensive search of the area and said their ""main working hypothesis"" was that she fell in a river but a body has never been found.  Nicola had dropped her two daughters, aged six and nine, off at school and then gone on her usual dog walk alongside the river before she disappeared. Mr Faulding told TalkTV yesterday: ""After 25 years of doing this kind of work, after hundreds of cases, I am well and truly baffled. ""Normally you would expect the divers to find them easily. The police have nothing to go on. ""All they have is a mobile phone at the moment and they said it could possibly be a decoy."" Mr Faulding's continued comments on the case drew flak from Lancashire Constabulary, with the force seeking to make clear that the diver had not been party to all the details of their wider investigation.

Essex earthquake wakes up locals with tremor 'that sounded like a bomb',"Residents in Essex have talked of hearing a sound ""like a bomb"" in the early hours of this morning with houses shaking due to an earthquake confirmed by the British Geological SocietyLocals woke up to a sound ""like a bomb"" as an earthquake rocked a UK country early this morning. The British Geological Society has now confirmed a minor tremor shook the ground near Chelmsford at around 5am today. A person in South Woodham Ferrers said that their whole house shook, while another heard the radiators shaking inside their home and it was also described as ""sounding like a bomb"". One further claimed it ""was like an underground train going under our bungalow"" and a resident said it felt ""like a piece of large furniture had fallen over"". Were you affected by the Essex earthquake? Contact webnews@mirror.co.uk The earthquake registered a magnitude of 2.6 and a depth of 8km at its epicentre in Bicknacre today at 5.05am.    People from Bicknacre, Runwell and South Woodham Ferrers have all reported it as well as further afield. One person shortly after 5am tweeted: ""Could it have been an earthquake or was it more likely sonic boom? I heard a loud boom/bang like noise just before the house shook."" Darren, from South Woodham Ferrers told BBC Essex: “It was just after five this morning there was a very loud bang. It was very strange and my son shot out of bed as well and we were both looking at one another going, “what was that? ""I thought we were getting broken into … and there were a few other neighbours out in the street just wondering their heads, giving it, so we all heard it."" There were reports of people feeling the earthquake in many areas including Billericay, West Hanningfield and Great Baddow.   A person tweeted: ""Felt in Billericay. Very minor vibrations, but was fairly loud! I guess when it's so quiet just after 5am, any noise feels louder than it actually is."" But one local resident did tweet that they didn't feel a thing, saying: ""I appear to have slept right through it."" A magnitude of between 2.5 and 5.4 means an earthquake is often felt, but only causes minor damage. Last year parts of the UK were rattled this morning by a 5.1 earthquake. People reported their homes were ""rattling"" for minutes as the tremors were felt in parts of northern Scotland on March 21, 2022.

The staff impacted by the decision to close the ""mini-markets"" are to be offered alternative roles in nearby stores, so no jobs will be lost as a result.  B&Q said the decision was made after an ""intensive review"" of the test format.  Going forward the DIY chains strategy director Chris Bargate said it will now focus on their smaller high street stores, B&Q locals, with a plan to expand further.   Chris added: “Our ‘test and learn’ approach is an important part of building our strategy, and our aim to create consistent, small store format blueprints that can be scaled further across the UK. “We’re continually listening to our customers and colleagues to take learnings to evolve the shopping experience in these smaller stores. “We value the contribution and the commitment from our colleagues at the concession stores.” An Asda spokesperson said the proposition between the chains had been ""well received"" by customers and Asda will use the lessons learned to ""help inform its wider concessions strategy."" B&Q's eight locations set to shut are:  Sheffield Drakehouse  Dagenham  Roehampton  Edmonton  Thurmaston  Great Bridge  Lancaster  Hartlepool  The two popular chains teamed up in 2020 in response to changes in shoppers' behaviours during the Covid-19 pandemic which saw people tie multiple shops into one single trip. The first compact B&Q stores opened up across four Asda superstores and contained a large number of B&Q's usual products, such as paint, tools,m hardware and other DIY essentials.  Customers were also able to shop for B&Q’s full range online and order selected items for collection from the B&Q concessions sites.  The first two sites opened in Dagenham and Sheffield, and the last sites to open were in Hartlepool and Great Bridge in December 2021.  The DIY retailer has opened two new B&Q locals in London's Palmers Green and Camden districts this year.  These stores were the first to adopt the B&Q Local name.  In early 2022, B&Q launched an online marketplace where shoppers could access goods from third-party suppliers, the marketplace is available both on its website and on its mobile app. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/bq-closing-eight-locations-weeks-29171729
Mum found dead in shallow grave after police find blood splatters at her home,"Luz Hernandez, a teacher and mum-of-three, was found buried in a shallow grave in Kearny, a semi-desolate industrial area in New Jersey, US, after police went to her home for a welfare checkA nursery teacher has been found dead and buried in a shallow grave a day after she was reported missing by her employer. Authorities recovered the body of Luz Hernandez, 33, in a remote part of a New Jersey town in the US after police were called for a welfare check at her home. She was exhumed by ""what appeared to be a shallow grave,"" in Kearny, a semi-desolate industrial area in New Jersey, and was pronounced dead at the scene, a statement from the prosecutor’s office read. Hernandez was a mother of three and a teacher and a teacher at BelovED Charter School. Authorities said her death is ""considered suspicious,"" while an investigation into her murder and an autopsy is ongoing. Police also found ""blood splatters"" on the door of her apartment.

  Hernandez did not show up to work on Monday, prompting her employer to contact the police, the Hudson County Prosecutor’s Office said. She started working at the school after graduating from Saint Peter’s University in 2017, according to NJ.com. She initially worked as a teacher’s assistant. The founder of the school praised the woman as a ""wonderful"" and ""beloved"" teacher. Bret Schunder said of Hernandez: ""People loved her. She was a wonderful co-worker. She was a beloved member of the BelovED family. People are feeling devastated by this.""  Schundler added that the school would do whatever it could to support her family. The school was closed Wednesday as a gesture to honour Hernandez's loss. Hernandez's family was left devastated and ""heartbroken"" by the news.  ""We love her, her family, the friends. She was an amazing girl and it’s so unfair somebody takes away the life from her. Why?"" said a cousin who didn't wish to be identified, NBC New York reported.  ""She was one of the best teachers, everybody loves her, all the kids. It’s just like, so complicated to think about this. We just want justice."" The Hudson County Prosecutor’s Office Homicide Unit, the Jersey City Police Department and the Kearny Police Department are continuing to investigate her death. The prosecutor's office did not say what evidence led them to the grave.  Further details on the circumstances under which she died were not released, and no suspect has been arrested as of yet. Authorities called anyone with information that may assist the investigation to contact the Office of the Hudson County Prosecutor at (+1)201-915-1345.

Vladimir Putin issues chilling warning to UK over giving fighter jets to Ukraine,"The Russian Embassy in London issued a statement saying there would be 'military and political ramifications for the European continent and the entire globe' if the UK provides warplaneVladimir Putin has issued a chilling warning to the UK over its prospective plans to provide Ukraine with fighter jets to defend its country from Russian invaders.  Ukrainian president Volodomyr Zelensky reiterated his request for the airpower in a speech to the UK parliament on Wednesday.  But the Russian Embassy in London was quick to respond, issuing a statement warning the British government that a decision to provide the warplanes would be ""on London's conscience"" because of the ""bloodshed, next round of escalation, and subsequent military and political ramifications for the European continent and the entire globe"". The UK has not yet committed to providing the fighter jets to Ukraine, but on Wednesday Prime Minister Rishi Sunak insisted that ""nothing was off the table"" in his discussions with Zelensky.  Speaking during a joint press conference with the Ukrainian president, Mr Sunak said sending warplanes was “part of the conversation” between the pair.   Earlier in the day, Zelensky presented the speaker of the House of Commons with a helmet from the Ukrainian air force inscribed by a pilot with the words: ""We have freedom. Give us wings to protect it."" He told peers and MPs in Westminster Hall: “I appeal to you and the world with simple and yet most important words: combat aircraft for Ukraine, wings for freedom.”  Downing Street confirmed the Prime Minister had asked Defence Secretary Ben Wallace to investigate what jets the UK could potentially give to Ukraine in its struggle against invading Russian forces. Mr Zelensky said that without jets, there was a risk of “stagnation” in the conflict with Russia. Boris Johnson, who was prime minister at the outbreak of the conflict and a close ally of Mr Zelensky, urged the UK to give Ukraine the “tools to finish the job” of defeating the Kremlin’s troops.   “The faster we do it, the bigger the saving in life,” he told LBC. Mr Zelensky's surprise visit to the UK included a meeting with King Charles III.  Alluding to the King's former RAF experience, the Ukrainian president told those gathered in Westminster Hall: “The King is an air force pilot and in Ukraine today, every air force pilot is a king.” He added: “We know freedom will win. We know Russia will lose.” After visiting a training site for Ukranian troops in Dorset, Mr Sunak and Mr Zelensky later signed a declaration of unity, stating how London and Kyiv were “confident, that together with our allies and partners, we will defeat Russia’s illegal and unprovoked invasion”. The visit was only Mr Zelensky's second foreign trip outside of Ukraine since the invasion began just under a year ago.

Tory Lee Anderson asks presenter 10 times if she's ever lied in bizarre interview,"The new deputy chairman repeatedly asked his interviewer on BBC Radio Nottingham if she had ever told a lie when she tried to ask him about a 2019 incident when he was caught persuading a pal to pretend to be an anti-Labour swing voterThe new Tory deputy chairman has clashed with a radio presenter over accusations of dishonesty in a bizarre interview. Brazen Lee Anderson repeatedly asked his interviewer on BBC Radio Nottingham if she had ever told a lie when she challenged him over a 2019 incident when he was caught persuading a pal to pretend to be an anti-Labour swing voter.  The Ashfield MP then demanded that the radio station play his 11-minute interview in full or not play it at all - or threatened that he would never work with them again. He then moaned that he was supposed to talk about his new role ""not the other stuff"" such as his rants about foodbanks or his campaign trail gaffe. Rishi Sunak promoted the divisive Tory MP in a mini reshuffle triggered by the sacking of Tory chairman Nadhim Zahawi over his tax affairs. Former Trade Minister Greg Hands, a London MP who backed Remain, was named as his replacement, with right wing Brexiteer Mr Anderson as his deputy.   Since his appointment, Mr Anderson has already sparked controversy by backing the death penalty because ""nobody has ever committed a crime after being executed"". The Prime Minister slapped him down, saying: ""That's not my view, that's not the Government's view."" And in a pre-recorded interview aired on Wednesday, Mr Anderson got into a major row with BBC presenter Verity Cowley. Ms Cowley tried to challenge him on a major gaffe in 2019 while he was out on the campaign trail with veteran reporter Michael Crick. In the footage Mr Anderson took a phone call which said was about leaflets - but his microphone picked up that he was telling a mate to pretend they didn't know eachother when he knocked at the door. Ms Cowley said: ""There is a worry by some that you might be a bit dishonest."" The Tory MP shot back: ""Have you ever told a lie Verity?"" The presenter replied: ""We're not here to talk about me. We're here to talk about you."" He retorted: ""No answer the question. Have you ever told a lie?"" Ms Cowley said: ""I'll tell you what I'm talking about when I'm talking about dishonesty - I'm talking about that video."" He interrupted: ""Have you ever told a lie? Have you ever told a lie?""  An increasingly baffled Ms Cowley said: ""We're not, we're not talking about me."" ""Have you ever told a lie,"" he demanded. She replied: ""Well I've not asked somebody to pretend to be somebody that they're not."" He said: ""Have you ever told a lie?"" She started to answer and then he said again: ""So Verity, have you ever told a lie. Yes or no answer."" Ms Cowley replied: ""What I'm saying is I've never asked somebody to pretend to be something they're not just to further my campaign.  ""I've not asked somebody to tell a lie. I am asking you if that is dishonest?"" Mr Anderson said: ""Just answer the question, please. Have you ever told a lie?"" She said: ""I mean, what do you mean? We, as humans, tell false truths to protect people."" ""So you're a liar, so you're dishonest,"" Mr Anderson replied. ""We've established you're dishonest and you tell lies."" After berating her for several minutes, he finally address the video she was asking about.  He said: ""Let's talk about that video because three weeks afterwards, I was voted in as the first-ever Conservative MP [in Ashfield], beating Labour by 8,000 votes. ""So that's what the people of Ashfield think and that's all that matters to me."" Mr Anderson told her to play the interview in full and then changed his mind and asked her not to play it at all. He said: ""I can't trust you to play to play the whole lot to live and be fair to me.  ""We're supposed to be talking about my role as Deputy Chairman not the other stuff... So don't play please. If you do, I will never I will never give you anything again."" During the interview he also doubled down on his criticism of the use of foodbanks, saying he didn't think anyone earning £30,000 to £35,000 should need one. Ms Cowley said: ""Even though nurses, firefighters, people who've got jobs are saying 'I need to use this' you don't believe them?"" ""No,"" Mr Anderson said. ""You bring them to me Verity, you get a fireman and a nurse in Ashfield and bring them to me and we'll do it on the show. ""I'd challenge you right now to find me a firefighter or a nurse in Ashfield that's using a food bank and I'll give you a year to find one.""

"Tories could be reduced to third largest party in a snap general election, survey suggests","The grim outlook for the Conervatives comes after 12 months of chaos in the party with the toppling of two Prime Ministers and resignations over sleaze allegations Rishi Sunak's Tories could be reduced to the third largest party in the Commons and almost wiped-out in a snap general election, a new survey suggests.  It comes after the Conservatives' new Chairman Greg Hands admitted on Wednesday that the upcoming local elections will be ""difficult"" for the party.  Highlighting the Tories' grim outlook after 12 months of turmoil in the party and the toppling of two Prime Ministers - Boris Johnson and Liz Truss - the poll of over 28,000 people by Find Out Now gave Labour a 26-point lead.   The survey for the Daily Telegraph by the pollsters and Electoral Calculus also suggests Mr Sunak's party would be reduced to fewer seats than the SNP.  It forecasts that Labour would gain 306 seats - giving the party a whopping Commons majority - and the SNP winning 50 parliamentary seats. The Tories would win just 45 seats - down from 365 at the 2019 general election - making them the third largest party. Read More
  Find Out Now's Chief Executive Chris Holbrook told the Daily Telegraph: ""The Conservatives have been far behind in the polls for the last four months, with little sign of improvement"". He added: “They have lost support across the country, particularly in traditionally strong Conservative areas, which bodes very badly for the next general election. ""That election could be a near-wipeout and worse than 1997, with the Conservatives not even being the main opposition party.”  But Mr Hands, who was appointed on Tuesday after the sacking of his predecessor Nadhim Zahawi, attempted to be more upbeat earlier this week.  While he said the local elections in May would be ""difficult"", he claimed the party was ""overall in good shape"" with membership and resources ""improving"".  He added: “We’re really looking forward to taking on Sir Keir Starmer ’s unreformed Labour party and the other parties as well.   “I think the Conservative party will have a really good story to tell at next year’s general election and we’re definitely looking forward to it.”  But the prospect of a snap election is remote and Mr Sunak potentially has up until 17 December 2024 - the latest Parliament can be dissolved - to announce the date for the country's next general election. In an email to Tory supporters after his appointment, Mr Hands also hinted it will be a while before the country goes to the polls. In his message sent out from Tory HQ, he said: ""The next 18 months will see us win or lose the next general election"".

Fury over government plans to meet with genocide 'mastermind' in London,"The Commons heard that Erkin Tuniyaz, governor of Xinjiang in China, plans to travel to the UK on a diplomatic passport, and could meet Whitehall officials next week - despite being branded a ""mastermind"" of the genocide of Uyghur MuslimsMPs have reacted with fury to government plans to meet a ""mastermind"" of the sickening genocide in China - amid calls for him to be sanctioned and prosecuted. The Commons heard that Erkin Tuniyaz, governor of Xinjiang, plans to travel to the UK on a diplomatic passport, and could meet Whitehall officials despite not being invited. It has been estimated that more than 1.5million Uyghurs and members of other Muslim groups have been detained in Xinjiang, sparking worldwide condemnation. Foreign Office minister Leo Docherty said he officials ""would be prepared to offer him a meeting"" - but only to make their ""abhorrence of the treatment of the Uighur people"" ""absolutely clear"".  His statement was met with disbelief, with senior Tory Alicia Kearns, fuming: ""In Xinjiang women are being forcibly sterilised, children are in concentration camps, there are forced labour camps and systemic rape, yet... the minister has just confirmed from the despatch box that ministers approved of this visit to one of the masterminds of this genocide."" Ms Kearns, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, called for him to be sanctioned and told Mr Docherty: ""I'm afraid minister this just simply is not good enough.""    Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said that the Chinese politician should be dealt with in a court of law. He said: ""Whether or not the Foreign Office is tough, this is a propaganda coup for the Chinese Government. The governor has defended the use of mass detention centres and doubled down and expanded their use.  ""During his tenure over one million Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities were detained in Xinjiang. ""I remind the minister, a man that actually declares that nothing is going on is hardy likely to be bothered by a Foreign Office official telling him 'now now, you've got to stop this'."" Sir Iain told the Commons the UK had only sanctioned ""three rather junior people"" involved in Xinjiang compared to the ""punitive sanctions"" and other actions carried out by the US.  He added: ""The place to deal with these individuals is in a tribunal or a court of law, not in the quiet office of a Foreign Office official."" And Labour shadow foreign office minister Catherine West said a meeting with the governor of Xinjiang would be ""ill-judged and inappropriate"". Ms West said: ""I'm acutely aware of and in principle agree with the general points of engagement which the minister has outlined, however, we do have to be very robust in regards to human rights."" She added: ""I fear that this planned visit to the UK highlights the serious lack of political leadership at the Foreign Office. The minister knows the views of this House and should have made it clear that this meeting was ill-judged and inappropriate."" In 2021 Parliament voted to declare the treatment of Uyghur Muslims as a genocide, although this definition has not been adopted by the Foreign Office. Mr Docherty told the Commons that Tuniyaz would not be ""dignified"" with a ministerial meeting. He said: ""We understand from the Chinese embassy that the governor of Xinjiang may visit the UK next week. ""To be very clear he has not been invited by the UK Government or by the FCDO and we have no confirmation that he will in fact travel. ""Our expectation is that he will be travelling on a diplomatic passport, and has not yet been granted, therefore, a visa. If he does visit I can assure this House that under no circumstances will he be dignified with a ministerial meeting."" No 10 has defended the meeting, with the Prime Minister's official spokesman saying: “My understanding is FCDO officials are meeting the governor of Xinjiang to make clear the UK is abhorrent over the treatments of the Uyghur people and to underline we will not relent from exposing the horrors to which they are being subjected.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/fury-over-government-plans-meet-29172900
Nicola Bulley group STOPPED from searching abandoned house in hunt for missing mum,"The group, who are believed to have travelled to Lancashire from the Liverpool area to try and search for the missing mum-of-two, were reportedly issued a dispersal order last nightPolice have reportedly stopped a group of men from going to search an abandoned house in the hunt for missing dog walker Nicola Bulley. The group, who are believed to have travelled to Lancashire from the Liverpool area, were apparently issued a dispersal order last night. It comes after police warned members of the public not to ""take the law into their own hands"" nor direct online abuse at people connected to the investigation. Lancashire Constabulary said it ""will not tolerate"" people committing criminal offences by breaking into empty or derelict riverside properties to try to find the missing mother-of-two.   And speaking from the scene on Wednesday evening, TalkTV's Oliver Whitfield-Miocic said: ""The police here have just had to issue a dispersal order to a group of men believed to have travelled down from the Liverpool area. ""They wanted to go and search this abandoned house on the other side of the river where police believe Nicola Bulley had accidentally fallen in. ""All of this despite the police already having searched that area and, only 24 hours ago, the Superintendent in charge of this investigation asking people not to take the law into their own hands.""  Ms Bulley, 45, went missing on January 27 in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire. In a press conference on Tuesday, Superintendent Sally Riley said: ""We will not tolerate online abuse of anyone, including innocent witnesses, members of the family and friends, of local businesses, or of criminal damage or burglary. ""We will be taking a strong line on that, as you would expect.""  Ms Riley also told reporters: ""There are some properties along the riverside which are empty or derelict. ""Whilst it may be well intentioned that people think that that could be a line of inquiry, I would ask them to desist from doing that. ""In some cases it may be criminal if they are breaking in and causing damage or committing a burglary."" She said officers have searched derelict riverside properties with the permission of owners.  ""Because there is no criminal element yet identified, and we don't expect there to be in this inquiry, then we're not starting to go into houses because that's not where the inquiry is leading us,"" she added. Ms Riley also urged the public to avoid ""distressing"" speculation about what might have happened to Ms Bulley. ""We would ask that people in the wider community, particularly on social media and online, do not speculate as to what may have happened to Nicola,"" she told reporters at the press conference.  ""This is particularly hurtful to her family, to her children, to her partner Paul, to her parents, her sister and her friends because it is not helpful to them, it is distressing and it is distracting for the police inquiry. ""Nor is it helpful if people, particularly if they have come from outside of the area, take it upon themselves to take the law into their own hands by trying to, for example, break into empty property. ""They may mean well, they may want to help. But they can help in thinking back if they were in the area to what information they may have of relevance to the police and holding the family in their thoughts.""  Peter Faulding, leader of underwater search experts Specialist Group International (SGI), helped to search the river after being called in by the family. Mr Faulding has said if his team does not find her in the water using his sonar equipment then he believes she has not been in the river and raised ""third party"" involvement in the disappearance. But Ms Riley told reporters at a press conference in the village that Mr Faulding is not included in ""all the investigation detail"".  She added: ""Our search has not found Nicola in the river and then a re-search in parts by SGI has found the same. That does not mean... that Nicola has not been in the river. ""In the light of other inquiries being discounted from the investigation so far... clearly our main belief is that Nicola did fall into the river. ""Clearly Mr Faulding isn't included within all the investigation detail any more than the members of the public are that I'm briefing through these sorts of press conferences.""

Dad's mutilated body left on road after 'sadistic' vigilantes bundled him into car boot,"The men have been jailed for more than 200 years for killing Christopher Hughes after they mistakenly believed he had raped a teenager in Wigan at knifepointEight men have been jailed for more than 200 years for murdering a boxer who they accused of preying on a young girl. Christopher Hughes' mutilated body was discovered on a country road near Skelmersdale, Lancashire, after he was brutally attacked in the false belief he had raped a teenager. The 37-year-old suffered nearly 100 separate injuries, having been hunted down by the vigilante gang, Liverpool ECHO reports. Seven men - one of whom ranted at the judge as they were sent down - were convicted last month of kidnapping and murder following a trial at Liverpool crown court, while an eighth admitted the same charges. Together the eight were sent down for a combined 229 years at the court on Thursday, after a judge branded the murder ""brutal"" and ""sadistic"". Curtis Balbas and Erland Spahiu had ambushed Mr Hughes in Wigan on February 18 last year, beating him to the ground before binding him, throwing him in a car boot and driving him out to a rural spot. There he was attacked with a weapon similar to a machete or a hatchet, the court heard, suffering more than 90 injuries to his head, neck, body and limbs.   The court heard both had already driven around the town's Worsley Hall estate looking for him the night before, even turning up and breaking into his house, although he wasn't in at the time. The dad was found dead by a dog walker on February 22 after he was kidnapped and murdered four days earlier. The defendants had plotted the manhunt in the mistaken belief that he had been responsible for raping a teenage girl at knifepoint behind a post office. Also jailed were Martin Smith, 34, who acted as spotter in the Audi carrying Mr Hughes, and Razgar Mohammed and Erion Voja who patrolled nearby in a Mercedes. A ""burial party"" consisting of Dean O’Neill-Davey, Spahiu, Voja and Andrius Uzkuraitis who helped dispose of Mr Hughes' body were also jailed. CCTV scoured by police showed the Audi on a road near 34-year-old Spahiu's home on the afternoon of the 18th before leaving 20 minutes later. O'Neill-Davey, Spahiu, Voja and Uzkuraitis then returned to the scene under the cover of darkness and began digging a grave on nearby wasteland. The sadistic gravediggers had brought items from Asda the night before to help bury Mr Hughes, using rubber gloves, bin bags and shovels. The men were interrupted in a stroke of luck after police were called to a nearby, unconnected crash, sending them running for cover and abandoning the burial. The gang then tried to cover their tracks, destroying CCTV, disposing of the Audi and deleting messages between them. Balbas, from Wigan, pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping and was jailed for life with a minimum term of 34 years. Seven other conspirators were found guilty of the same counts and jailed for life, namely Balbas' brothers-in-law 52-year-old Alan Jaf, 48-year-old Khalil Awla, 40-year-old Razgar Mohammed must serve at least 26, 26 and 27 years respectively. O’Neill-Davey, 30, who had worked with Jaf and Awla at a garage in the town, will spend a minimum of 25 years behind bars. Voja and Spahiu - 21-year-old cousins from Albania - were given terms of 23 and 35 years respectively. Smith, also from Wigan, was told he will serve at least 33 years. Uzkuraitis, of Wigan, was acquitted of murder and kidnapping but convicted of assisting an offender. The 27-year-old was imprisoned for six years. Smith shook his head as he was sentenced, throwing a plastic cup to the floor while Voja ranted at the judge, saying: ""I know myself. ""I'm no murderer. I'll get my justice one day you t***."" He continued his outburst after being led into the cells, where he reportedly began punching walls. Voja added: ""I don't give a f*** any more."" Mr Justice Mark Wall called the kidnapping a ""slick manoeuvre"" done in broad daylight, saying the rape allegation has ""instilled a sense of outrage"" in the men.   The judge added that, while not doubting the girl had been attacked, there was ""no evidence"" Mr Hughes had been her rapist. ""I am prepared to accept that you all believed that allegation was true,"" he said. ""But that belief does not begin to justify the attack on him."" ""The killing was brutal and, in part, sadistic,"" the judge added. ""Over 90 separate stab or slash wounds were found on his body. They were inflicted with at least two weapons - a sharp knife and a machete, or something akin to it ""The attack resulted in him receiving deep wounds and him bleeding for death. It would have been, for Mr Hughes, both humiliating and painful. ""The impact of the loss of Mr Hughes' life and the brutality of your attack has been made clear to me.  ""Christopher's death is still keenly felt and obviously will be indefinitely into the future. ""He has left behind a young daughter who will grow up without knowing her father. Your acts were designed to circumvent justice and ensure your suspicions prevailed over fact. ""This is murder the seriousness of which is particularly high. It was a murder designed to obstruct or interfere with the course of justice."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/dads-mutilated-body-left-road-29173085
'Shame on those standing by as a child is attacked in the street',"Eva Simpson is shocked by the level of violence against a girl in an attack outside a school and the fact it took so long for anyone to interveneI was taking my son to school when I heard a ping on my phone. I had been sent a video by a friend showing a black schoolgirl being viciously beaten up by a violent gang of girls who took it in turns to punch, kick and tear out her hair. The attack happened outside Thomas Knyvett College, a secondary school in Ashford, Surrey, in the middle of the day. I watched it wondering if the savage attack was ever going to end. As a parent, it was bad enough to see that level of violence against a defenceless girl. But what really got me was the ­attitude of the adults and bystanders. On the video you can clearly hear an adult voice actively encouraging the gang to continue the horrific attack and to, among other things, kick her in the face. Not one of the drivers, stuck in traffic as the fight spilled out into the street in front of them, got out of their cars to help. How could they just sit there and watch it all unfold and not lift a finger to help? Meanwhile, there are calls, including from actress Michaela Coel, for the headteacher Richard Beeson to be sacked after staff were filmed casually sauntering up to the group with no sense of urgency to finally intervene. I know there are protocols to rightly keep teachers and staff safe, but when does common sense and humanity prevail? Five arrests have now been made. But, is this who we are now? A country where we see a child being attacked and do nothing about it? How can we normalise such violence? And would people have sat by and just watched if the races had been reversed? I hate to think that if the same had happened to my children they’d be on their own. All kids should feel safe and be protected in and out of school. I hope and pray the brave victim is getting all the support she needs to deal with what happened and that she gets the justice she deserves.

Ambulance worker sacked and homeless for 'defending himself against aggressive patient',"Joe Hemming was sacked from his job at East Midlands Ambulance Service after restraining a patient he says was intoxicated and about to punch him inside his ambulanceAn ambulance technician was sacked after restraining an allegedly aggressive patient he claims tried to punch him. Joe Hemming held the drunken man's arm behind his back while still inside the emergency vehicle after arriving at A&E. The dad-of-three was suspended and then had his employment terminated which led to him being kicked out of his home just before Christmas. The 36-year-old went on to win a tribunal decision against his sacking - however, this is now being appealed by East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS). The service claims it was not informed proceedings had opened, resulting in it missing the deadline to respond. Joe told the Mirror the self-defence protocols taught to ambulance staff are ""not fit for purpose"" and he was forced to go against his training to protect himself and the patient. He said he and his colleagues are taught anti-aggravation protocol which says they can only to push an aggressor or pull away their arms. Have you been affected by this story? Let us know at webnews@mirror.co.uk   ""It’s not fit for frontline staff in relation to what we deal with,"" he explained.  ""That training given is more for like dementia patients, elderly patients who try to bite, who try to pinch you.  ""The training that we should have is control and restraint which is trained to police and prison staff because we are dealing with violent patients who don’t care if they hurt you, they will continue to bite, kick, stab you, punch you, they don’t care.""  Joe said he has previous training in the latter and instinctively used it.  He said the patient had suffered a head injury and he was worried if he pushed him back he could fall and hit his head, which could have proved fatal. Joe, who worked as an Emergency Medical Technician stationed at Grantham, Lincolnshire, was responding to the patient with a colleague on June 12, 2021. He was driving back to hospital, with the patient in the back of the ambulance when the panic button was pushed because the man had ""started to kick off"". Joe said he'd dealt with the same patient before and he'd previously been violent.  He was forced to pull over and went into the back of the ambulance. ""I went in with a short sharp burst of 'shut the f*** up, sit down' and it de-esculated the situation completely. ""I wouldn’t normally do it, in that situation I was on a live carriageway, I had to activate blue lights to pull over safely to assist my colleague because of the fear she was going to be assaulted."" Joe asked if his colleague would prefer to swap positions and she drive to A&E, but she said no.  ""Once we got back to hospital and he heard the words ‘you are going to sit in the waiting room’ he instantly started to kick off again,"" he said.  ""In an ambulance you have a side door and a back door... My back was to the side door, it was closed, I had nowhere to go, he had two ways to go either get up and turn left and go down the ramp or get up and turn right towards me. ""When he got up he turned right towards me and was making comments about 'I can show you how I can start', went to punch me with his left arm and obviously that’s when I had to restrain to stop any assault taking place."" Joe said he held the man's arm behind his back for around 30 seconds and led him inside the hospital.  He then filled out a report of the incident, but says when senior management at East Midlands Ambulance Service reviewed the CCTV they felt he had ""used excessive force, and not the training supplied"", he says. ""This is my main argument, how can they say when I had to make a split second decision, fight or flight, nowhere to escape, I didn’t want to be assaulted.  ""He had a head injury, if I’d pushed him as per my training he would have sustained further head injury, which potentially could have killed him. I couldn’t do it.  ""I went for the least restrictive option of putting his arm behind his back. I had control of his body, so I knew he couldn’t hurt himself or me.""   Joe said neither the patient or his colleague put in a complaint but on July 8 that year he was formally suspended from his job. He was then later told he was being let go completely. ""I had to leave my family home because when I left I had to claim Universal Credit, which informed my landlord,"" he explained.  He said his landlord said her mortgage company didn't allow for renters to be on benefits and he was left to find a new home within 28 days, with his children at the end of 2021.   In a decision document from the Employment Tribunals from March last year, seen by the Mirror, Joe was shown to have won his claim after the ambulance service didn’t respond in time. It said: ""The respondent has failed to present a valid response on time.  ""The Employment Judge has decided that a determination can properly be made of the claim, or part of it, in accordance with rule 21 of the Rules of Procedure."" Joe said he was subsequently awarded £80,000 at a remedy hearing in June last year. However, the decision is subject to an appeal from EMAS and he has not received any money. Joe now works with a private ambulance company. Tina Richardson, EMAS Deputy Director of Human Resources and Organisational Development told the Mirror: “EMAS did not receive the formal notification of the employment tribunal proceedings when the claim was started in January 2022.  ""This resulted in EMAS not having an opportunity to provide a response or have representation at the hearing to support the formal processes and investigations at that time. “Due to these mitigating circumstances, EMAS was given the opportunity to set out its full defence and the case will be heard later this year. Therefore, it is not appropriate to comment any further at this stage.” The ambulance service say they encourage all staff to report any aggression and violence against them, and will work with the police where necessary to prosecute offenders. Body worn cameras are now common practice in the service, which it hopes will deter and de-escalate aggressive situations. CCTV runs continuously inside the ambulance saloons once activated.

Google loses £100BILLION as AI chatbot Bard answers question wrong,"The new Bard feature was shown to make an embarrassing error' after Google boss Sundar Pichai said it would answer questions more intelligently, causing share prices to tumbleA blunder by chatbot Bard has cost Google a staggering £100billion after it got an answer wrong.  The AI machine answered a question about the James Webb space telescope wrong in a promo video after CEO Sundar Pichai brought it in to answer questions more intelligently. The company posted a GIF on Twitter demonstrating Bard, but followers were quick to spot the error. In the clip which has been viewed more than one million times, the bot can be seen responding when given the prompt: ""What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can I tell my nine-year old about?"" But the state-of-the-art technology was shown to fluff it when replying with several answers, including that the telescope took the very first photograph of another planet outside the solar system.   The first picture, in fact, was taken by the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) in 2004, according to NASA. The blunder prompted Google's market value to tumble by £100,000,000,000 after share prices in parent company Alphabet Inc fell by 9%. At its lowest price on Wednesday, shares stood at £81.16, a fall of 8.1% on Tuesday’s price £88.35. The mistake was spotted just before a presentation at Google headquarters at Mountain View in California.  Gil Luria, senior software analyst at D.A. Davidson, said that ""while Google has been a leader in AI innovation over the last several years, they seemed to have fallen asleep on implementing this technology into their search product"". He added: ""Google has been scrambling over the last few weeks to catch up on Search and that caused the announcement Tuesday to be rushed and the embarrassing mess up of posting a wrong answer during their demo."" Investors were also reportedly left underwhelmed by a presentation on the feature, which tech experts said did not appear as refined or polished as competitor Microsoft's already popular chatbot, ChatGPT, which it plans to incorporate into the Bing search engine.

Ex-MP Jared O'Mara jailed for FOUR YEARS over fraud to feed cocaine habit,"O’Mara, 41 was convicted yesterday of six counts of fraud, after he and members of his staff attempted to submit fake expense claims worth £24,000 in the name of a fictitious disability support charityFormer MP Jared O’Mara has been sentenced to four years in prison for expenses fraud to feed his cocaine habit. O’Mara, 41 was convicted yesterday of six counts of fraud, after he and members of his staff attempted to submit fake expense claims worth £24,000 in the name of a fictitious disability support charity. Sentencing disgraced former politician, Judge Tom Bayliss KC told him: “You abused your position as a Member of Parliament to commit fraud. You have not shown a single degree of remorse.” Jurors at Leeds Crown Court were told O’Mara, branded “dishonest” and “rotten” by the prosecution, used the cash to fund an “extravagant” lifestyle and a “galloping” cocaine habit. The ex-Labour MP made headlines after ousting Lib Dem Nick Clegg, the former Deputy Prime Minister, from his seat in Sheffield Hallam. But he was almost immediately rocked by scandal, after a string of misogynistic and homophobic message board posts emerged, alongside allegations of about his behaviour while working as a bar manager and DJ at the city’s West Street Live venue.  After being suspended - then reinstated - by Labour, he left the party in 2018, claiming he had not been made to “feel welcome.”  The Mirror revealed O’Mara’s arrest on suspicion of fraud in August 2019, after police had been alerted to the fake invoices by Gareth Arnold, his chief of staff. Arnold was sentenced to 15 months, suspended for two years.   Arnold was jointly charged with six of the eight offences O’Mara faced in court. O’Mara was convicted of six offences, while Arnold was convicted of three. John Woodliff, a former bouncer at West Street Live, was cleared of one charge of fraud. During the trial, jurors were told of Mr O’Mara’s “prodigious” cocaine habit, consuming up to 5g of the class A drug a day, along with booze and 60 cigarettes. O’Mara’s family would deliver bottles of vodka and Mountain Dew and packets of cigarettes to his Sheffield flat on an almost daily basis, Arnold claimed under questioning in court. Leeds Crown Court heard he made four claims for a total of £19,400 from a ""fictitious"" organisation called Confident About Autism South Yorkshire (CAASY), which jurors were told referred to his friend John Woodliff. O'Mara was also found to have submitted a false contract of employment for Woodliff, pretending he worked as a constituency support officer. Mr Woodliff, who effectively became a “personal assistant” to O’Mara, said he would go to his flat and “pretty much get him up because he just lay in bed all day”.  The prosecution said his work involved tidying up the pizza boxes strewn around O’Mara’s flat and helping him get dressed. Mr Woodliff was cleared by the jury of having any role in the fraud. O'Mara was found not guilty of two fraud charges over invoices from Arnold, for media and PR work that prosecutors claimed was never carried out. But even after being arrested, he continued his attempts at fraud. In February 2020 he emailed IPSA, falsely claiming the police investigation into him had been completed and he was entitled to be paid the two invoices relating to Arnold, which totalled £4,650. O’Mara, who has autism and cerebral palsy, successfully petitioned to give evidence at the trial by video link - but eventually declined to speak on his own behalf.  After appearing the 12-day trial - and previous court hearings - remotely, he was ordered to attend today’s sentencing in person, with Judge Bayliss telling the disgraced politician that “indulgence” was over. In the months leading up to O’Mara’s arrest, the court heard, he was in “dire need” of cash to fund his lifestyle. The court heard that O'Mara had a ""dysfunctional"" office which was ""haemorrhaging staff"" at the time he made the claims. Former case worker Kevin Gregory-Coyne said O'Mara went to his constituency office ""once or twice"" in six months and attended one staff meeting while apparently ""on some sort of substance"". Arnold told the court he and O’Mara referred to cocaine by the codeword “goose”.  In one text exchange, revealed in court, Arnold told O’Mara: “I’ll walk down. Invite the goose as well. I’ll bring the OJ and make sure you’ve got ample fags” Another message from O’Mara to a contact days before his arrest in August 2019, read: “Order 2 bags of goose. I have the hundred quid. I have 150 in fact” He submitted falsified invoices to Parliament’s expenses watchdog, IPSA - using the postcode of a local McDonalds as the address of the bogus charity. The invoices all looked different, and all were rejected by IPSA. Jurors heard that one message from Arnold to a friend in April 2019 described O'Mara as being ""a few k in debt with a dealer"".  And Arnold went to South Yorkshire Police in July 2019 after ""reaching a point at which he was no longer willing to participate in the fraud"".  In his call to police, played to jurors, Arnold said: ""It's a bit of a tricky one but yesterday I spoke to the 999 service and the mental health crisis team about my employer, who I believe is suffering a severe psychotic episode and has delusions of a conspiracy against him. ""I also believe he has been submitting fake expense claims to the Government very recently."" Arnold said he had ""lost his patience"" with O'Mara after he apparently drank a litre of vodka before a TV appearance and sent a young female staff member messages ""calling her things like 'my little angel' and 'you're beautiful""'. ""Jared I tried but you got s***faced for Look North interview and harassed a female member of staff,” Arnold wrote in a text message. “You need to be accountable for your actions, it's you who doesn't come into the office and takes cocaine instead of going to Parliament....you don't give one iota about your constituents...it's not about us VS you it's about you doing your f****** job.""  Events came to a head after Arnold dramatically resigned, hijacking O’Mara’s own Twitter account to brand him “the most disgustingly morally bankrupt person I have ever had the displeasure of working with.""  Opening the case to jurors just over two weeks ago, prosecutor James Bourne-Arton said: ""O'Mara viewed Ipsa, and the taxpayers' money that they administered, as a source of income that was his to claim and use as he wished, not least in the enjoyment of his extensive cocaine habit.""

"Thousands more families could get up to £10,000 payment under huge benefits shake-up","Cohabiting parents with dependent children can now apply for Bereavement Support Payment - previously, this help was only available to parents who were married or in a civil partnershipThousands more families could be entitled to money worth up to £10,000 thanks to a change in bereavement benefits. Cohabiting parents with dependent children will be entitled to apply for Bereavement Support Payment from today (February 9). Previously, this help was only available to parents who were married or in a civil partnership.  The change will benefit a further 1,800 families each year, while more than 21,000 households previously denied support can now apply for backdated payments.  To qualify, claimants must have been eligible for Bereavement Support Payment or Widowed Parent’s Allowance on or after August 30, 2018. The Bereavement Support Payment is worth £2,500, plus £100 a month for 18 months for those eligible.  If you receive child benefits, you will receive higher rates. This includes a first payment of £3,500, plus £350 a month for 18 months. It means the maximum help you could receive is £9,800. In order to receive the full amount, you must claim within the first three months of your partner's death. You can claim up to 21 months afterwards, but you will get fewer monthly payments. DWP Minister Viscount Younger of Leckie said: “Losing a partner is tragic and this change will mean more bereaved parents can access this support through a profoundly difficult time for them and their children. “It has been our priority to get this legislation right, so it is fairer to bereaved children with parents who were not married or in a civil partnership, and I am very pleased this is now confirmed in law."" Minister for Social Mobility, Youth and Progression Mims Davies MP said: “We have made this important change to help thousands more grieving parents access the financial support they need and deserve. “We know so many lone parents are doing their best to support their families through such a difficult time and our bereavement benefits offer a lifeline to help them adjust to the impact of this. “I would urge anyone who thinks they may be eligible to make an application, as crucially, some bereaved parents will also be able to receive backdated payments to ensure they don’t miss out.”   Bereavement Support Payment - what you need to know  To be eligible for Bereavement Support Payment, you must be under state pension age and living in the UK or a country that pays bereavement benefits. Your partner must have either paid National Insurance contributions for at least 25 weeks in one tax year since April 6, 1975, or died because of an accident at work or a disease caused by work.  You can make a claim for Bereavement Support Payment online through Gov.uk, by calling the Bereavement Service helpline on 0800 151 2012, or by downloading a form online.  If you aren’t eligible for Bereavement Support Payment, you might be entitled to Widowed Parent’s Allowance instead. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/thousands-more-families-could-up-29173298
Two photos of Nicola Bulley's dog swimming in river could blow key police theory apart,"Missing mum Nicola Bulley vanished while out on a dog walk with springer spaniel Willow in St Michaels on Wyre, Lancashire, on January 27 with police hypothesising she fell in the riverPhotos of missing mum Nicola Bulley's dog Willow swimming could undermine a key police theory. The 45-year-old mum disappeared while out walking her springer spaniel along the River Wyre in the village of St Michaels, Lancashire, on January 27. Her phone was found on a bench overlooking the water, with the dog wandering alone nearby. A major police search was quickly launched before it was confirmed the force's main hypothesis was Nicola accidentally fell into the water. Superintendent Sally Riley said there was a chance the missing mortgage adviser had gone to the water's edge due to something relating to Willow. Have you been affected by this story? Let us know at webnews@mirror.co.uk     She suggested perhaps the dog had dropped its tennis ball into the river - with the spaniel having been completely dry when she was found. However, Nicola had shared a number of photos showing Willow happily swimming in open water on the same route. The images posted on social media by Nicola last year seem to imply the dog was comfortable around water and its owner likely wouldn't have been overly concerned. In one image, Willow is seen with the ball in her mouth, swimming happily towards Nicola.  That was snapped on July 5, 2022, and was captioned: “A quick morning walk before a busy day ahead! “Willow living her best life!” This set of photos was tagged as being taken in St Michaels on Wyre, where she would go missing seven months later. Another image taken in April 2022, shows a very wet Willow standing on the sandbank next to the river having clearly just been chasing the ball into the water. Another image from that set shows Willow moments before she went into the water.  ""And therefore whilst I don’t want to speculate as to what may have happened, it is our working hypothesis that she has entered the water accidentally and that’s why there is no physical evidence on the field,"" said Supt Riley. She went on to say: ""The dog was off the lead, this was normal for the dog to run about and Nicola was on a teams call, which again it would be normal for her not to participate in actively and just have the phone to listen in, effectively. ""Anything could have happened with the dog whereby Nicola may have gone - and I don’t wish to speculate, we don’t know - but it is possible the dog was loose and off the lead that there may have been an issue with the dog that led her to go near to the water’s edge. ""She puts the phone down momentarily and Nicola may have fallen in. That is a possibility,"" said Supt Riley.  She confirmed the dog was dry when found by other walkers. ""We don’t believe the dog was in the river because the dog, we believe, was dry and the witnesses have not described the dog swimming or jumping into the river. ""We don’t know why Nicola may have entered the water if she did,"" she added. Lancashire Police did not wish to comment on the matter when approached by the Mirror.

Epsom College head looking forward to 'exciting future' in interview week before death,"The interview was released last Monday - just six days before Epsom College headteacher Emma Pattison was tragically found dead alongside her seven-year-old daughter, Lettie, and husband GeorgeThe headteacher of Epsom College said she was looking forward to an ""exciting future"" in a poignant interview published just a week before her death. Emma Pattison, 45, told an education magazine of her passion for developing her pupils and ambitions for the prestigious school, of which she became its first female head in September last year. She said: ""We want pupils to find things that are going to matter to them for the rest of their lives, and nothing could matter more to them than the person they are going to become."" Emma also discussed a shifting political and economic landscape in the private school sector, saying: ""It could be time to shape a really exciting future for the country."" The interview with School Management Plus was released last Monday - just six days before Emma was tragically found dead alongside her seven-year-old daughter, Lettie, and husband George, 39. The deaths are being investigated as a possible murder-suicide, where Mr Pattison killed his wife and daughter before turning the gun on himself.   Tributes have since poured in for Emma from teachers, colleagues and school leaders, who described her as a ""dear friend"" and a ""shining light"". Emma's devotion to pupils was self-evident, with her telling of creating learning experiences that help students ""define their values, their own moral code and their own sense of integrity"". She said her vision was to reach wider sections of the community, and be ""part of the solution to some of the problems in society"". Emma added: ""We’re all considering our charitable status in independent schools and wanting to make sure we uphold the values inherent in that, particularly in a college like ours which was founded on those principles."" The headteacher also told of her delight in making a positive impact on children's lives, as highlighted through a story of one boy who ""made a couple of errors of judgement this term"".  She continued: ""Because he has a lovely warm personality, he’s been able to engage with another lad who’s struggling in the local school and really make a difference to that lad’s experience.  ""Our college pupil was able to use his own life experiences to really transform life for someone else. We think that’s a very powerful thing."" Emma further told how her pupils gave over 8,500 hours of their time to charitable community projects in one academic year alone. The school's ethos for community and hard work was reflected by her own background, as she recalled growing up on a farm in Lincolnshire and feeding chickens at 6.30am ""as part of everyday life in a close-knit, hard-working farming community"".  She went on to attend her local girls' grammar school, later becoming head of modern foreign languages at Guildford High School, deputy head (academic) at St John's Leatherhead and head at Croydon High School.  The article originally appeared in the magazine's print edition, which is believed to have been distributed last week and received by some schools on the day after Emma's death. Teacher and education commentator Zoe MacDougall, who interviewed Emma, said in the magazine that her ""warm and easy personality"" made her feel like they were ""talking about a favourite topic with an old friend"". She added: ""I felt like her job was a real joy to her. Talking to Emma, it was clear that service and kindness were core values. ""Her vision was for her pupils to learn truths about the world around them, in preparation for the adults that she hoped they would become: people who would play leading roles in society with understanding, compassion and integrity. ""I found her inspirational.""  Following the tragedy, Epsom College reportedly decided to close until half-term break as police conduct a homicide investigation. Detective Chief Inspector Kimball Edey, senior investigating officer on the case, said: ""This is an incredibly traumatic incident and we are working around the clock to investigate and understand the exact circumstances which led to this point.  ""We understand the public concern and upset, and we will clarify what we can, when we can, while respecting the right to a level of privacy for the families of those who have lost their lives."" Acting headmaster Paul Williams announced the school's closure on Tuesday following the ""incredibly distressing"" details about how Mrs Pattison died, reported the BBC.  In a letter to parents, Mr Williams said: ""Now is a time for families to come together and try and process this shocking news.  ""The impact on your children cannot be underestimated and we are doing everything we possibly can to support them in whatever way they need."" Boarding students at the college pay more than £42,000 a year and its alumni include Conservative MP Sir Michael Fallon, broadcaster Jeremy Vine and comedian Tim Vine.

"UK snow maps show new Beast from the East on way with 1,000km blizzard to hit","Brits have been told to prepare for a second Beast from the East storm this month after yellow warnings from Met Office and snow maps showed a 1,000km blizzard heading over to the UK A snowstorm has been forecast to sweep across the UK as Brits brace for a blizzard similar to the Beast from the East. The Met Office has warned the chances of a major Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW) are likely to happen very soon, with snow to fall for three days in row. The 2018 'Beast from the East' in February saw 22 inches of snowfall in some areas and an estimated £1.2 billion in damage caused. In a blog post, the Met Office wrote: ""The latest forecasts are showing that a major SSW is now likely to take place. ""A major SSW often makes the jet stream meander more, which can lead to a large area of blocking high pressure over northern Europe, including the UK [and Ireland]. ""This blocking high pressure can lead to cold, dry weather in the north of Europe, including the UK [and Ireland].""   Snow maps show a 1,000km blizzard heading over to large parts of the UK in only a matter of days. According to WX Charts, the UK will see a huge storm, making its way from the East, and bringing heavy rain to Northern Ireland, southern parts of Scotland, and most of England from Monday, February 20. Wales and Northern Ireland will experience heavy snowfall falling at a rate of at least 3cm per hour. Though the Midlands are predicted to experience snow falling at the rate of 5cm per hour, and England 2cm per hour. The Met Office had issued a snow and ice weather warning (Wednesday, February 8) predicting an icy blizzard over parts of the country.  People were told to be careful of icy roads and expect delays in public transport due to cancellations.  Mayor of London Sadiq Khan had also enabled the Severe Weather Emergency Protocol (SWEP), a measure that provides urgent assistance to rough sleepers during adverse conditions (Tuesday, February 7).  It came after temperatures dropped as low as -4C in some parts of the country this week. The Met Office Forecast Today: Band of cloud and occasional rain or drizzle clearing from southern England later in the morning, then most central and southern areas dry with sunny spells. Showers in northwest and north, frequent and wintry in far north where very windy. Tonight: Fine and dry in the south with a widespread sharp frost. Some showers in the far north, then clouding over with occasional rain in the northwest and north.  Friday: Dry and bright in central and eastern areas. Cloudier in the far north and west with drizzle in places and more persistent and at times heavy rain for northwest Scotland. Outlook for Saturday and Sunday: Dry for most with sunny intervals once any overnight fog clears. Milder than of late, although some overnight frost is still possible. Strong winds in the north easing. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uk-snow-brits-brace-new-29173218
Subway diner taken to hospital as she swells up seven minutes after biting into sandwich,"Kiera Gleed alleges that seven minutes after eating her sub from the fast food chain she started to notice a tingling in her throat. She called an ambulance as her throat tightenedA woman claims she was rushed to hospital minutes after biting into a Subway sandwich after having an allergic reaction, despite telling staff before ordering. Kiera Gleed alleges that seven minutes after eating her sub from the fast food chain she started to notice a tingling in her throat. Within minutes, her whole body began to swell up and she developed a bright red rash. The 24-year-old, who is allergic to dairy, wheat and nuts, claims the reaction was 'one of the worst' she has ever suffered. Subway confirmed it was investigating the incident. Kiera, from Midlothian, was dining in Edinburg and she claims she checked the company's allergen guide.  She also left a note on the delivery app Just Eat, and tried phoning the store multiple times to ensure her order was kept away from all the ingredients she might react to. Kiera had an anaphylactic reaction and was rushed to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.  She is now looking for answers as to why this happened and is also hoping to spread the word to make others aware of the importance of food safety.   Kiera, from Bonnyrigg, said: ""I'm severely allergic to all forms of dairy and lactose, as well as wheat, shellfish, nuts and oats among others.  ""I'm used to properly examining the packaging of the food me and my family buy and rarely actually have food delivered. ""I ordered a Subway from store near me just as a quick bite to eat before work but it turned into so much more. ""I always write in the notes what I'm allergic to as I know they will see it.  ""As well as leaving the note, I looked at the allergen guide online to check what I had ordered did not contain anything that I am intolerant to, and I also tried calling the shop six times but nobody answered. ""I took a few bites and noticed my throat started to tingle then it started to swell.  ""I couldn't actually swallow properly and my airways became blocked. In-between my teeth started swelling and my lips as well.  ""Most of the reactions I've had just made me sick, so this was one of the worst for sure."" Within minutes Kiera knew she was in trouble and started to panic.  After phoning an ambulance, she was taken to the Royal Infirmary.  Images Kiera took hours later show her whole body covered in a red and bumpy rash.  She told Edinburgh Live: ""My mum told me to phone an ambulance and take my EpiPen but using it yourself is scary. The paramedics gave me a stronger version and that came into effect. Thankfully they arrived really quickly after I phoned them. ""I was on my own for a few hours until my friends came but during that time my skin kept swelling and I was covered in blotches from head to toe.  ""I went into work the next day but I only lasted three hours because I was so tired and still didn't feel the best."" Kiera's mum Julia said that most of her daughter's food is home cooked and both she and her daughter are incredibly wary of what they buy while at the shops. Julia said: ""When Kiera has a reaction like this, she ends up absolutely drained. She has had allergies since birth and most of her food is home cooked. Only very rarely does she order a takeaway from anywhere and that is only after we've checked the allergen information. ""As her mum and having lived with her all her life, there isn't anything else she could have done to make sure she was safe and I'm just pleased that she phoned the ambulance when she did. ""She was really distressed when she phoned me. It was a parent's worst nightmare knowing it was out of my hands.  ""I was relying on her being conscious enough to phone 999 and then the poor NHS need to have an ambulance available. Luckily they gave her a stronger adrenalin when they got her that stabilised her.""  A Subway spokeswoman said: ""The safety and security of our guests is of paramount importance to Subway.  ""We have very strict procedures in place to ensure that Subway restaurants serve products safely and to our customers’ satisfaction. ""All Subway restaurants are independently owned and operated by franchisees.  ""The franchisee is already in direct contact with the customer and Just Eat, to fully investigate this matter, and ensure that we have all the facts and that the correct procedures have been followed."" A Just Eat spokeswoman added: ""At Just Eat, we take allergens seriously.  ""We want our customers to have a positive experience when ordering food from partners on our platform and are sorry to hear that in this case, the customer's experience did not reflect the standards expected.  ""We are currently investigating this with the restaurant partner involved and are also in touch with the customer.""

"Girlfriend knife murder accused told 999 'There's blood everywhere, she's dying'","Kevin Mannion, 45, s accused of murdering 22-year-old Elinor O'Brien in a flat in Manchester, on Tuesday, August 16 last year. The court heard the harrowing 999 callA man accused of murdering his 22-year-old girlfriend told 999 operators she was dying before calling a solicitor minutes after emergency services arrived, a jury has heard. Kevin Mannion, 45, is accused of murdering Elinor O'Brien in a flat in Manchester, on Tuesday, August 16 last year.  Prosecutors allege that Mannion stabbed Elinor in a 'rageful and violent attack' following an argument. Emergency services found Elinor with a deep stab wound, and she was rushed to hospital where she died three days later following a 'catastrophic' brain injury.  Mannion, who is also charged with wounding with intent and coercive or controlling behaviour, denies all the charges. At Liverpool Crown Court on Wednesday, jurors heard a recording of a 999 call made from his phone at 12.16pm on August 16.  During the call, Mannion can be heard repeating Elinor’s name before saying ‘please come’. “There’s blood everywhere. She’s been punctured in the groin. Please come,” he continues, before the operator asks for his address. “You need to help. She’s dying, she’s dying. Please, please, please come,” Mannion responds before giving his address. “I’m begging you to hurry up,” he adds.  “She’s been cut with a sharp object. She was picking her stuff up, I was throwing her stuff telling her to get out and something punctured her in the groin. I’m begging you to get someone here.” Giving evidence, Pc Luke Needham told the court he was called to the scene at around 12:30pm.  When he arrived, he said ambulance and paramedic crews were already on scene, and they were all escorted upstairs to Mannion’s flat by the concierge, the court heard. He told the court he saw a man laying over the bottom half of a person, and noticed a lot of blood on the floor.  He said as he got closer, it was ‘clear’ the male was attempting to stem blood flowing from a wound, and he turned and said ‘thank god you are here’. “My first impression was that something wasn’t right,” he told the court.  He said Mannion was ‘sweating a lot’ and ‘breathing heavily’ - signs he associated with Acute Behavioural Disorder but ‘also’ showing ‘something had gone on’. Cross-examining Pc Needham, junior defence counsel Mr Jed O’Connor said: “There was a lady bleeding in the hallway of the flat, so it’s pretty obvious something wasn’t right”.  He then asked the officer if he accepted that Mannion appeared ‘distressed’. PC Needham replied: “I would disagree slightly because he made a call to that person, the legal representative. If I was in that position I would not have done that.    ""So that is why, in my opinion, something wasn’t right.” He then told the court Mannion appeared to call a man named Greg, who he believed to be a lawyer, approximately six minutes after emergency services arrived at the flat.  Junior prosecutor Mr Jamie Baxter asked him why he believed the recipient of the call was a lawyer. ""On the call he said, 'something is going on, I know the police are going to want to speak to me. I just need you there,"" PC Needham replied.  He also told the court that he noticed the number on Mannion's phone was saved as 'Greg - solicitor'. Mannion's neighbour, Ivan Watson, also gave evidence on Wednesday.  He told jurors he recalled hearing 'arguing' from the accused's flat from around midday on August 16.  He told the court he recognised two voices - one female and one male - from other arguments he had heard through the walls of his flat. Prosecuting, Mr Richard Pratt KC asked Mr Watson what he could hear. He replied: “It sounded like the usual argument, maybe a bit higher pitched, maybe more screaming at one point.” Mr Pratt then asked if Mr Watson had heard anything after the ‘screaming’.  Mr Watson told the court he thought he could hear the male voice outside the apartment. “It sounded like he was saying the female’s name and was banging on the door. It sounded like he had been locked out,” he said. He then confirmed that the name he heard the male saying was ‘Elinor’. Mr Watson told the court the argument got ‘louder’, but he ‘couldn’t make out’ what was said.  He said at this point he considered calling the emergency services, but then the voices went ‘quiet’ and ‘soon after that’ he heard sirens as police and ambulance crews arrived. Defending, Mr Francis FitzGibbons KC asked Mr Watson if he had ever met Mannion or Elinor. He confirmed he had not ever met or seen either of them.

Video 'proof' that missing Nicola Bulley is not in river revealed by diving expert,"Dive expert Peter Faulding says the clip of the River Wyre showing it to be slow-moving, meaning Nicola Bulley' body would have sunk “very quickly” and remained nearbyMissing mum Nicola Bulley is not in the river where she was last seen, according to a diving expert who has shared what he calls video proof from the water's edge.  Peter Faulding says the clip of the River Wyre shows it to be slow-moving, meaning her body would have sunk “very quickly” and remained nearby if she had gone in. The 60-year-old, who has worked on hundreds of similar cases, also said the rocks by the bank, which would have been under just 2ft of water when she went missing, mean she could have simply “stood up” if she’d fallen down. He said the clip makes him believe Nicola didn't fall into the river, in St Michael's in Wyre, Lancashire when she vanished on Friday, January 27 while walking her dog. He added that he felt a “wider land search” of outbuildings and sheds was now needed after his team’s sonar scans of the river failed to find any proof of her body in the river. Mr Faulding, drafted in to help Lancashire Police's efforts, called off his search on Wednesday after his team found no trace of her using its advanced sonar equipment. Police probing her disappearance say they believe she fell in, but Mr Faulding maintains the short clip of a log barely moving on the water blows their theory apart.   He said of the video: “The log stayed at that point for 20 minutes, and it actually spiralled and went up six feet and came back to the same place. “The river on the day was slightly higher - it was about a foot higher - but I’d be very surprised in my experience [if she was there] as a body usually goes to the bottom very quickly. “If Nicola slipped down the bank, she would have landed in about 2ft of water but onto rocks, and she could have stood up."" Mr Faulding's team, Specialist Group International, began searching the River Wyre, which flows from the Forest of Bowland to Fleetwood, Lancashire and into the Irish sea, on Monday.  He said they had finished their investigation yesterday afternoon after an extensive search of a one-mile stretch of the river, which is 13ft deep close to where Nicola was last seen, showed she was not there. Mr Faulding said it's his professional opinion that Nicola’s body would have been seen if it had floated any further downstream on the day she disappeared. The diver yesterday took Nicola’s shattered partner Paul Ansell to the bench where their dog, and her mobile phone, were found on the day she vanished. Mr Faulding said of his conversation with Paul: “He’s very upset and he was in tears yesterday. He’s very emotional, obviously.  “He was shocked at how shallow the rocks were yesterday. He thought it was really deep there. If she had gone in she would have landed on the rocks. “The family thanked us for being here. They said ‘You’ve given us confidence now’ and his belief is that Nicola has not gone in that river."" ""We’ve gone about a mile upstream, which is way up the search area, and ruled there is nothing in that section of the river. “If you start putting the pieces of the jigsaw together, it’s very strange, and it would need an extremely strong current on the day to take her so quickly over the weir before the police arrived.  “And if she was floating, she would have been seen by the public, or landed elsewhere – and there’s just no sign of this poor lady."" He said: “My personal view is probably although the search is done of the river, I feel that a wider area land search needs to be done around the specific area. “Maybe more talking to the public and looking in sheds and outbuildings and stuff. “But there’s been people coming up and trying to break into outbuildings looking for Nicola – stay away! It’s causing a lot of problems. He added: “Nobody knows if Nicola is alive or dead, there’s no confirmation. All we’ve got is a mobile phone and a dog harness. “We have worked so hard up here, and the family are baffled."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/video-proof-missing-nicola-bulley-29173662
Ambulance workers willing to strike until summer if Tories drag out NHS pay dispute,"Unison says ambulance workers - who will strike again this week - were prepared to continue industrial action for several months as Health Secretary Steve Barclay refuses to discuss pay settlementsAmbulance workers are willing to strike into the summer if ministers continue to drag out the NHS industrial dispute, unions have warned. Some 15,000 emergency service workers walk out this Friday ahead of new union ballots that could see more staff gain a mandate to strike for another six months. Unison, whose paramedics are on strike tomorrow, say ministers are “happy to let the public suffer” as they “wait for public opinion to turn”. Helen Gorton, Unison’s head of health, said: “Why is Rishi Sunak still pretending to the public and not being honest that the plan is just to sit tight and wait for public opinion to turn? “The Government strategy seems to be just to sit this out until the end of the NHS Pay Review Body process. “So that means that in terms of the impact they are condemning the public to potentially another three or four months of this. “Until there is an improved pay offer that we can put to members then we don’t end this dispute. “This week we've only had one day where there's been no [NHS] union on strike. “I think that could become all too common if there isn't a step up of Government intent to resolve the dispute.”   There have been repeated meetings with unions and Health Secretary Steve Barclay at which he has refused to discuss the 2022/23 pay settlement dispute. The Government is pushing unions to forget about this year’s pay and focus on the deal for 2023/24 financial year - for which the contested NHS Pay Review Body is yet to deliver a recommendation. Unions have lost faith in the independence of the body and the process is notoriously slow, with Government providing its evidence for a restrained pay deal many months late. Hospital bosses have already insisted ministers must settle the 2022/23 dispute before moving on to the next round of pay negotiations. Ms Gorton said: “It feels like the Government on the one hand is talking up the danger of the strikes and on the other hand, doing absolutely nothing to step in and protect the public from them. “They're happy to let the public suffer.” Ambulance staff working for five services in England – London, Yorkshire, the North West, North East and South West - will strike on Friday.  Paramedics will leave picket lines to answer the most life-threatening 999 emergencies. Their current strike mandate runs until May.  The other five ambulance services in England and one covering Wales are currently being balloted to strike after narrowly missing the turnout threshold in an earlier ballot. If, as union leaders now expect, more than 50% vote and indicate they are willing to strike they will have a mandate to do so for a further six months. New ballots by both major ambulance worker unions Unison and GMB could extend those with a mandate to strike from around 20,000 to 33,000 staff. They represent paramedics, emergency care assistants, ambulance technicians, other 999 crew members, call handlers and control room staff. The Tories are sticking to their 4% pay award for England despite inflation running at over 10%.  The devolved government in Wales has issued a new pay offer of 7.5%.   New NHS data shows the number of 999 calls answered per day in January by ambulance services in England was the lowest since March 2021. Services answered 679,517 calls last month, or 21,920 per day, both down a third (33%) on December 2022, NHS England said. The average call answer time in January was the lowest since May 2021. The number of incidents per day fell month on month by 4%, to 21,106. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it was “regrettable” some union members were taking further industrial action, at a time when the NHS was already under pressure. “The Health and Social Care Secretary has had constructive meetings with unions and has been clear he wants to continue to discuss what is fair and affordable as part of the 2023/24 pay process.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/breaking-ambulance-workers-willing-strike-29134543

Norovirus warning as cases of winter vomiting bug spike to highest level in decade,"Doctors have issued a warning after scientists revealed a 66% rise in norovirus cases this season - whilst seeing the highest number of infections in the elderly in more than 10 yearsHealth bosses have issued a warning after a seasonal spike in norovirus cases.  Scientists say the number of cases reported in labs were up by more than 60% this winter, compared with the average over the past five seasons.  The majority of outbreaks in recent weeks were reported in care homes, with cases in over 65s at the highest level in over a decade. The infection is the most common cause of vomiting and diarrhoea.  National surveillance data shows laboratory reports of the virus are 66% higher than the average at this time of year.  While high numbers of cases in this age group is expected at this time of year, these levels haven’t been seen in over a decade.   In response to the increase in cases, UKHSA is reminding the public of the actions that they can take to reduce the spread of norovirus. Norovirus is highly infectious and is easily spread through contact with someone with the infection or with contaminated surfaces.  One of the best ways to prevent the spread of norovirus is by practicing good hand hygiene.  Most people will make a full recovery within two-three days but it is important to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration, especially for the very young, elderly or those with weakened immune systems who are more at risk.  The number of outbreaks caused by norovirus have increased in hospitals, schools and care homes, with the majority of outbreaks reported in care home settings.  Dr Lesley Larkin, Surveillance Lead, Gastrointestinal Infections and Food Safety (One Health) Division at the UK Health Security Agency, said: “Norovirus levels are currently the highest we have seen at this time of year in over a decade. Most reported cases are in the over 65s and we’re also seeing a rise in reported outbreaks, particularly in care home settings.  ""Please stay at home if you are experiencing norovirus symptoms and do not return to work (particularly if you work with vulnerable people or food) or send sick children to school or nursery until 48 hours after symptoms have cleared.  ""If you have a loved one in a care home or hospital, please avoid visiting until 48 hours after symptoms have cleared. “Regular hand washing is really important to help stop the spread of this bug, but remember, alcohol gels do not kill off norovirus so soap and warm water is best.” NHS Medical Director Professor Sir Stephen Powis said: “The number of people in hospitals with norovirus has risen significantly in line with what we are seeing in the community and in care homes – it is a really unpleasant illness to catch, but for the vast majority of people it will usually pass in a couple of days, and self-treating at home is the best way to help yourself and avoid putting others at risk.”  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/norovirus-warning-cases-winter-vomiting-29174687
Nicola Bulley search operation moves to the sea - cops seen at Morecambe Bay,"Nicola Bulley's search operation has now moved to the sea at Morecambe Bay with specialist police teams now having been pictured today in two boats combing the waterA search operation to find Nicola Bulley has now moved to Morecambe Bay with police seen combing the area. Nearly two weeks on from her disappearance, two boats with specialist police teams have been seen in the sea. They were then spotted moving upstream searching either side of the River Wyre. The 45-year-old went missing while walking her dog in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, on 27 January. Officers have reportedly confirmed they are now concentrating on the mouth of the river and believe that finding Ms Bulley ""in the open sea becomes more of a possibility"".   A Lancashire Police statement read: ""Our investigation to the disappearance of Nicola Bulley is continuing and we continue to search areas of the River Wyre and surrounding area. ""People may have seen less police activity today than previously in the area of the river above the weir but that is not because we have stepped down our searches, it is because the focus of the search has moved further downstream into the area of the river which becomes tidal and then out towards the sea."" It comes after a dive search specialist with years of experience claimed the missing mum-of-two was not in the river. Peter Faulding's independent Specialist Group International (SGI) firm were drafted in earlier this week to aid Lancashire Police divers with their high-tech sonar equipment.  But he has now told the Mirror they have completed scouring the area of river from where Nicola's phone was found - and where investigators theorise she likely fell in on January 27. ""We’ve done our job and we’ve cleared the areas that we were tasked with by Lancashire Police and we are happy that there is nothing in that water,"" he said. But during a press conference in St Andrew's on Wyre village hall, superintendent Sally Riley of the Lancashire Constabulary, said that while Ms Bulley has not been found, it does not necessarily mean she wasn't in the water.  ""Our search has not found Nicola in the river and then a re-search in parts by SGI has found the same,"" she said. But Superintendent Riley said that the police still believes that Ms Bulley could have fallen into the water. “In the light of other inquiries being discounted from the investigation so far… clearly our main belief is that Nicola did fall into the river,"" she said. “Clearly Mr Faulding isn’t included within all the investigation detail any more than the members of the public are that I’m briefing through these sorts of press conferences.”  Ms Bulley vanished on January 27 after dropping off her two children at school in St Michael's, Lancashire, before taking family dog Willow for a walk on a nearby trail. However, her phone was later found on a bench, with the springer spaniel wandering nearby without her harness. Superintendent Riley has also urged the public this week to avoid ""distressing"" speculation about what might have happened to Ms Bulley. ""We would ask that people in the wider community, particularly on social media and online, do not speculate as to what may have happened to Nicola,"" she said ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-nicola-bulley-search-operation-29174678
Dis Life: 'Tories' spending small fortune making poor disabled people live in penury',"Anna Morell asks when will the Tories begin to listen and stop the bone-exposing cuts that are leading to actual loss of life, as the Government spends a small fortune on trying to deliberately put poor disabled people back in their boxUniversal credit? Universal deficit more like… Do you remember Iain Duncan Smith? Architect of the Universal Credit (UC) system which was meant to make a complex benefits system easier for people to navigate and transition from into the world of work? In some cases by moving people over from benefits they could live on to less benefits they couldn’t live on (guess who – go on, guess which group was badly affected by that – yay! Disabled people again!) IDS is long gone, but the moves he put in place are still being rolled out, with most disabled people now on track to be moved over fully to UC from slightly better legacy benefits in the next two years. Many of us disabled people are not happy about this. Which is why it’s a great relief that the Court of Appeal has blocked an attempt by the DWP to overturn a High Court ruling from a year ago which ruled that two UC claimants known as TP and AR were unlawfully discriminated against when the DWP refused to repay their monthly benefit losses from being switched to UC in full.   This has been a long old bun fight. A five year fight involving four stressful court cases, during which the DWP has been heavily criticised for wasting public funds and scarce court time to fight to ensure that policies which have been found unlawful and have actively impoverished thousands of disabled people get to stay in place. It’s a complicated sentence read it again slowly: the Government has spent a small fortune on trying to deliberately put poor (financially) disabled people back in their box, to live in what often amounts to penury. Not all disabled people can work. UC is so focused on work. The government refuses to hear that disabled people can live valid, productive, non-economically viable lives that still add value to society because they are alive, and living well, and interacting with the world with parity. This country is more than an economy. Disabled people are more than cogs in the economic wheel. But we do need money to thrive. And when the money offered isn’t enough to survive, we need to ask ourselves what kind of society we are. What kind of people we are. Where the hell we left our moral cores.  Before UC, TP and AR received £178 per month to help with the additional costs of living as disabled people without a carer. House moves triggered a change from older benefits systems onto UC, meaning they lost this much money each month. Scope puts the figure for the cost of living as a disabled person, pre cost of living crisis, at around £600 per month. Even before UC, the benefit figures didn’t add up. I wonder, for those who serve in public office and do such bonkers sums, whether the reward for long service these days has shifted from a silver carriage clock to a silver dagger. Because all I see these days, with my jaw on the floor, and my work inbox overflowing with desperate emails from people ready to take their own lives as they cannot live on what they have any more, is cuts, cuts, and more horrific bone-exposing cuts. When will it end? When will government listen, make the changes, and stop these horrific cuts which are leading to actual loss of life? Prepayment meter Props to The Times for having the balls to send an undercover reporter out last week with a strongarm prepayment meter installation team. Finally, we have a non-disabled reporter writing out loud what we have been screaming about as a community for several months now – that these people are acting without compassion, sense or any sense of moral propriety on behalf of major players in the energy industry. And it took this for anyone to listen.  British Gas immediately issued statements saying that’s not how they operate, except it was, and it is, and god knows how many thousands of people now have these meters and are still stuck with them despite an Ofgem-implemented immediate moratorium on these horrifically dodgy installations. It’s not enough.  If you’ve pushed thousands of people off the cliff and they are hanging on to scrappy branches halfway down that cliff for dear life, vowing not to push any more people off the cliff is only half of the solution. Ofgem needs to demand that energy suppliers go further and uninstall these meters immediately and rapidly. If it can incentivise teams by paying them bonuses for putting them in, it can do the same for them taking them out.  That disabled and other financially poor people are shelling out between £20-40 per day on fuel is incomprehensible. The rates on meters need to be fixed in line with the rates on non-metered fuel. That people known to have less money are forced to pay above the odds beggars belief. That people cannot stay warm, in a world where we have the resources to make sure that everyone is warm, fed and clothed, is, and should be recognised as, systemically criminal. Selina shakes it up Delighted to see Selina Gomez doing TikTok make up tutorials with tremors. As a fellow hippy hippy shaker due to an exhaustion condition, it’s really refreshing to see someone going about their daily business who just happens to have the shakes. It’s not something we see in the media in day to day life, but over a million of us in the UK have tremors. Selina has said she shakes as a side effect of taking Lupus medication.   Most people are aware of Parkinson’s, but there are all sorts of reasons why we shake. It says everything that the response was one of horror and concern, because, as ever, we’re still not au fait with the social model of disability which says that what our bodies do isn’t the issue, the focus should be on the adaptations we need. I often do a little light shaking, and also sometimes shake like a headbanger doing a jackhammer impression. It’s ok. It’s just a part of life. Selina has over 45m followers on TikTok. It’s great that she can be her authentic self on social media. Broadcast media has further to go to catch up – can you name me one on-screen-tremoring presenter? It’s time. Henry VIII The National Trust has announced it is revising its representation of Henry VIII to portray him as a disabled person. Henry got crushed by a horse in midlife while attempting to knock the s**t out of someone with a jousting pole. He had leg ulceration and poor mental health for the rest of his life, with the incident also thought to have triggered obesity.  He spent the next eleven years suppressing public representation of himself as a disabled person, which is the angle the Trust is interested in – why? (Answer, because he was a massive narcissist who didn’t want to appear ‘weak’ on the world stage. Sigh.)  During this time he also managed to bump off wife number five. Which is hopefully another nail in the coffin of the all disabled people need pity narrative. Henry was a g*t, whatever was going on with his body. We come in all flavours, us crips.

Deliveroo to cut 9% of its workforce as mass tech giant jobs cull continues,"Food delivery giant Deliveroo went on a hiring spree during Covid lockdowns - but the business has now been hit as the cost of living forces customers to cut backDeliveroo is to slash 9% of its workforce - around 350 staff - becoming the latest tech giant to announce a cull. The meal and food delivery firm said roles “at all levels of the company” will be impacted. Will Shu, Deliveroo’s co-founder and chief executive, said the firm needed to “accelerate a clear path to profits.” In a message to staff, he also admitted the company had grown too fast and had failed to anticipate the scale of a recent downturn. Deliveroo, like many other tech firms, went on a hiring spree as they grew rapidly. Business boomed during Covid lockdowns. But Deliveroo, like others, has been hit as cost of living impacted customers cut back.  Mr Shu said: “In recent years we grew our headcount very quickly. “This was a response to unprecedented growth rates supported by Covid-related tailwinds. “By contrast, we now face serious and unforeseen economic headwinds. “We have also recently exited markets, meaning we do not require the same size workforce to support our operations. “Quite bluntly, our fixed cost base is too big for our business.” He went on: “I’m sorry that we have to do this. Some of our close friends and talented colleagues will leave Deliveroo as part of this and it pains me that we have to do it. “I have been through one of these processes once before. “I said then that it was the hardest thing I’d ever done, and this is just as bad. “But however much it pains me, I know it’s nothing compared to how those impacted will be feeling.”  Deliveroo confirmed that riders would not be impacted by the job losses. It added that the number of job losses was expected to be closer to 300 after redeployments. Deliveroo’s offices were closed ahead of the announcement, with staff told through one-to-one and team video meetings. It came a day after video conferencing firm Zoom said it was laying off 1,300 staff.  Amazon and Google parent company Alphabet are among others to announce big job cuts, saying the boom in business they saw during the pandemic was ending.  Research suggests more than 300 tech firms have laid off nearly 100,000 workers globally since the start of the year. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/deliveroo-cut-9-workforce-mass-29174614
Broadband and phone companies face Ofcom probe over inflation-linked price rises,"Telecom companies are allowed to increase prices in line with inflation, plus roughly 4% extra on top of this, with many providers hiking costs by up to 14.4% this year under this ruleOfcom is launching a probe into inflation-linked price rises on phone and broadband contracts.  The broadcasting watchdog is looking into whether mid-contract prices give customers enough certainty about what they can expect to pay.  Telecom companies are allowed to increase prices in line with inflation, plus roughly 4% extra on top of this, with many providers hiking costs by up to 14.4% this year under this rule.  The rate of Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation for December or Retail Price Index (RPI) for January are normally used to decide price rises. Announcing its investigation today, Ofcom said “the unpredictability of inflation rates” means customers can struggle to know how much their bills will rise by. Research conducted by the regulator found a third of mobile and broadband customers don't know whether their provider can increase their price.  Of these customers, around half don't know how this would be calculated - meaning they're unable to plan for any potential increases. Nearly half of all customers don't know what CPI and RPI measure - and for the ones that do, it is still impossible to predict how rates will rise and fall over time. Telecom providers are required to set out future price rises in contracts before customers sign up. Some give customers 30 days’ notice and the right to exit penalty-free. Cristina Luna-Esteban, Ofcom’s Director of Telecoms Consumer Protection, said: “Customers need certainty and clarity about what they will pay over the course of their contract.  “But inflation-linked price rises can be unclear and unpredictable. So we’re concerned that providers are making it difficult for customers to know what to expect. “We’re taking a thorough look at these types of contract terms, to understand fully the extent to which customers truly know what they’re signing up to, and whether tougher protections are needed.” Matthew Upton, Director of Policy at Citizens Advice, said: “Ofcom is right to shine a light on this practice, but consumers need rapid action before inflation-busting price hikes kick in this April. “As we all pull together in a cost-of-living crisis, companies should do everything in their power to help consumers. That means making pricing crystal clear.“ It comes after many major broadband and phone providers confirmed they would hike bills by up to 14.4% this spring.  You can see a full list of broadband and phone price rises here.    How to cut the cost of your broadband and mobile bill  If your mobile or broadband bill is about to get more expensive, you might be able to cut costs. If you're out of contract, you're free to leave and go elsewhere - or maybe you want to haggle down your current provider. There is also no harm in trying to haggle if you're still in contract. The first thing you should do, is compare prices elsewhere to see what other deals are available. You'll normally find SIM-only plans are the cheapest. You can compare prices by using comparison websites such as MoneySupermarket and Uswitch. Take a look at how many minutes, texts and how much data you currently use, so you can find similar plans that suit your needs. You may find you're actually paying too much right now for allowances that you're not using. When haggling, explain the better deals you've seen elsewhere then ask if the company can match or beat that price. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/broadband-phone-companies-face-ofcom-29171733

Although take note that you will need to complete your first shop by February 28.   The Asda Rewards is an app-based loyalty scheme and is self-styled as being about ""pounds, not points"".  The vouchers can be created with as little as £1, and with the maximum voucher amount at £100. A shopper's Cashpot will build up in the Asda Rewards app as they shop and you can then scan the app at the check-out. It can also be linked up to an Asda.com online account for those shopping online. People can then claim their cash whenever they choose by creating a voucher in the app.  You can also pick up extra in the Cashpot by purchasing ""Star Products"" or even by completing in-app missions. Alongside the £5 offer, Asda is introducing new Milestone missions and Star Products every week and for events like Valentine’s Day, Half-Term and Mother’s Day.   Milestones are missions that will allow you to earn Asda Pounds based on the total spend that you accumulate. According to the supermarket giant, Asda shoppers could earn £20 in their Cashpot throughout February and March with these missions.   Asda launched its rewards scheme last August and currently has over four million active users.  Last month, the supermarket announced a ""shakeup"" to its rewards app and gave shoppers more time to spend their vouchers after creating it on the app.  This time period was tripled going from the original one month to three.  Asda said the change allows shoppers more time to build up their Cashpots and lets their customers save them for a special occasion such as a birthday or holiday.

Waitrose shoppers outraged over 'tone deaf' food message in UK supermarkets,"Waitrose has defended its ""perfect for the food bank"" promotion which aims to encourage supermarket shoppers to purchase products to give to its food bank donation schemeWaitrose has been called “tone deaf” over its new ""perfect for the food bank"" promotion it currently has in stores.  The posh supermarket has been criticised for describing the promotion as ""perfect"" after putting labels on certain products to encourage Waitrose shoppers to donate them.  The Alchemic Kitchen, which is an environmental campaign group that tackles food waste, accused Waitrose of being ""tone deaf"" to the realities of people having to access food banks adding: ""normalising this helps no one."" The group tweeted: ""It’s not the product we have a problem with, veg stock is useful & this is a 'good' one but 'perfect' & 'food banks' do not go together, any more than politicians, royalty et al having a photo call at one does. Words & deeds matter."" Other Twitter users agreed with the Alchemic Kitchen's stance with one Twitter user @beverlymcfarl14 noting that the message the supermarket was sending was: ""OK for poor people, but not good enough for Waitrose customers.""  Another user @moogyboobles said: ""Oh just lovely. Normalising the failure of the government, that food banks are now part of everyday language.  ""When my children were babies I had never heard of a food bank.""  The original post highlighting the ""perfect for the foodbank"" label came from food poverty campaigner Jane Middleton.  They said: ""Is this Waitrose’s most middle-class moment ever? “Seriously, @waitrose⁩, if you insist on promoting food products in this way, you could at least check the list at the food bank donation point. I can guarantee you vegetable bouillon has never and will never be on it.” In a response to Waitrose, Jane said they took issue with the ""insensitive"" use of the word perfect.   She added: ""There’s nothing perfect about the foodbank system and a tub of bouillon (or anything else) won’t change that."" Several people did defend Waitrose saying the supermarket's ""intention"" was in the right place but it was its execution that ""was off"".  One user @upthewoodenhill said: ""Although the tone is off, these reminders for shoppers whilst shopping are important. So regularly the foodbank area is next to the exit as a complete afterthought. Should be at the entrance!"" Another @teaching_MrsE said: ""I think it's the wording. I like the idea of giving the shopper an idea of what the food bank is short of so they don't end up with 100 bags of pasta, but the way it's done here is tone-deaf."" Waitrose has defended the ""Perfect for the Foodbank"" promotion describing it as helping a “vital"" cause. A Waitrose spokesperson said: ""While no one should have to use a food bank, they provide a vital service and we're suggesting items our customers could donate to the collection points we have in our shops, should they wish."" Waitrose told Mirror Money that it wanted ""to make a difference"" and alongside its foodbank collection points. It also makes an annual donation of over £200,000 to the food bank charity Trussel Trust and has donated more than 14million meals through the charity FareShare's food distribution scheme.

Nicola Bulley police 'may be in breach of guidelines by not bringing in outside force',"Former Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner Martyn Underhill said Lancashire Police appear to have failed to conduct a peer review in the missing Nicola Bulley caseAn ex-crime chief says the force searching for missing mum Nicola Bulley could be in breach of national policing guidelines. Former Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner Martyn Underhill said in a case such as this it is recommended a second constabulary be brought in for a review within seven days. A spokesman for Lancashire Police, which is running the search for the 45-year-old dog walker, told the Mirror it is their understanding such a move has not been made. Nicola had dropped her children off at school in St Michaels on Wyre on January 27 before taking springer spaniel Willow for a walk along the river and subsequently disappearing.    Mr Underhill, who served as Detective Inspector when nine-year-old Sarah Payne disappeared in 2000, said a case like this which has attracted such major attention, there is clear advice in the Major Crime Investigation Manual. ""The recommendation is that you should get another force in to peer review what you’ve done,"" he told the Mirror. He went on to say, the prospect that the force hasn't made such a move is ""not only unusual, it also means they are going against national guidance"". ""This is a very high profile case and we don’t know what’s happened.   ""It’s extremely unusual not to seek a second opinion. If they haven’t called in a second opinion, the immediate question is why."" Mr Underhill said, from the outside, it appears they may have made ""operational mistakes"", including quickly moving to the hypothesis that it was an accident.  He explained there are several scenarios as to what might have happened to Nicola and her inadvertently falling in the river is just one. ""The guidance is there for a reason, senior cops make mistakes and you need to bring someone else in to review what’s been done,"" he said.   Mr Underhill mentioned that other prominent cases which began as missing person inquiries had been afforded the same treatment. ""And it’s been done in all the high profile cases, we did it for Sarah Payne within a week. Milly Dowler, April Jones - they have all had a second person review, it’s normal practice.""  Asked why he thinks the disappearance of Nicola has caught the public and media's attention so much, he said it's never entirely clear. But explained it can be ""something as simple as a photo that captures the imagination"", for example the school photo released of Sarah Payne. He said as well as the images of Nicola herself, there's the ""added twist of her mobile phone engaged in a work call at the time she goes missing and a dog"".  ""It’s a very unusual set of circumstances that has attracted the public’s attention and that’s why it’s now national news. ""There are people like Nicola going missing in this country every day which don’t even make the local paper but the fact is we have those three ingredients. ""Those three things together make this something that is very memorable.""  However, he said this can be manufactured by a force to a certain degree.  ""What we did in Sarah Payne, we had a deliberate strategy to keep the story in the news every day,"" he continued.  ""We kept it in national news every day and that is a very clear strategy in many missing person enquiries because the more chance you’ve got of someone phoning up or someone solving this case.  ""Or even seeing Nicola, we still don’t know where Nicola is."" Mr Underhill said the assistant chief constable did all the press conferences and engagements during the Sarah Payne disappearance, but he is unsure if there is a similar concentrated strategy at Lancashire. ""It maybe that this enquiry is now driving Lancashire Police in a way they don’t want to be driven, the fact is this has captured the public’s attention,"" he said.  ""It’s national news every day and we need to find Nicola, because we’re into the 14th day, we’re almost into the Madeleine McCann, the John Stonehouse cases where it has the public’s imagination and there are no answers. ""We had no idea what was happening with Madeleine McCann for weeks and weeks and weeks, and there are cases like this, and sadly Nicola Bulley is becoming one of those.  ""And the police need to respond to that, and they need to have a media strategy to help with that."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nicola-bulley-police-may-breach-29175075
New Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch fuels fears about collapse of steel industry,"Some steel industry insiders believe the Government is determined to 'manage decline' of the once-thriving industry amid sky-high energy costs and moves to slash pollutionNew Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch has fuelled fears about the collapse of the steel industry, claiming “nothing is ever a given” when asked about its survival. Some sector insiders believe the Government is determined to “manage decline” of the once-thriving industry amid sky-high energy costs and moves to slash pollution. Asked by Sky News whether the UK always needed a steel industry, she said: ""Nothing is ever a given."" She claimed she needed to ""sit down and look at what exactly has been going on with steel from a business perspective and an industry perspective"". Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds hit back: “Comments like this show how out of touch and lacking in ambition the Conservatives are for British industry. “Steel is integral to the net-zero transition, our national security and manufacturing base as well as being the bedrock of many communities across the UK.    “Labour will partner with the steel industry to deliver green steel and keep jobs in the UK for decades to come.”  The Mirror has been campaigning to Save Our Steel since 2015. Community steelworkers’ union general secretary Roy Rickhuss said: “Minister Badenoch may wish to forget the past but steelworkers remember well the promises that were made to them by Conservative prime ministers that leaving the EU will lead to stronger support for our steel industry on issues like energy costs and procurement. “The Minister should take note of the repeated commitments her Government colleagues made to the industry from the dispatch box. “Our ability to produce steel here in the UK is absolutely critical for our sovereign capabilities and economic growth, but this vital industry is now at risk because of Government negligence. “Losing our proud steel industry and the tens of thousands of jobs it provides only to rely on cheap imports from countries that don’t play by our rules like China and Turkey will be nothing short of betrayal.”  Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, whose Aberavon constituency includes Britain’s biggest steelworks, Tata at Port Talbot, said: "" Kemi Badenoch is a Brexit supporter, but she clearly doesn’t believe in strengthening Britain's ability to stand on its own two feet, given that failing to support Britain's steel industry would be a hammer blow to our sovereign capability.  ""Her words are also a kick in the teeth for firms determined to transition to green steel, and for the tens of thousands of steelworkers, their families and communities who are reliant on these well-paid meaningful jobs.  ""She should withdraw this comment and apologise to the steelworkers who rightly expect the Business Secretary to be fighting their corner, rather than actively undermining their proud commitment to this critically important foundation industry.” Mr Kinnock, who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Steel, added: ""Our national security and economic resilience depend on us having a strong and healthy British steel industry. “In this turbulent world, we cannot rely on importing steel from countries that do not have Britain's best interests at heart.” UK Steel director-general Gareth Stace said: ""We look forward to working with the Business and Trade Secretary of State on the strategic nature of the UK steel industry and its importance to national economic resilience and meeting net-zero ambitions."" Responding to Ms Badenoch’s comments, the PM’s spokesman said: “As you've seen from her full quote, she made clear that we recognise the importance that steel plays in the economy. “She wants to look at it both from the International Trade perspective, which she has done before, and look at what's going on domestically.” He said the Government is “committed” to the future of the steel industry and understands it “supports local jobs and economic growth”.

Estate agent quit UK in lockdown to start £24m property empire on 'new Maldives',"Richard Ashby was earning £200,000 a year selling exclusive apartments in Westminster and Mayfair to rich investors, but that all changed when covid hit the UK and lockdowns loomedAn estate agent who quit the UK three years ago because he wanted to live free from Covid restrictions has created a £24 million property empire on a paradise island dubbed the ‘new Maldives.’ Richard Ashby was earning £200,000 a year selling exclusive apartments in Westminster and Mayfair to rich investors when his world crashed three years ago at the start of the pandemic. All of his lucrative deals stalled and the 41 year old said he hated being isolated on his own during lockdown in his riverside flat in Chelsea. He searched the globe for an escape where he could build up a new business and live without Covid rules - and discovered Zanzibar. The Zanzibar archipelago is a jewel in the Indian Ocean, just 60 miles off Africa's east coast and part of Tanzania. It has long been popular with safari-loving Brits who stop off for a week in the sun after enjoying the wildlife in the Serengeti or relax after climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa’s tallest peak. It is also a haven for kite surfers.   With a warm climate and average daytime temperatures of 28-degrees, Zanzibar largely avoided the lockdowns and mask wearing which Ashby was determined to avoid. It was one of the first places in the world to open its borders to tourists in June 2020. Mr Ashby said: “I could not live under lockdown for even a week and knew I had to get out of London where the property market lost its mind for six months while everyone adjusted to Covid. “I first went to the South of France and then when the restrictions there also became unbearable I discovered Zanzibar. “Zanzibar offered almost complete freedom - no one was wearing masks and we all carried on dancing the night away in bars and nightclubs. “Covid was never really an issue and I could live the life of total freedom that I had always craved.  “I knew with the gorgeous turquoise waters, virtually no crime and a Government determined to help developers create new luxury holiday homes that I found my little slice of paradise and I started a property company so I would never have to go back to London.”  He teamed up with local developer Floton Africa and together with hus company Byshivo.com they are working on three tropical village villa holiday complexes on the island worth around £24 million.  Prices off-plan for a holiday apartment start at £48,000, rising to £130,000 for the two bedroom chalets and £140,000 for the three beds. It is a third of the price of other winter sun favourites such as Dubai, the Maldives or the Caribbean, and Brits are coming in their droves.  Around 80% of the chalets in the first project in Paje are already sold as weary sun seekers look to escape the gloom, and investors from London and other locations such as Dubai eye Zanzibar as the next winter sun hot spot. Mr Ashby said “It is a complete accident that I ended up here. If it was not for Covid I would still be stuck in London selling flats. “Zanzibar really is paradise with none of the problems you associate with other winter sun destinations - over development in Dubai and crime in some parts of the Caribbean. “It is almost completely under-developed and there are miles and miles or beachside plots with white sand like dust and the most gorgeous, warm turquoise seas which are crystal clear and are being opened up for development.  “It is like discovering St Tropez as a quaint fishing village in the 1940s before the whole world arrived or Marbella in the 1950s when the Costa del Sol was just a few beach huts outside the main towns. “We have a blank page here and an enlightened government which is determined to encourage investment and create the next winter sun paradise.” He said he has no plans to ever return to the UK and views his homeland with rising interest rates, a cost of living crisis and a Covid debt that is crippling the economy with horror.

'Drunk' Ryanair passenger saying 'darling I've only had one' is kicked off plane,"Footage shows a Ryanair passenger eventually forced off a plane heading to Edinburgh from Riga by security after trying to deny that he was drunk and saying he had only had ""one"" A passenger who told flight crew ""I only have one, one is not drinking"" was made to leave a Ryanair plane due to head for Edinburgh after looking the worst for wear. Fellow travellers looked on in shock at Riga airport as the man stood up in the plane and tried to convince stewards that he was not drunk last Saturday. Footage shows the passenger saying that he has had at most ""one champagne"".   But Ryanair staff clearly didn't believe him and asked the man to vacate the plane. He initially resists but then agrees to leave when a security guard turns up. In the footage, the man can be heard saying: ""I'm not drinking. Maybe one. Maybe a champagne. This isn't drinking, my English is very bad."" After being told to take his bag and go, the man started packing up his belongings, while saying to security who were ushering him out: ""You don't need to rush me, I understand. I'm standing up.""   One concerned passenger who filmed the ordeal suspected the man may have started drinking his duty free alcohol, reported EdinburghLive. ""Once everyone got on the plane, one of the flight stewardesses brought the man to the front of the plane and asked him how much he had had to drink. At first he pretended not to speak any English,"" he said. ""The stewardess then said he had to get off the flight. Then he said ‘okay I understand, I only had one cocktail and some champagne’.  ""Then she said that he would still have to get off the flight. He then put his bag down and sat down in an empty seat at the front and just kept repeating ‘listen darling I not done nothing bad, I only have one, one is not drinking’. ""Then a woman came down who spoke his language and English and she translated between them. I’m not sure if it was Latvian or Russian they were speaking. He said he has family in Glasgow waiting for him that he needs to get to and the female security said but that’s the case with everyone on the plane."" The passenger added that the man was not taking no for an answer and insisted that he had done nothing wrong. Security soon showed up and once again told the man to get his bag and go, to which he eventually obliged. The passenger continued: ""The stewardess then said it was not her decision, someone else had told her this man cannot fly on this flight because if we were to find ourselves in trouble he would not be in a position to take care of himself. ""The man just kept repeating ‘listen darling I only have one, one is not drinking’. A security man then came on board and just said ‘take your bag and go!’ And the man then said ‘okay I understand’ Then he went to ask something but the man shouted ‘take your bag and go!’ So the man took his bag and got off the flight."" A Ryanair spokesperson said: ""A disruptive passenger was removed from a Riga to Edinburgh flight (February 4) ahead of take-off.""

Man renovating 90-year-old building discovers hidden safe beneath floorboards,"The builder posted a picture of the mysterious safe on social media kicking off a flurry of speculation about what could be inside and why it was boarded up in the first place in Los Angeles, USA renovator was left mystified after discovering a mysterious hidden safe beneath the flooring of a 90-year-old house he was doing up. The $6million (£5m) house in the Los Angeles neighbourhood of Hancock Park in the US was being done up when the safe was uncovered. Sharing a picture of the rubble-covered safe on Reddit the builder kicked up a frenzy of excited speculation about what was inside. In the image, the safe can be seen inlaid in the floor with a numbered dial and handle visible among the dust and debris. The post quickly gathered tens of thousands of likes with 3,500 people users commenting.   Giving a little more information about the renovations, the builder explained: ""Job started in 2020 but had some set backs. Will likely take just under four years. The amount of stuff they’ve done here is insane.  ""They dug a room beneath the house for a theatre and added a 2 story (accessory dwelling unit)."" Among the comments asking for updates one user who claimed to be a locksmith shared some more information on the type of safe.   They wrote: ""That looks like a Fire king safe. Wear a mask. Most likely lined with asbestos as most safes back then.  ""However you break it open understand that there is a 99% chance that safe has asbestos lining."" This isn't the first time a secret safe has been discovered during renovations then posted about on Reddit.  Users frustrated with a lack of an answer as to what was inside with these other cases warned others not to get excited this time round.  One user wrote: ""I can't be hurt again."" Another called for the poster ""to be banned if they don’t post an update within 24 hours"". Responding to this, one commented: ""Banned is going too easy. Tried at The Hague at minimum.""  Not willing to risk going to the Hague, the original poster got back with a response. He responded: ""The owners are aware of the safe and informed (the project manager) it’s empty and instructed it to be removed and disposed of.  ""It’s possible we may open it tomorrow just to check but it’s unlikely it’s worth the time to do so considering we’ve been told it’s empty and time is money.   ""It’s the owners anyways so even the contents had value we couldn’t keep it. Sorry to have such an anticlimactic ending."" But after the poster explained the house was being done up as a summer home for the owners who live in New York, one user speculated: ""This couple has a 6M second home. ""Their version of ""nothing"" is very different from yours and mine."" It'll be up to the builder to find out.  ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/man-renovating-90-year-old-29173849
Neighbours of Epsom College 'killer' husband brand him introvert with 'time on his hands',"Chartered accountant George Pattison, the husband of Epsom College's headteacher, 'seemed older than 39, and looked and acted like someone approaching 50 not 40'The husband of Epsom College's headteacher appeared introverted and ""older than his years"", according to a former neighbour. George Pattison, 39, was found dead with his wife Emma, 45, and their seven-year-old daughter Lettie at their home in the grounds of the school in Surrey on Sunday. On Tuesday, police confirmed they had launched a homicide investigation, and said Mr Pattison legally owned a gun that was discovered at the scene. The deaths are being investigated as a possible murder-suicide, where Mr Pattison killed his wife and daughter before turning the gun on himself. The tragedy is believed to have taken place just three weeks after he moved into their new house, which he had been ""flitting between"" while a sale went through on the couple's former home in Caterham.   A former neighbour told MailOnline:""I think he may have worked at home a bit but I got the impression he had a lot of time on his hands. ""I'd see him through the window drinking glasses of red wine in his new kitchen extension."" He ""seemed older than 39, and looked and acted like someone approaching 50 not 40"", they added. Mr Pattison was a chartered accountant who was director of a management consultancy called Tanglewood 2016, according to Companies House. Accounts for the year ending October 2021 show he had taken out a £14,076 director's loan.  It comes after reports that Mrs Pattison had contacted her sister with concerns about her husband in the hours before the killings, and when she arrived at the house she found all three members of the family dead. While a gun was found at the scene, the force said causes of death will not be confirmed until post-mortem examinations are carried out later this week.  Mr Pattison had been in contact with Surrey Police just days before the killings about his gun licence in order to change his address after the family moved to the school site from Caterham.  A statement from the force said: ""We had contact with George on February 2 after he notified us of a previous change of address, as is routine.  ""Due to the short period of time between that contact and this incident, we have made a referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct."" The IOPC said it is assessing the information available to decide if any further action is necessary.  Detective Chief Inspector Kimball Edey, senior investigating officer on the case, said: ""This is an incredibly traumatic incident and we are working around the clock to investigate and understand the exact circumstances which led to this point.  ""We understand the public concern and upset, and we will clarify what we can, when we can, while respecting the right to a level of privacy for the families of those who have lost their lives.""  Mr Pattison had held a gun licence for a number of years and it was up for renewal early last year, according to the Times. The newspaper said he had not been reported to Surrey Police before, but in 2016 had contacted them to allege that his wife had hit him, before withdrawing the claim.  Mrs Pattison became Epsom's first female head in September 2022 after six years as headteacher of Croydon High School in south London.  Boarding students at the college pay more than £42,000 a year and its alumni include Conservative MP Sir Michael Fallon, broadcaster Jeremy Vine and comedian Tim Vine.

Turkey earthquake wipes out sheep as farmer tries to rescue animals from rubble,"In a video shared with the Mirror, farmer Kamil Yavuz is seen walking around his now devastated farm in Harunusagi village, in the Malatya region of Turkey where over 100 sheep diedAs many as 100 sheep have been wiped out at a single farm following the powerful twin earthquakes that struck Turkey and neighbouring Syria on Monday. In a video shared with the Mirror, Kamil Yavuz is seen walking around his now devastated farm in Harunusagi village, in the Malatya region of Turkey.  The 60-year-old is seen trudging through thick snow as she shows the destruction which happened in minutes when the earthquake struck.  ""My friends, our sheep are under rubble. We are trying to save them from under the rubble. I can't find the words to describe this,"" Mr Yavuz is heard saying in the video which shows hundreds of deceased sheep piled up among hay bales and fallen bricks.   He knows they have lost 100, but fears the true toll could be up to 300. Men are seen in the video trying to move bricks, in a bid to save as many of their livestock as possible. But the weight of the sheep plus the freezing cold conditions makes it near impossible.  Temperatures have plummeted as low as -8 in the area, hindering all rescue operations. One sheep is seen alive, baa'ing in distress while trapped and surrounded by fallen bricks, wooden poles and debris. ""His wife has been in tears all day, they can’t move the sheep anywhere because they are so isolated, they can’t get the help. Plus they’re saying they need to sort out the people first"", Mr Yavuz's son-in-law, Yucel Yavuz, says to the Mirror from his shop in Arsenal, North London.  He continues: “He’s been doing farming for a very long time, most of his life. Now half his sheep are nearly dead and he has got no barn either. This is their livelihood, gone."" At the time of writing on Tuesday afternoon, the death toll in Turkey and Syria has surged to more than 19,000 Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said the death toll in his country from Monday’s devastating earthquake has now reached 16,170 - bringing the combined total of fatalities in Turkey and Syria to 19,362. State officials in Syria said earlier on Thursday the death toll in government-controlled areas stands at 1,262, while 1,930 have been reported dead in rebel-held areas in the north-west of the country by the White Helmets civil defence group.  A total of 5,158 people have been reported injured across both government-controlled and rebel-held Syria. More than 64,000 people have been injured in Turkey. Experts have said the toll of both dead and injured is expected to continue to rise sharply in the coming days. Roads leading into quake-stricken area of Malatya, where the farm is, have been extensively damaged, blocking most vehicle transport from entering the main cities and affecting the arrival of vital aid. Malatya is some 150 miles from the epicentre, Kahramanmaraş, which shows just how wide-ranging the destruction from the double-blow 7.8 and 7.5-magnitude quakes have been.

Ghouls travel miles to take selfies on bench where missing Nicola Bulley disappeared,"Chairman of St Michael’s Parish Council Giles Phillips has said people are not coming to help search for missing mum Nicola Bulley but to simply watch.Ghouls who are travelling miles to pose for photos on the bench where missing mum Nicola Bulley's phone was found, have been slammed by a community leader who said ""This isn't a spectator sport"".   People have been seen taking selfies while sat at the spot, leaving the missing 45 year old's friends flabbergasted.  Chairman of St Michael’s Parish Council Giles Phillips has said people are not coming to help the search, but to simply watch.  The search has been underway since Nicola, known as Nikki, to her friends disappeared while walking her dog near the river in St Michael's on Wyre in Lancashire, on Friday, January 27. Mr Phillips said: ""It would be helpful if people could let the authorities do their jobs. ""We don’t want anyone to hinder the investigation. This is not a spectator sport.   ""Most of the area is private land - the public access is very minimal and can’t absorb the numbers of people who are coming every day. ""They aren’t searching for somebody - they are watching someone else search for somebody. ""We would rather people stayed home or took a day trip to the Lake District."" Nicola's friend Heather Gibbon told reporters it felt like the area had turned into a ""tourist spot"" with the number of people arriving.  Speaking on the riverbank, Ms Gibbons said speculation on social media about the disappearance had been ""hard"" for the family to deal with. She added that the number of visitors arriving in the area had made it feel like a ""tourist spot"". She told reporters: ""Up to a certain level, we understand it's human nature, it's natural for everyone to have speculation, because the truth is in this, nothing is making sense."" She added that while the ""turnout for the search"" had been ""amazing... we have noticed it does feel like some people have come to maybe use it as more like a tourist spot"". ""The truth is, if we look at it factually, no-one knows [what has happened] until we have some evidence."" Yesterday, police involved in the case, warned vigilantes to stop 'taking the law into their own hands'.  In a press conference on Tuesday, Lancashire Constabulary said it ""will not tolerate"" members of the public committing criminal offences to try and find Ms Bulley. The force also warned not to direct online abuse at people connected to the investigation. Superintendent Sally Riley said: ""We will not tolerate online abuse of anyone, including innocent witnesses, members of the family and friends, of local businesses, or of criminal damage or burglary.  ""We will be taking a strong line on that, as you would expect. ""There are some properties along the riverside which are empty or derelict.  ""Whilst it may be well intentioned that people think that that could be a line of inquiry, I would ask them to desist from doing that. ""In some cases it may be criminal if they are breaking in and causing damage or committing a burglary."" She said officers have searched derelict riverside properties with the permission of owners.

"Lottery winner's fall from glory after being caught stealing £15,000-worth of trainers","David Swatman, who won the prize on a scratchcard back in 2018, has pleaded guilty to stealing £15,000-worth of shoes while working as a delivery driver for FootAsylumA lottery winner who scooped £100,000 has fallen from glory after being caught stealing trainers. David Swatman, 43, won the prize on a scratch card back in 2018, and vowed to use the cash to follow his beloved Liverpool FC. He said at the time: ""I’ve followed Liverpool all my life but because of my job, I often have to work weekends and can’t see them play as often as I would like to. ""Thanks to this win, I can treat not only myself but my friends as well. Who knows, I could even get tickets to the Champions League final in Kyiv if Liverpool make it there!"" Swatman said the money was ""going to completely change his life"" - but five years later, he has pleaded guilty to stealing £15,000 worth of shoes while working as a delivery driver for FootAsylum.   He avoided an immediate prison sentence yesterday after admitting a single charge of theft worth £15,450 from between August and September 2020. His pilfering came to light when the company discovered a discrepancy in the number of boxes leaving the depot and those arriving in Manchester. The court heard Swatman had memorised an 'encryption lock' on the vehicles to carry out his crimes.  It is not the first time he has been hauled before the courts either. The court was told Swatman had 22 sets of previous convictions covering 44 offences, including a drink drive offence, said to have been committed shortly after the FootAsylum thefts. Max Saffman, defending, said his client was now working part-time as a window fitter, earning about £300 per week, although he hoped to be working full time soon. He pointed to his client's admission of guilt from the moment he was arrested. His Honour Judge Field KC expressed astonishment that it had taken more than two years to bring the case to court when the defendant had admitted his crime at the outset.  He said the delay had been ""extraordinary"" and meant the defendant had been living with the threat of jail throughout his wait to be sentenced. Judge Field said: ""It wasn't just one theft. It was a series of thefts that occurred as long ago as the late summer of 2020 when you were working as a delivery driver for FootAsylum. ""You used your privileged position to steal goods from your delivery vehicle for the benefit of others... It was a breach of the trust placed in you by your employers."" The judge said there had been a ""degree of sophistication"" although the defendant had not acted alone. The goods had ""plainly been stolen to order"". But Judge Field said the defendant had shown ""genuine remorse"" and had made ""frank admissions as soon as you were confronted"". He said Swatman had ""taken steps to address the problems that may have led you to make the very bad decision to steal from your employer"". The judge went on: ""I have formed the strong view by what you have achieved over the last two-and-a-half years that there is a realistic prospect of rehabilitation in your case."" Swatman was handed a 20-month jail sentence, suspended for two years. He was also ordered to carry out five days of rehabilitation activity, to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and pay £425 prosecution costs.

Turkey-Syria earthquake: Heartbreaking images show 16 babies being flown to safety,"President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's plane was used to carry 16 orphaned babies from Kahramanmaras to the Turkish capital following the devastating double-blow 7.8 and 7.5-magnitude quakesDozens of orphaned babies who were rescued from the rubble in the aftermath of the earthquakes that rocked Turkey and Syria have been safely transported to Ankara on the President's jet. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's plane was used to carry 16 babies from Kahramanmaras to the Turkish capital following the devastating double-blow 7.8 and 7.5-magnitude quakes on Monday. The President's plane has been put on standby to be used for earthquake-related operations including carrying medical teams and equipment to regions of the country.  As well as transporting critically injured people to the capital Ankara for treatment.  All 16 babies on board the flight were tragically found alone in the earthquake zones and were collected by their new foster mothers from Ministry of Family and Social Services, where they were then taken to Etlik City Hospital.   Bitter sweet photos show the rescued babies bundled up in crocheted blankets and being individually held by the rescuers on the swish plane. Two of the babies were removed from debris caused by the earthquake, meaning that they have yet to be identified.  The other 14 were being treated at hospitals in Kahramanmaras at the time of the quake but authorities are as yet unable to reach their families.   Today, the combined death toll passed 16,000.  The provisional death toll in Syria reached 3,162, while Turkey’s disaster agency said the doll there had climbed to 12,873 overnight.  More than 60,000 people are reported injured in Turkey and more than 5,000 injured in Syria. British rescue crews are still finding live victims in “survivable voids” created by the way buildings have collapsed, the head of the UK International Search and Rescue team in Turkey, David O’Neill, said. He added: ""We are still finding live victims. It is surprising, but it’s encouraging the way these buildings have collapsed.   ""The people that were recovered yesterday were very dehydrated, slightly hypothermic because of the extremely cold conditions here. They’re still alive."" But the World Health Organisation’s regional director for Europe has said the window to save victims of the earthquake in Turkey and Syria is “fast running out."" Dr Hans Kluge told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that only 22 per cent of people trapped in rubble survive for 72 hours after an earthquake, and the percentage falls rapidly from then on.

"MPs to get £2,400 pay rise in April as basic salary surges above £86,000 a year","Details of the latest pay hike for MPs comes as the Government is locked in bitter disputes with unions over wage increases for public sector workers such as nurses, teachers and ambulance crewsMPs will be handed a £2,400 pay rise from April, taking their basic salary to more than £86,000 a year. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) revealed the annual pay hike for MPs for 2023-24 today - which amounts to an increase of 2.9%. The move will bring the overall salary for members of Parliament from £84,144 to £86,584 from 1 April 2023. It comes as the Government is locked in bitter disputes with unions over pay for public sector workers. Nurses, teachers and ambulance staff are among the workers going on strike over measly pay hikes which they say have been eaten up by double digit inflation. MPs’ pay is set by Ipsa, an independent watchdog set up following the expenses scandal, which makes a calculation based on public sector wages.   Parliamentarians had their salaries frozen during the pandemic after the watchdog scrapped plans to give them a £3,000 pay rise in November 2020, which would have taken their salaries to £85,291 in April last year. The suggested 4.1% hike came as public sector workers were facing wage freezes - prompting a major outcry. But MPs' pay was boosted by 2.7% last year, rising from £81,932 to £84,144. Richard Lloyd, Ipsa's chairman, said: ""In confirming MPs pay for next year, we have once again considered very carefully the extremely difficult economic circumstances, the Government's evolving approach to public sector pay in the light of forecasted rates of inflation, and the principle that MPs' pay should be reflective of their responsibility in our democracy. ""Our aim is to ensure that pay is fair for MPs, regardless of their financial circumstances, to support the most diverse of parliaments. ""Serving as an MP should not be the preserve of those wealthy enough to fund it themselves. ""It is important for our democracy that people from any background should see representing their communities in Parliament as a possibility.""

MPs 'need six-month golden handshake to tackle poor quality of members',"Tory Charles Walker gave a scathing verdict on the quality of MPs - warning that insecurity and lack of support means many of the ""best and brightest"" are being put offMPs should be given six-month golden handshakes when they leave - a move which may clear out jaded politicians who are too scared to quit, the Commons heard. Tory Charles Walker gave a scathing verdict on the quality of MPs - warning that insecurity and lack of support means many of the ""best and brightest"" are being put off. He also said that some longstanding Parliamentarians would ""love"" to quit, but fears about finding a job after leaving stop them from doing so. Sir Charles said he and a cross-party committee believe outgoing politicians should have access to six-month grants to help them prepare for life outside Westminster. He also called for members to be given a medal in recognition of their public service.   Sir Charles, who is himself quitting at the next election, told the Commons: ""There should be better financial support for those leaving Parliament. ""Winding up a Parliamentary office with tens of thousands of bits of casework doesn't take a couple of months, it takes many, many months."" And he said that the move may lead to a clear-out of MPs who do not want to be there anymore. Sir Charles said: ""There are long-serving members of Parliament who would love to leave, but they're frightened, they're put off leaving because of the financial uncertainty... for the sake of a six month settlement grant and some financial and career advice, we may be freeing up seats which is a benefit to those who want to leave and certainly to the benefit of their constituents."" He said he agreed that a better quality of representative is needed, telling the House: ""We will never in this place struggle to attract the shrill, the loud and the raucous... but we also need the thoughtful, the considered, the intellectually inquisitive - and their numbers are thinning.""  Tory colleague Michael Fabricant said that many MPs lose their seats through no fault of their own, but because of the ""tide of national politics"".  Sir Charles was presenting a report by the Commons Administration Committee, which said MPs should be entitled to a redundancy settlement. In its report titled Smoothing The Cliff Edge: Supporting MPs At Their Point Of Departure From Elected Office, the committee said: ""The loss-of-office payment should be treated as a redundancy package when making their transition to another career. Sir Charles told the chamber that the average tenure for an MP is nine years. It said: ""Payment should not be contingent upon the completion of the winding-up tasks as this goes against the spirit of the payment and its intended function."" During its inquiry, the committee found that some MPs experienced ""financial challenges and hardship"" after losing their seats, with some waiting months for their loss-of-office money. The 37-page report published on Wednesday said that for MPs defeated at the 2019 general election, the median loss-of-office payment was £5,250 - equivalent to less than one month of their £84,144 salary. The committee found that Westminster's pay-outs compared poorly with comparable international democracies, with an ousted MP in German who has served for 18 years qualifying for £162,360 compensation. In the UK, loss-of-office payments are only paid out if the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), the body created in the wake of the expenses scandal to set MPs' pay, deems that certain ""wind-up"" criteria are met. They include issuing redundancy notices to staff, submitting all business cost claims associated with running their MP offices and paying any outstanding debts to IPSA.

LETTERS: ‘Liz Truss tanked the economy…and normal working people have to pay the price’,"Mirror reader Barry Foster says normal working people have to suffer 'while the real culprits make excuses and get away with it'. But what do you think? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.Liz Truss tanked the economy which added to the sky high inflation we are now experiencing with workers’ wages not keeping up. Rishi Sunak and his ministers say they can’t afford to give workers an adequate pay rise but companies are maintaining their high profits by putting up prices and no one is telling them to show restraint. As usual, normal working people are the ones having to pay the price while the real culprits make excuses and get away with it.

New Tory chief Lee Anderson vows to 'graft' - while on taxpayer-funded jolly in sunshine,"Controversial Tory boss Lee Anderson posed in front of palm trees as he celebrated his promotion to deputy party chairman while on a trip to Uruguay, where temperatures have hit 34C (93.2f) this weekTory chief Lee Anderson pledged to graft around the clock whilst on a sun-soaked jolly to the other side of the world. The controversial MP has been enjoying a trip to Uruguay in South America with taxpayers left to foot the bill. Mr Anderson was appointed by Rishi Sunak as deputy chairman of the Conservative Party in his reshuffle earlier this week. But the top Tory has not started the job yet as he is on a trip to Montevideo, where temperatures have hit 34C (93.2f) this week. In a video posted shortly after the announcement on Tuesday, Mr Anderson said he was ""incredibly proud"" to have been promoted by the PM.   ""I'm going to take this new role really, really seriously, grafting seven days a week, 12 hours a day for the next 18 months up until the next general election,"" he added. Rather than getting to work immediately, the clip showed Mr Anderson was in his hotel room abroad dressed down in a black T-shirt. In another post on Wednesday, Mr Anderson urged people to join the Conservative party whilst standing in front of some palm trees wearing a white polo shirt. It is understood the visit to Uruguay by some MPs on the home affairs select committee is being paid for by Parliament. The Prime Minister today distanced himself from the Ashfield MP after he backed the return of the death penalty. Mr Sunak said ""that's not my view, that's not the Government's view"" when questioned about reinstating capital punishment.  In an interview with The Spectator magazine earlier this week, Mr Anderson said he would support the UK reintroducing the death penalty. He said: ""Nobody has ever committed a crime after being executed. You know that, don't you? 100% success rate."" He also suggested using Royal Navy frigates to return to France those arriving in small boats across the English Channel. ""I'd put them on a Royal Navy frigate or whatever and sail it to Calais, have a stand-off. And they'd just stop coming,"" he said. Mr Anderson has been no stranger to controversy since being elected to Westminster in 2019, having criticised food bank users and the England men's football team for taking the knee in protest at racism. In an interview yesterday with BBC Radio Nottingham, Mr Anderson became defensive when challenged about being caught asking a friend to pose as an anti-Labour swing voter on the doorstep during the 2019 election campaign. Mr Anderson refused to reply when asked if he was dishonest. Instead, he asked the reporter 10 times if she had ever lied. When she said that she had, Mr Anderson said: ""So you're dishonest."" Mr Anderson did not respond to a request for comment on his trip to Uruguay. * Follow Mirror Politics on Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter and Facebook.

Bungling ministers pay £2.3 BILLION after allowing criminal gangs to flog cheap goods,"Tory MP John Glen, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, admitted handing over the massive sum to settle a dispute which has rumbled on for 12 yearsBungling ministers have paid an eye-watering £2.3 BILLION to the EU after a court ruled Britain had allowed criminal gangs to flood the single market with cheap Chinese goods. It follows a damning verdict after the European Commission complained importers evaded several customs duties with fake invoices and artificially low-value declarations for textiles and footwear. Tory MP John Glen, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, admitted handing over the massive sum to settle a dispute which has rumbled on for 12 years. In March last year the European Court of Justice ruled the UK had failed to bring in measures needed to tackle the import fraud between 2011 and 2017, when Britain was still a member of the EU. Mr Glen said in a written statement that the government had paid up as further wrangling would result in an even larger bill. Read More
  He informed MPs that the UK government had shelled out 2.6 billion euros to settle the case. This comprised of a 678 million euro payment in June last year, followed by 700 million euros last month - and 1.2 million euros in interest on Monday. His statement said: ""These are substantial sums but represent the final payments and draw a line under this long running case, with the UK fulfilling its international obligations."" He added: ""Whilst the UK has now left the European Union and this is a legacy matter from before our departure, the Government is keen to resolve this long-running case once and for all and is committed to fulfilling its international obligations."" Mr Glen claimed that the UK had taken ""appropriate steps"" to counter the fraud, but said increased measures had been brought in. He added that the government was ""conscious of the risk of further protracted legal proceedings"", which he said could result in a larger overall bill and higher interest payments. No10 said paying up was the right thing to do. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said: ""You will be aware that this a legacy issue from our time as part of the EU and this payment brings the long running case to an end.  ""It protects UK taxpayers from the risk of any further protracted legal proceedings and would be a potentially bigger bill.  ""So we believe it was the right thing to do and now we are outside the EU we can set out own law, including tax and trade policies that work for the UK.""

Crackdown on poor social housing named Awaab's Law after boy who died in mouldy flat,"The father of young Awaab Ishak - who died after living in a mould-infested flat - hailed plans to change the law and said public support 'stopped us feeling alone during this hard time'A crackdown on inhumane social housing conditions will be named after two-year-old Awaab Ishak who died after living in a mould-infested flat. Awaab’s Law will force landlords to investigate and fix damp and mould problems within strict new time limits.  Housing Secretary Michael Gove met Awaab’s family today before announcing the legislation would be introduced as part of the Social Housing Regulation Bill.  The toddler’s parents have been campaigning to change the law following the inquest into their son’s death. Awaab died in December 2020 after living in a damp and mould-covered flat owned by housing association Rochdale Boroughwide Housing (RBH). In November, a coroner concluded he died of a respiratory condition caused by mould.   Awaab’s father complained to RBH for three years but they did nothing to fix the issue. The former boss of the housing provider was removed from the role after the findings were published. The Government continues to block funding to RBH to build new homes until it can prove it is a responsible landlord. The Housing Secretary met the new chief executive of RBH, along with Awaab’s family, on a visit to Rochdale today. His department said a consultation on Awaab’s Law will be launched later this year to set a time limit on how long landlords have to investigate hazards and make repairs. The new rules will form part of the tenancy agreement so tenants can hold landlords to account by law if they fail to provide a decent home.   It comes after activist Kwajo Tweneboa warned that social housing is getting ""worse and worse"". He told the Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee he receives messages “every day” and “every night” of “countless situations” where people are living in appalling conditions. The housing campaigner said he sees everything from cockroach and mice infestations to collapsing ceilings and homes flooded with sewage. The Mirror is campaigning for urgent action to end the housing hell experienced by millions of people.  Awaab’s father Faisal Abdullah said: “We would like to express our thanks to Michael Gove and his team for listening to us and doing the right thing. ""My wife and I still struggle to deal with the loss of our son, but we are finally starting to feel like we are being treated fairly.  ""We hope that Awaab’s Law will help stop any other family going through the pain we have gone through. We would not wish this pain on anybody.”  He thanked the family's supporters and told the public: ""Your support has stopped us feeling alone during this hard time."" The Awaab family's legal team, Kelly Darlington, of Farleys Solicitors and Christian Weaver of Garden Court North Chambers, said: “We are delighted to see that following the tragic and preventable death of Awaab Ishak, significant and overdue changes will be made in the social housing sector, giving tenants stronger rights to challenge their landlords over health threatening hazards in their home – including damp and mould. ""The passing of Awaab’s Law will set time limits for when landlords must act, ensuring that tenants are no longer ignored and enabling tenants to hold landlords to account.  ""While these changes will not bring Awaab back, we are warmed to know that his tragic death has not been in vain.”  Mr Tweneboa said: ""It should never have taken the death of an innocent young boy to prove mould is dangerous to live with, but I hope by this, social landlords will stop blaming tenants and start taking accountability in tackling this issue which has wreaked havoc in homes for many decades. ""I also hope the family of Awaab Ishak feel one step closer to justice for their young boy. Through his story they have now been able to help so many more."" Mr Gove said: “The tragic death of Awaab Ishak should never have happened.  ""He was inexcusably let down and his family repeatedly ignored. I want to pay tribute to Awaab’s family for their tireless fight for justice over the last two years. “Today we have announced tough new laws to force social landlords to fix their homes within strict new time limits. “Those landlords who continue to drag their feet over dangerous damp and mould will face the full force of the law."" The government has already committed to a rapid review of existing guidance on the health impacts of damp and mould. New guidance tailored to the housing sector will be published by this summer.
