Nicola Bulley dive expert claims ‘gut feeling’ there could be third party involvement in disappearance,"A DIVE expert in the search for Nicola Bulley claims there could be a third party involvement in her disappearance. Peter Faulding said if his team cannot find the mum-of-two today, his ""gut"" feeling is there may be other reasons for her disappearance. The diver's claims centred around his suspicion of her phone - found on a bench still connected to a meeting - that he claims could be a ""decoy"". He told BBC Breakfast: “If Nicola is not in that stretch of river today my view is that there is a third party involved and this was a decoy placed by the river. “It could have bene placed as a decoy there is not enough CCTV to cover particular areas here the police are working hard in the background to cover everything. “It’s so unusual we’ve got no clear information to go on."" He explained he had a similar incident in the search for missing Laura Torn in 2003 where a stiletto was placed to distract investigators. Yesterday's search for Nicola, 45, focused downstream on the tidal area of the River Wyre in Lancashire but Tuesday's search will take place further upstream. The search area will include and go beyond the area where Nicola's belongings were found on a bench near Garstang Road, in St Michael's on Wyre. It is a non-tidal area of the river. Mr Faulding explained: ""If Nicola is in the river, she could have even fallen further up, we don't know. ""The key focus has been around the bench area, we have got to rule out everything here. ""We can't just go for the bench, we have got to cover the whole stretch of river to make sure there is no untoward circumstances here."" The mum, from nearby Inskip, disappeared after dropping her children off at school on Friday January 27. On Monday Lancashire Police released CCTV images of Nicola from the day she disappeared. In a statement released on Monday through cops, partner Paul Ansell said: ""I have two little girls who miss their mummy desperately and who need her back."" Mr Faulding previously told Sky News that ""none of this rings right to me"" and that it was ""my belief is she’s not in the river at all"". He is leading a team from Specialist Group International (SGI), assisting divers from Lancashire Police. The team from Dorking, Surrey, are forensic experts responsible for assisting police across the south east with underwater search operations. Yesterday they deployed sonar equipment that scans the river bed and can ""see everything that is laying down there"", he said. They are using a “high-spec” £55,000 side-scan sonar that creates an image of large areas of sea floors and riverbeds. The diver said his team can cover areas ""extremely quickly"" adding that if Nicola is in the water they will ""find her in minutes"". Lancashire Police are confident, after reviewing CCTV, that Ms Bulley did not leave the field near the river via Rowanwater. This is the case for leaving either through the site itself or the piece of land at the side. And she did not return from the fields along Allotment Lane or via the path at the rear of the Grapes pub onto Garstang Road.

Where is Shamima Begum now?,"SHAMIMA BEGUM came to public consciousness in 2015 when she left the UK to go to Syria. This is what we know about where she is based now and her attempts to return to Britain. Begum has been imprisoned at the al-Roj camp since 2019- after coalition forces defeated Isis in Baghuz. Begum claimed in a September 2021 interview with Good Morning Britain she had been ""groomed"" by members of ISIS. She said: ""I am willing to go to court and face the people who made these claims and refute these claims, because I know I did nothing in IS but be a mother and a wife. ""These claims are being made to make me look worse because the Government do not have anything on me. ""There is no evidence because nothing ever happened."" She added: ""I would rather die than go back to IS."" Asked whether she was groomed by Isis, she said: ""I think yes, I was groomed and taken advantage of and manipulated into coming."" Speaking previously, the jihadi poster girl said she would rather be in a British jail so she could access education and psychiatric help. She told the Daily Mail: ""Mentally I am in a really bad way. I need therapy to deal with my grief. It is so hard. I have lost all my children. “I have no real friends. I have lost all the friends who came with me. Now I do not have anyone. ""I would like to be at home. There is more safety in a British prison, more education and access to family.” “I hate these women and what they stand for and what they believe in and that they think they can terrorise anyone who does not share their views.” Despite her plea, then home secretary Sajid Javid revoked her British citizenship, making her ""a citizen of Bangladesh by descent"", against which she has appealed. In September 2019 her plea to be re-granted British citizenship was further rejected by Priti Patel, also a former Home Secretary who said there's ""no way"" she'll be allowed back. In July 2020, the Court of Appeal ruled that Begum should be permitted to return to the UK in order to fairly contest this decision. However, the ruling was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom - who, on 26 February 2021, ruled unanimously against her, reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal. In a 2022 interview with i filmmakers, Begum said: ""I want to be as British as possible. ''The problem is at the age of being a teenager you’re very arrogant and you don’t listen to people so sometimes you really do have to learn the hard way. “I could be used as an example, like you don’t want to end up like her. “If it stops children making the same mistake that I made of course use me as an example. “Tell the kids ‘don’t be like her, don’t become like her.” Despite her numerous pleas to return back to the UK, Shamima has admitted that she is prepared and expects to spend the rest of her life in Syria. The Supreme Court ruled in February 2021 that the 21-year-old will NOT be allowed to return to the UK. Begum cannot come back to Britain for a court case to reclaim her British passport due to concerns over the safety of the public. Lord Reed said Begum's attempt to reinstate her citizenship should be postponed until she is no longer considered a potential threat to Brits. He said: ""The right to a fair hearing does not trump all other considerations, such as the safety of the public. ""If a vital public interest makes it impossible for a case to be fairly heard then the courts cannot ordinarily hear it. ""The appropriate response to the problem in the present case is for the deprivation hearing to be stayed - or postponed - until Ms Begum is in a position to play an effective part in it without the safety of the public being compromised. ""That is not a perfect solution, as it is not known how long it may be before that is possible. ""But there is no perfect solution to a dilemma of the present kind."" In January 2021, Begum's lawyer said her bid to come home is ""strengthened"" by the court case victory of a 16-year-old girl who successfully claimed she was a victim of modern slavery. Begum and two pals – Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase – ran away to Syria in February 2015. Begum used her elder sister’s passport to flee with her Bethnal Green Academy friends. The trio flew to Turkey and then crossed the border into Syria with the aid of smugglers. Within weeks of arriving, Shamima was married to Isis jihadi Yago Riedijk, 27, from Holland. They had three children who died from malnutrition and disease. The couple were separated as they fled Baghouz, the village where a few hundred Isis fighters are holed up in a desperate last stand. Shamima ended up in a Kurdish refugee camp where she has gave birth to her third child, but this baby also passed away. Eldest sister Renu revealed that her family had lost contact with her for the “longest time” until she was found by a Times journalist. Begum was discovered by a Times journalist in a camp filled with refugees escaping the battle for the final Isis stronghold. She said she walked away from the embattled village of Baghouz because she “could not endure any more”. But she also said she did not regret joining Isis, boasting she had a ""good time"" under the terror regime and said seeing severed heads “didn’t faze me at all”. Shamima Begum is married to the convicted terrorist and extremist from the Netherlands, Yago Riedijk. The couple had three children, all of whom died. Her youngest child Jerah died in 2019, shortly after their arrival to tal-Hol. It appears they are no longer married although their status is not entirely clear. In an interview in July 2021, Riedijk confirmed he was married to Begum and that the pair had agreed to a dowry. It is understood that Reidijk is now behind bars in a Kurdish-run prison in Syria and has been added to an exclusion list. When ex-squaddie Alan Duncan managed to track him down he told the Daily Record he had met Riedijk at an unspecified ""intelligence centre"". His precise location is not known.

Nicola Bulley updates — Dive squad claim this is the ‘most baffling case’ as police river drown theory faces stern test,"THE HEAD of a specialist dive squad has claimed that this is the ""most baffling case"" as nothing was discovered during yesterday's search.  Peter Faulding, founder of Specialist Group International who are helping the police search admitted the complicated case has left him ""baffled"". He told TalkTV: ""After 25 years of doing this kind of work, after hundreds of cases, I am well and truly baffled. ""Normally you would expect the divers to find them easily. When people drown they generally go down where they are. We normally find them within five to ten metres of where they went down."" Ms Bulley, 45, a mortgage adviser from Inskip, Lancashire, vanished while walking her dog near the River Wyre after dropping off her daughters, aged six and nine, at school on Friday, January 27. Read our Nicola Bulley blog below for the latest updates... Heartbreaking footage shows more than 10 emergency vehicles parked on Shard Bridge.  The response was five miles from where the mum-of-two vanished in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire. Video obtained by The Sun Online shows police, coastguard and ambulance workers all in attendance. However, Lancashire Police later said nothing was found. Police are appealing to anyone who may have any information regarding the disappearance of Nicola Bulley. Anybody with information about where she might be is asked to call 101, quoting log 473 of January 27, or ring 999 for immediate sightings. The daughter of a man who went missing a decade ago believes Nicola’s family needs to keep pushing the police to investigate every lead. Stephanie’s father, Robert Duff, has been missing since 2013 after he failed to attend his daughter’s 18th birthday party. Now Stephanie believes Nicola’s family need to keep pressing the police to ensure all leads are investigated. Stephanie told The Sun: “My only advice and hope for the family is that they do keep on pressing the police and make sure everything is being done. “When the cops failed us, I took investigating into my own hands. “Nicola’s family need to do the same – they need to check that the police have checked everything. “I really do hope she is found safe and well.” Police revealed yesterday that an area close to where Nicola vanished was not covered by CCTV at the time of her disappearance. As a result there is a ten-minute window where police cannot account for Nicola’s movements. This is between 9.10am – the last confirmed sighting – and 9.20am when Nicola’s phone is believed to have been on a bench while connected to a work call. Superintendent Sally Riley told the Lancashire Post: “Several exits of the riverside area have CCTV covering them or exits are locked and therefore couldn’t have been passed through by Nicola. “There’s only a very small area onto Garstang Lane toward the A5/A6 which is not covered by CCTV and that’s why we’re appealing today for dashcam footage or for people who may have been walking on Garstang Lane or driving in the area to come forward if they can.” Anybody with information about where she might be is asked to call 101, quoting log 473 of January 27, or ring 999 for immediate sightings. Nicola’s sister Louise Cunningham and friend Emma have rubbished the hypothesis provided by police regarding her disappearance. Lancashire Police said previously their “main working hypothesis” is that Nicola had “sadly fallen in the river”. Police believed the mum could have walked to the river to retrieve the dog’s tennis ball when she potentially fell in. However, the pair explained there was “no evidence” behind the hypothesis that Nicola fell in the water while getting Willow’s tennis ball. Supt Riley also later admitted there was also nothing to show a slip or fall near the bench where Nicola’s phone was found. Emma said: “The hypothesis is based on limited information – I’ve said before it’s a theory – and we sadly can’t base life on a theory.” Nicola Bulley’s partner, Paul Ansell, is desperate to find the mother of his children, a friend has said. “He is desperate to have Niki home, he just wants to know she’s safe and wants her home with the family,” Heather Gibbons told Sky News. Paul and Nicola have been together for 12 years and have two children together. A friend of Nicola Bulley has revealed her children performed at a gymnastics show in front of ”an empty seat” where their mum should have been sat. The mum-of-two had bought the tickets the day before she vanished while walking her dog on January 27. Instead, her young daughters performed their routine over the weekend as the search for Nicola continued. Friend Emma White said: “They tend to do a lot of activities at the weekends, and normally Mummy would have been involved with those. “Over the weekend they had a gymnastics show and there was an empty seat, which obviously was hard, as Mummy should be watching them.” On the day she went missing the mum-of-two was wearing an ankle-length black quilted gilet jacket, a black Engelbert Strauss waist-length coat which was worn underneath the gilet, tight-fitting black jeans, long green walking socks tucked into her jeans, ankle-length green Next wellies, a necklace and a pale blue Fitbit. Police have stressed the importance of her clothes, calling on anyone who may have seen something to come forward. Friends of Nicola Bulley have defended heartbroken partner Paul Ansel, following claims made online that he was involved in her disappearance. Nicola’s friend Tilly Ann released a statement with the family’s permission to dispel the rumours. She said: “Paul and Nikki both mostly work from home which is why he was at home that day. “They have CCTV and there is a reason why Paul has never been a suspect. “Family and friends need these accusations to stop immediately. The fact that I’ve had to write this is disgusting to be honest.” Paul Ansell is the long-term partner of missing Nicola Bulley. The pair have been together for twelve years. Both Bulley and Ansell share a home in Inskip, Lancashire. Their family unit is completed by two daughters. A pal of missing mother mother-of-two Nicola Bulley has said friends and family are “pushing on” as police continue their search. Heather Gibbons told Sky News: “We are just pushing on… it’s an absolute rollercoaster.” “Nikki is just one of the loveliest people you could meet,” she said. “She is just loved, she is really kind, she has one of the biggest hearts, incredible loyal, I just can’t tell you how much of a lovely person she is.”  Nicola was last seen on January 27, 2023, in St Michael’s on Wyre, Lancashire, at 9.10am. The 5ft 3in mother-of-two was last spotted walking along a river path with her dog. At the time of her disappearance, Ms Bulley was wearing a long black gilet jacket with a hood and had her hair tied in a ponytail. Peter Faulding, founder of SGI, has said their searches today were in vain - as nothing was discovered. Speaking on TalkTV, he said: ""After 25 years of doing this kind of work, after hundreds of cases, I am well and truly baffled.  ""Normally you would expect the divers to find them easily. ""When people drown they generally go down where they are. ""We normally find them within five to ten days of where they went down.  ""This is the most baffling case that I have ever worked on."" On the day she went missing the mum-of-two was wearing an ankle-length black quilted gilet jacket, a black Engelbert Strauss waist-length coat which was worn underneath the gilet, tight-fitting black jeans, long green walking socks tucked into her jeans, ankle-length green Next wellies, a necklace and a pale blue Fitbit. Police have stressed the importance of her clothes, calling on anyone who may have seen something to come forward. Specialist Group International (SGI) today scoured the water for the mum ten days after she vanished. Peter Faulding, founder of SGI, said he is not convinced by the hypothesis that she fell into the river while walking her dog in St Michael's on Wyre. Their search ended this evening after nothing was found. Now he fears Nicola's phone could be a decoy - and there could be a third party involved. He said: ""The police have nothing to go on. ""All they have is a mobile phone at the moment and they said it could possibly be a decoy.""

The partner of Nicola Bulley has said ""we have to find her safe and well"" as the search continues.  Speaking to Sky News Paul Ansell said: ""We have to find her safe and well.  ""I can't put those girls to bed again tonight with no answers."" Police have called for anyone who may have seen Nicola Bulley before her disappearance to come forward. Lancashire Police said: “Our enquiries to find Nicola are extensive and will include speaking to as many members of the public as possible.” They added: “There will be many people who were in that area at the time who may not think they can help, we would urge you not to make that decision yourself and to come forward so we can have as much material as possible to assist the investigation.” A forensics expert has slammed police for their handling of the search for missing mother of two Nicola Bulley.  Underwater forensics expert Peter Faulding told MailOnline: “It should have been sealed off immediately as a potential crime scene. “That area is critical. Critical forensics could have been found in that location.” Peter said “loads” of people would have now trampled through the area – covering up any remaining tracks. He continued: “I don’t know how the police can say there’s no evidence of third-party involvement in this disappearance when they haven’t actually checked. “I think this is a mess, really.” Police searching for Nicola Bulley have revealed more details about the mum-of-two's final movements. They said she did not leave the field where she was walking Willow via Rowanwater, either through the site itself or via the piece of land at the side. Nicola also did not return to the fields along Allotment Lane or via the path at the rear of the Grapes pub onto Garstang Road. Officers are now focusing on a river path that leads from the fields back to Garstang Road and are appealing for drivers to come forward. Anyone who travelled down the road on that day will also receive a letter from police requesting dashcam footage. Police searching for Nicola Bulley have released a new statement from her partner, Paul Ansell. He said: “It’s been ten days now since Nicola went missing and I have two little girls who miss their mummy desperately and who need her back. ""This has been such a tough time for the girls especially but also for me and all of Nicola’s family and friends, as well as the wider community and I want to thank them for their love and support. ""We are also really grateful to Peter and his team from SGI for coming up and helping support the work of Lancashire Police as they continue their investigation. ""If anyone has any information which could help find Nicola, I urge them to get in touch with the police and help us provide the answers we all so badly need.” Police have released a new CCTV image of Nicola Bulley as the search for the missing mum continues. Nicola Bulley, 45, was last seen in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, at around 9.15am on January 27. Lancashire Police have now released further CCTV images of Nicola from the day she disappeared. The mum can be seen with her dog Willow walking towards her car as she prepares to do the school run. In a separate image, she approaches the car's open boot in the clothes she was last seen in.

Britain’s best new pubs revealed for 2023 – did your favourite boozer make the cut?,"BRITAIN'S best new pubs have been shortlisted ahead of an awards final. The Publican Awards will pit the best pub companies in the UK against one another across a number of categories. These include the venues which serve the best drinks, plate up the most succulent meals and provide the cosiest accommodation. Below are the shortlisted nominees for the 2023 Publican Awards: To be in contention for this prize, the pub must have opened during the past two years and be either a new-build pub or a substantial re-development. Entrants must demonstrate evidence of how effectively trade has been built at the site. Here's the venues shortlisted: To qualify for this section, the pub company had to have between two and 150 sites that manage to juggle both a pub estate and a successful brewery. To be in with a shot here, you'll need to run a successful brewery and/or a managed or tenanted/leased pub estate. Those nominated will have between two and 150 pub sites. This winner of this category will be the best local in the country, serving up the largest amount of pints in its area. After a bruising long walk or an aching drive with the kids in the back, this award will be presented to the company boasting excellent rooms. Arguably the most important category of them all - which pub firm is serving up the best pints and glasses of vino. With most punters entering a pub for a sharpener, this is arguably the most significant gong. Drinks retail excellence bragging rights on the table for the nominees. Pub companies that average a two-course meal (Starter/Dessert and Main) from between £12.50 to £25 per head can enter the award, which is looking for the tastiest mainstream food on offer in the country. A category for the kind of pub which specialises in only ringing for last orders late into the night and can be a vibrant establishment into the early hours of the following morning. An award for the firm which best demonstrates a significant and concerted effort to reduce its waste and be environmentally efficient.

Michael Gove steps in to let three cash-strapped areas hike council tax by up to 15 per cent next year,"MICHAEL Gove has stepped in to allow three cash-strapped areas to hike council tax by 10 to 15 per cent next year — smashing through the usual 5 per cent ceiling. Levelling Up Secretary Gove agreed to the requests from Thurrock, Croydon and Slough councils to help plug huge black holes in their finances. Gove noted “significant failings in local leadership” and “poor decision-making”. Thurrock and Slough will be allowed to raise council tax by 10 per cent, and Croydon 15 per cent. Residents in an average band D home in Croydon will see their bills go up by nearly £250 to around £2,220 a year. Every council is allowed to put their bills up by up to five per cent - but if they want to go higher they need a local referendum to give it the green light. Mr Gove ordered councils to help out those who can't afford the astonishing hikes. Councils up and down the country will get an extra £5.1billion in additional help - a 9 per cent hike in their core spending to help in ""challenging times"". John O’Connell of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: “Taxpayers will be picking up the tab for the dismal failure of their local authority to get a grip on spending. “Time and again, bungling bosses have left council finances deep in the red, expecting hard working residents to bail them out.  “Any increase in council tax should come alongside sensible savings from waste in local budgets, including top level salaries.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21297981/michael-gove-croydon-thurrock-slough-council-tax/
Nicola Bulley: Moment massive emergency response spotted five miles from where missing mum-of-two disappeared,"HEARTWRENCHING video shows a huge emergency presence just five miles down the river from where missing mum Nicola Bulley disappeared. The dog walker, 45, disappeared after dropping her children off at school in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, on Friday January 27. Since then there has been no trace of the mum-of-two, leaving her family in agony. Cops this week revealed their ""main working hypothesis"" was that Nicola had ""sadly fallen"" into the icy River Wyre. And last night local residents spotted more than 10 emergency vehicles on the Shard Bridge - five miles from where she vanished. Cops confirmed they were called at 5.51pm on Monday to the area in relation to the search for the missing mum. Video shows police, the coastguard and ambulance workers all in attendance. Their vehicles line the right hand of their bridge with their blue and white lights flashing. Nearby residents also report that drones are currently scouring the area. And drivers say the emergency workers were standing at the edge of the bridge. However, Cops say nothing has been found. A spokesman for Lancashire Police told The Sun: ""The search of the sand and surrounding area near to Shard Bridge by Lancashire Police and the Coastguard proved negative."" It comes after Specialist Group International (SGI) searched the water yesterday. However, Peter Faulding, founder of SGI, has said their searches were in vain - after nothing was discovered. SGI had offered their services for free in a bid to give Nicola's family answers and are using a helicopter to search for her. They are also using a ""top of the market"" 18,000khz side scan sonar to search the river. Lancashire Police said previously their “main working hypothesis” is that Nicola had “sadly fallen in the river”. Supt Sally Riley claimed there may have been an “issue” with dog Willow that led Nicola to the edge of the water. Police believed the mum could have walked to the river to retrieve the dog’s tennis ball when she potentially fell in.

People smuggler jailed for taking migrants OUT of Britain an hour after they arrived,"A PEOPLE smuggler has been jailed — after he was caught taking illegal migrants out of Britain. He initially sneaked 15 men into the UK from France — but after just an hour here they decided they wanted to go Spain instead. The Moroccan smuggler, who works as a taxi driver in London, was then stopped by French police in Dunkirk on January 31. They found the 15 men, all Moroccans, in his VW van. The driver was jailed in France for a year for people smuggling and aiding illegal stays. A source said of the migrants’ short stay in Folkestone, Kent: “They immediately decided they didn’t like it there, and wanted to go to Spain instead. “They asked to be taken back to France, where they were intercepted by the police, and the people smuggler was arrested.” The driver had been due to take them back to Paris, for a fee of around £180 per person. It is suspected he was part of a UK-based people smuggling gang making thousands out of the cross-Channel trade.  In line with French policy, none of the migrants were arrested and after basic checks, they were free to continue their journeys. However, with all their records taken by authorities, they face a tough task to settle in Spain, which reportedly accepts few asylum requests from Morocco. The source added: “It is a lose-lose for everyone.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21296659/people-smuggler-jailed-taking-migrants-out-of-britain/
Inside rapist cop David Carrick’s lair including tiny cupboard where monster locked victims and cameras to watch them,"PHOTOS of police rapist David Carrick’s lair emerged yesterday as he appeared in court at the start of a two-day sentencing hearing. One image showed the tiny cupboard under the stairs where the Met Police monster locked victims naked before raping and torturing them. Another was of a camera Carrick, 48, had in his lounge to remotely watch victims while on duty and relay insults via a microphone. Other snaps showed his bathroom and outdoor cameras at three-bed terraced home in Stevenage, Herts. One woman was locked naked in the cupboard — described by police as the size of a dog crate — at least ten times by the depraved Downing Street firearms cop.  Prosecutor Tom Little KC said if the woman upset Carrick, “she would be punished, sometimes by acts of violence and on other occasions she was shut in a small cupboard under the stairs.” London’s Southwark crown court also heard how Carrick sent a woman a photo of his gun while he was at work, telling her: “Remember I am the boss.” Some women were in long-term relationships with the officer. Others met him through dating sites, a sports club and wine bars, it was said. Two were police officers, a couple childhood friends and another worked as a cleaner. It was revealed Carrick raped one woman at gunpoint after meeting her at a wine bar and luring her to his former home in North London. Mr Little said Carrick used his “power and control” as a police officer to carry out “violent and brutal” attacks and deter victims from coming forward. Carrick — who worked on the Met’s Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection unit — is due to be jailed today. The former soldier has admitted 49 charges, including 24 counts of rape, against 12 women over a 17-year period.  Some of the charges incorporate multiple offences, with an overall tally of at least 85 separate crimes, including 71 sex attacks and 48 rapes, as well as coercive control and false imprisonment. The court heard impact statements from survivors.  One said she “encountered evil” — adding: “I honestly thought he was going to kill me.” Mr Little said the case “falls short of meriting a whole-life sentence” but sought a discretionary life sentence with a fixed minimum term. Carrick was sacked last month by the Met.  Outrage erupted when it emerged he had been named to police on nine occasions before finally being unmasked as one of Britain’s most prolific sex offenders. Met assistant commissioner Barbara Gray reiterated an apology to Carrick’s victims for force failings on the eve of his sentencing. The hearing continues.

Massive emergency response seen near where Nicola Bulley disappeared as ‘baffled’ dive leader says phone could be decoy,"A MASSIVE emergency response was seen close to where Nicola Bulley disappeared last night after the head of a specialist dive squad said the case has left him ""baffled"". Heartbreaking footage shows more than 10 emergency vehicles parked on Shard Bridge - five miles from where the mum-of-two vanished in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire. Video obtained by The Sun Online shows police, coastguard and ambulance workers all in attendance. However, Lancashire Police later said nothing was found. Search teams are this morning preparing to join cops for a second day in the search for 45-year-old mortgage advisor Nicola. Lancashire Police believe Nicola fell into the river while walking her dog. Specialist Group International (SGI) yesterday scoured ""large areas"" of water for the mum 10 days after she vanished.  Peter Faulding, founder of SGI, admitted the complicated case has left him ""baffled"". He told TalkTV: ""After 25 years of doing this kind of work, after hundreds of cases, I am well and truly baffled. ""Normally you would expect the divers to find them easily. ""When people drown they generally go down where they are. ""We normally find them within five to ten metres of where they went down."" He also fears Nicola's phone could be a decoy - and that he believes there's a possibility a third party involved. Peter explained: ""The police have nothing to go on. ""All they have is a mobile phone at the moment and they said it could possibly be a decoy."" SGI has offered their services for free in a bid to give Nicola's family answers and are using a helicopter to search for her. They are also using a ""top of the market"" 18,000khz side scan sonar to search the river. I can't put those girls to bed again tonight with no answers. Supt Sally Riley claimed there may have been an “issue” with dog Willow that led Nicola to the edge of the water. Police believed the mum could have walked to the river to retrieve the dog’s tennis ball when she potentially fell in. But Nicola’s sister Louise Cunningham and friend Emma have rubbished the hypothesis. The pair explained there was “no evidence” that Nicola, from Inskip, Lancashire, fell in the water while getting Willow’s tennis ball. Supt Riley also later admitted there was also nothing to show a slip or fall near the bench where Nicola’s phone was found. Yesterday Nicola's partner issued a heartbreaking voicenote on the tenth day of her disappearance. Her boyfriend of 12 years, Paul Ansell, told how much her kids are missing her. In a voicenote he said: “It’s been ten days now since Nicola went missing and I have two little girls who miss their mummy desperately and who need her back. ""This has been such a tough time for the girls especially but also for me and all of Nicola’s family and friends, as well as the wider community and I want to thank them for their love and support. ""We are also really grateful to Peter and his team from SGI for coming up and helping support the work of Lancashire Police as they continue their investigation. ""If anyone has any information which could help find Nicola, I urge them to get in touch with the police and help us provide the answers we all so badly need.” ""We have to find her safe and well. I can't put those girls to bed again tonight with no answers."" Anybody with information about where she might be is asked to call 101, quoting log 473 of January 27, or ring 999 for immediate sightings.

I left my partner for a Ukrainian refugee… we rekindled our love after breaking up – but now it’s complicated,"A LOVE rat dad who left his partner for a Ukranian refugee says their relationship is now “complicated”. Tony Garnett got together with Sofiia Karkadym just ten days after he and his partner of ten years Lorna welcomed the refugee into the home they shared with their two children. But just months later, Tony dumped Sofiia - leaving her ""heartbroken"". Then, around Christmas, the dad revealed he was again loved up with the Ukrainian IT manager and has even met her family back home. However at the weekend there was trouble in paradise once again, after he was arrested over an abuse-hurling “domestic”. Tony was escorted out of his house in cuffs and spent the night in a West Yorkshire cell this weekend after neighbours “heard screaming”. Tony told The Sun: “I was playing on a game console with my daughter. “But Sofiia didn’t like the idea of me going up there because she said she wants me to spend some time with her. “Then it became a big argument about who am I putting first in my life. “So I said ‘of course my children always come first’ and then that erupted into a big row and that was it. “There wasn’t anything major.” The incident has left Tony feeling unsure about his future with Sofia, saying “it’s complicated” Tony says he was released without being charged. The West Yorkshire Police have been approached for comment on the matter. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21295521/partner-ukrainian-refugee-its-complicated/
Sailor dies after falling overboard from fishing boat off the coast of the Isle of Wight,"A SAILOR has died after falling overboard from a fishing boat. Coastguard crews were called out to reports of an unmanned vessel off the coast of the Isle of Wight at 2pm today. On their arrival, they discovered the empty boat's engine was still warm. The chart plotter was still active and there was a fishing line over the side of the boat, reports County Press. This sparked a search of the water - and 30 minutes later an unconscious man was pulled from the channel. He was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead upon arrival at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth. The death is not being treated as suspicious. Rescue crews continued their search of the area as it was unclear how many people had been on the boat. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21296983/sailor-dies-after-falling-overboard/
Baby among three young children stabbed in horror attack as woman arrested for attempted murder,"A BABY is among three young children stabbed in a horror attack, it has emerged, as a woman is quizzed by cops for attempted murder. Cops rushed to a house on Walpole Road in Huddersfield yesterday morning after residents reported hearing screams. A girl, four, boy, two, and a three-month-old boy were found with serious stab wounds. The baby and the young girl are being treated for non-life-threatening injuries, say cops. It is understood the other lad is in a serious but stable condition. A 34-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. She was also treated for injuries. Terrified neighbours this morning told of shock after hearing screams coming from the home. Natalia Skorek, 23, who lives a few doors away from the address, said: “My mum heard some screaming around 7am. “But we thought it was the neighbours on the other side because they have kids and sometimes hear them shouting. “So we didn’t think anything of it. “It was only later we found what had happened.” Another neighbour, who didn’t wish to be named, said the woman had lived at the address with her husband for around two years and they had three children. She said: “I think the husband is a taxi driver. “One of the children is just a few months old, the other two are older.” Detective Chief Inspector Sam Freeman said: “We continue to carry out extensive enquiries into this incident which resulted in three children suffering serious injuries this morning. “A woman continues to be treated for injuries and remains under arrest in hospital.  ""Based on our investigations so far, we are not seeking anyone else in connection with what has taken place.” He added: “Officers continue to support the family involved at what is clearly a dreadful time for them. “I would like to remind residents that this case involves very young children and ask that their privacy is respected and members of the public avoid unhelpful speculation which can only increase distress for the family involved.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21296069/baby-among-three-young-children-stabbed/
Key reason why Nicola Bulley’s friends don’t believe she drowned as specialist divers with sonar comb river,"MISSING Nicola Bulley's worried friends do not believe the mum drowned as she is an ""incredibly"" strong swimmer. Police believe the mum-of-two, 45, fell in the River Wyre, possibly while retrieving her dog Willow's ball. But Nicola's friends have questioned the ""hypothesis"" as the search reaches its tenth day. Pal Tilly Ann has confirmed Nicola was an ""incredibly strong swimmer"". While another friend, Emma White, spoke as specialist divers joined the search today. Specialist Group International (SGI) - headed by forensic expert Peter Faulding - are using sonar to scour the water. Emma told Good Morning Britain: ""We hope they uncover nothing, like the police have done for the last ten days, and we hope Nicola is not in that river."" Lancashire Police said previously their “main working hypothesis” is that Nicola had “sadly fallen in the river”. Supt Sally Riley claimed there may have been an “issue” with dog Willow that led Nicola to the edge of the water. Police believed the mum could have placed her phone on the bench to retrieve the dog’s tennis ball when she potentially fell in. But Nicola’s sister Louise Cunningham has rubbished the hypothesis. She said over the weekend: ""Off the back of the latest police media update, please can I add there is no evidence whatsoever that she has gone into the river, it's just a theory. ""Everyone needs to keep an open mind as not all CCTV and leads have been investigated fully, the police confirmed the case is far from over."" While friend Emma said the theory was based on ""limited information"". She added: ""When we are talking about a life we can't base it on a hypothesis - surely we need this factual evidence. ""That's what the family and all of us are holding on to - that we are sadly no further on than last Friday. ""We still have no evidence, and that's why we're out together in force.""

New photo of Nicola Bulley and her dog on day she vanished is released as cops share major update about her movements,"POLICE searching for missing Nicola Bulley have released a new CCTV image of the mum from the day she vanished. Nicola Bulley, 45, was last seen in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, at around 9.15am on January 27. Since then, there has been no trace of the mum with search efforts ramping up today. Lancashire Police have now released further CCTV images of Nicola from the day she disappeared. The mum can be seen with her dog Willow walking towards her car as she prepares to do the school run. In a separate image, she approaches the car's open boot in the clothes she was last seen in. Police also released a heartbreaking new statement from Nicola's partner Paul Ansell. And as part of our continuing efforts, we are again appealing for anyone with dashcam or other footage to submit it to us. Our working hypothesis remains that Nicola, 45, sadly fell into the river for some reason, but we remain open minded, and we are continuing to carry out a huge number of enquiries. Our priority throughout this investigation has been on finding Nicola and providing answers for her family. They are being supported by specially trained officers. He said: “It’s been ten days now since Nicola went missing and I have two little girls who miss their mummy desperately and who need her back.  ""This has been such a tough time for the girls especially but also for me and all of Nicola’s family and friends, as well as the wider community and I want to thank them for their love and support.  ""We are also really grateful to Peter and his team from SGI for coming up and helping support the work of Lancashire Police as they continue their investigation.  ""If anyone has any information which could help find Nicola, I urge them to get in touch with the police and help us provide the answers we all so badly need.” Lancashire Police also revealed more about Nicola's final movements. They said she did not leave the field where she was walking Willow via Rowanwater, either through the site itself or via the piece of land at the side. Nicola also did not return to the fields along Allotment Lane or via the path at the rear of the Grapes pub onto Garstang Road. Officers are now focusing on a river path that leads from the fields back to Garstang Road and are appealing for drivers to come forward. Anyone who travelled down the road on that day will also receive a letter from police requesting dashcam footage. Officers have released a timeline of the missing mum’s final movements before she disappeared. Nicola began her walk along the towpath to the River Wyre at 8.43am after dropping her two children off at school. Police say around seven minutes later, a dog walker who knows Nicola saw her walking around the lower field with her springer spaniel Willow. The witness said their two dogs interacted briefly before she left Nicola via the river path. At 8.53am, the mum sent an email to her boss at Exclusively Mortgages. She then logged into a Teams call at 9.01am and was seen around nine minutes later on the upper field walking Willow. Police say at 9.30am, the work call ended but Nicola stayed logged on. At around 9.35am, the mobile and Willow were found at a bench by the river but there was no sign of Nicola. Police said previously their “main working hypothesis” is that Nicola had “sadly fallen in the river”. Private divers from Specialist Group International (SGI) are today scouring the river using Sonar. Detective Supt Rebecca Smith said: “The team working on this investigation are completely dedicated and determined to find Nicola. “As a mother myself, I can’t even begin to imagine what her two children are going through. “Please be reassured that our sole focus is Nicola and that we are doing everything we can to find her. “It is not possible to provide every piece of information to the public because to do so would detract from the investigation, but I’d like to thank everyone who has assisted us so far and for the support provided to Nicola’s family at this extremely difficult time. “They are being supported and updated throughout."" Nicola has been described as white, 5ft 3ins tall with light-brown shoulder-length hair. She was last seen wearing an ankle-length black quilted gilet jacket with a black Engelbert Strauss waist-length coat underneath and black tight-fitting jeans. She had long green walking socks tucked into her jeans, ankle-length green Next wellies, a necklace and a pale blue Fitbit on. Nicola has an Essex accent and links to the Thornton-Cleveleys area near Blackpool.

Epsom College headmistress Emma Pattison revealed ‘exciting’ future plans in podcast weeks before her death,"A HEADTEACHER found dead on school grounds five months into her post seemed enthusiastic about her future. Before Christmas, Emma Pattison excitedly told pupils how much she had loved her first few weeks at the helm of Epsom College, Surrey, and that ""there is so much to come"".  The 45-year-old said on the school's podcast that she couldn't wait to experience her first Founder's Day, where students, parents, staff and alumni enjoy picnics and games. She also described the annual pancake race, prize-giving ceremony and regular fine-dining soirees as events to look forward to - and revealed she hoped to bring the school's houses and year groups together more often.  But only two months later, the ""wonderful"" headmistress was found dead on-site along with her accountant husband George, 39, and seven-year-old daughter Lettie.  Police said they are not seeking anyone else in connection with the ""isolated"" incident at the £42,000-a-year school, but an investigation is underway to establish the circumstances. Officers remain on the scene, where gunshots were heard hours earlier and the nearby rifle range forms part of the corden, The Telegraph reports.  The discovery in the early hours of Sunday morning has left the community shaken and heartbroken. The college is open as normal, but tearful pupils were this morning marshalled through the police-guarded gates and to class. They were to attend chapel services throughout the day and be offered counselling, a spokesperson said. A staff member told The Sun before the morning bell: ""Today will be difficult for everyone."" Emma, who was raised on a farm in Lincolnshire, was appointed the first female head at Epsom College in September 2022 after six years at Croydon High School in South London.  She said at the beginning of December: ""I am absolutely loving my time here so far.  ""It has been very, very busy, but absolutely wonderful."" Emma said that after speaking to other staff, pupils and parents at the school, she was delighted by what was to come. ""There is so much to look ahead to and be excited about,"" she added. ""I'm not sure [I can pick one thing]. There is so much to come."" The only suggestion of any difficulty was that the move had put pressure on her family and she found it tricky to find time for herself.  Emma told three sixth form students: ""In terms of transition, it’s been a really big change for my family.  ""So we’ve obviously moved house, we’ve got a dog, I’ve got a new job, my husband’s got a new job, which wasn’t meant to happen but did, and my daughter has started at a new school. ""So there’s been a lot of change for us as a family, but it’s been wonderful."" When asked what she liked to do in her free time, the mum scoffed: ""Free time?!"", to giggles in the background. She hinted that between having breakfasts and lunches with students, attending sports matches on Saturdays and making meeting as many mums and dads as she could ""a priority"", there was little time to pursue hobbies.  She did, however, go on to say that she enjoyed travelling, reading, playing the piano and singing - as well as going for jogs. ""The kinds of things I like doing now that I am a little older are about things that I enjoy and help me relax rather than the pursuit of excellence anymore,"" Emma, whose mum was also a teacher, added.  A former neighbour told The Times they often heard piano music coming from the house and saw her going out for regular runs.  Emma, who ditched a post-university graduate scheme at Thomas Cook for teaching, detailed her career in education, which began in 2002 at Lutterworth College, South Leicestershire, where she taught French and Spanish.  She went on to have stints at Caterham School and Guildford High School, both in Surrey, before moving to St John's School, also in the county. Three years later, she became head at Croydon High School where she ""learnt so much"", then she relocated to Epsom last year to ""use that knowledge and skill and apply it to something different"". ""I’m someone that likes to feel I’m moving forwards,"" she said on the Epsom Insights podcast.  ""I like planning, I like strategy, and I suppose the scope of the college here is a little bigger than where I was before and I found that an exciting prospect."" Speaking after her appointment was made public in January 2022, Emma said: ""It is a school I have long admired, with an enviable reputation, and George and I can’t wait to meet the pupils, parents and staff and to become part of this wonderful community. ""It is our intention to make our home and our school equally as welcoming in the months and years to come."" One of her ambitions for the school was to bring together older and younger students across different houses.  Colleagues and friends described Emma as a ""wonderful teacher"" and ""delightful person"" who ""enriched children's lives"".  Dr Alastair Wells, chairman of the board of governors at Epsom College, said: ""On behalf of everyone here, I want to convey our utter shock and disbelief at this tragic news. ""Our immediate thoughts and condolences are with Emma's family, friends and loved ones, and to the many pupils and colleagues whose lives she enriched throughout her distinguished career. ""Emma was a wonderful teacher, but most of all she was a delightful person. ""In time we will commemorate Emma and her family, in the appropriate way, and in line with the wishes of her family. ""But for now, we ask that we are all given the time, space and respect we need to come to terms with this tragic loss."" Cheryl Giovannoni, chief executive of the Girls' Day School Trust (GDST), said: ""Emma was a much loved and respected member of the GDST community, as well as a talented Head and teacher, and a dear friend to many of us.  ""She touched the lives of all of us with her energy, wisdom and kindness during her six years as Head of Croydon High School and the school will always bear the legacy of her inspiring leadership."" And Julie Keller, head at Nottingham Girls' High School said her life was ""richer for having Emma as a friend and colleague"".  ""The world is certainly poorer for her loss,"" she added.  Epsom College won the top prize at the Independent Schools of the Year Awards 2022, with judges calling it a ""beacon of excellence"". The school was also named the winner of the Student Wellbeing Award at the October ceremony thanks to its ""whole-school approach to mental health and the wellbeing of both its staff and pupils"". More than 850 boys and girls attend the school, which was founded in 1853, and its acting head has been listed as Paul Williams. Its alumni include Conservative MP Sir Michael Fallon, broadcaster Jeremy Vine and comedian Tim Vine. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21293169/epsom-college-emma-pattison-excited-plans-death/
"RAF plane in ‘near miss’ with ‘hollow-centred UFO’, investigation finds","AN aircraft almost collided with an ""unknown object"" shaped like a doughnut over the North East, an investigation has revealed.  Crew members aboard an RAF Atlas were out on a training exercise when they spotted the item with a hollow centre at high altitude.  It shot past the right side of the plane before passing the windows of the flight deck, just a few feet from the wing tip. The crew, who had been flying over Currock Hill in Tyne and Wear at 1pm on November 16, described it as circular with a hollow centre, like a doughnut. It was believed to be a kind of drone.  An investigation by the UK Airprox Board detailed how it was dark in colour and 2ft or 3ft in diameter. The probe determined that ""providence had played a major part in the incident and/or a definite risk of collision had existed"". The board found that at points there had been a distance of less than 1ft between the four-engine aircraft and the object.  A report read: ""The Atlas pilot reports they had just completed instrument approach training at Newcastle and were climbing out to route towards Humberside. ""After the last approach, they had been cleared to climb ahead to FL90.  ""During the climb, they received radar vectors from Newcastle ATC before being cleared on navigation to Humberside. ""During one of the radar vectors, in a left turn passing through about south at FL75, one of the crew members on the flight deck alerted the rest of the crew to a drone that was ahead and just to the right of the nose. ""Other crew members then saw the object as it passed quickly down the right-hand side.  ""There was no time for the crew to react."" The ""circular drone"" was assessed to have passed level with the flight deck windows and ""a few"" feet from the wing tip.  ""The incident was reported to Newcastle Air Traffic Control. It was noted that, had the aircraft not been in a turn at the time, there would have been a very high chance of collision with the drone,"" it concluded.

We live in Call the Midwife town – it looks flashy on TV but the posh portrayal couldn’t be further from the truth,"RESIDENTS in a town used for the BBC's hit series Call the Midwife say its posh on-screen portrayal couldn’t be further from reality. Chatham, in Kent, boasts historic dockyards dating back to the mid-16th Century - complete with period buildings and cobbled roads. It forms the perfect backdrop for the show, based on midwives working in London's East End in the late 1950s and 60s. But scenes like the Admiral's House, the maternity hospital in the BBC drama, is a far cry from the crime-stricken reality of the Medway town's high street - just a mile up the road. ""C**p"", ""unsafe"" and ""full of druggies"" were just a few choice words residents coined when asked to describe Chatham. Grandma Mrs Brown, from nearby Rochester, was waiting for her daughter outside Primark, when she revealed: ""There have been fights with knives in the street. ""It’s not a very nice place to come, you feel unsafe here - I wouldn’t come down here on my own late afternoon."" Her daughter, mum-of-four Emma Walsh, told The Sun Online she has seen brawls with chairs getting flung and doesn’t like her teenage kids coming into town. The 39-year-old, also from Rochester, explained: ""It seems to be where a lot of gangs hang out, no matter what age you are it’s not safe."" While David Baverstock, 72, from the Princes Park area blasted: “It’s c**p! There is nothing here for anybody, let alone the kids."" Twelve season Call The Midwife have run since 2012 and boasts Jessica Raine, Miranda Hart and Helen George among its all-star cast. Brimming with throwback costumes and bucolic scenes of midwives cycling through clothes line hanging streets, filmed in the docks, the drama reflects a radically different world to 21st Century Chatham. Boarded-up stores litter the once ""thriving"" high street, which residents say has ""nothing"" to lure tourists flocking to the docks for film set tours. Mum-of-one Hope Beard, whose lived in Chatham 30 years, says it should come as no surprise given mobile phone and vape shops are ""two a penny"". The Chihuahua owner, whose own son ""hates"" the town, added: “The docks? definitely. Tourists wouldn’t come here, not at all."" The comments fly in the face of a £14.4 million Levelling Up cash injection the Government says will “transform Medway into a leading creative destination”. The money is going into artistic spaces, including dance studios, across the area. In the carpark of Wickes building merchants, pals Brian Egan and Chris Scammell were loading cement into their car to do up the former’s house. Brian, 76, who briefly worked in the docks before its 1984 closure, said: ""No-one in their right mind goes into the middle of Chatham. It’s grotty. It is a disaster."" Chris Scammell said his dad and uncle were employed in the docks before it shut, adding: ""Now it’s just a general decline in everything."" At The Thomas Waghorn Wetherspoons pub, Sammy Pearmain, mum Caz and mate Jamie-Lea Harding were having a catch up. There ain't no ‘Garden of England’ around here Sammy Pearmain, a 27-year-old mum of three, from Rochester, said Chatham was “full of druggies"" while Caz blasted it as ""the worst part of Kent"". ""There ain't no ‘Garden of England’ around here"", she added, referencing the county's motto. But NHS community nurse Bissy couldn't be more proud to live in Chatham, praising it for having ""everything you need"". The mum, who's lived in a flat on the high street for three years, said: ""It’s not that bad, nothing has happened to my flat, it has been a very peaceful place for me."" The positive reviews continue down in the docks where Francis Kelly has lived ""peacefully"" for 20 years surrounded by history. Speaking over the hum-drum of Steve McQueen's film crew as they shoot upcoming WW2 flick 'Blitz', she said to live amongst the ""hustle and bustle"" of cinema is ""fantastic"".. The 71-year-old added: ""Every now and then King Charles comes and visits and we have the opportunity to meet him.” The same sentiment was echoed by Rob Dunsmore, 76, who enjoys the annual 1940s weekend at Chatham Historic Dockyard. “If you move here, you know what you’re buying into so it’s sort of your own fault if the film stuff bothers you"", he said.

Grieving dad GUILTY of trying to kill man with machete after blaming him for his son’s death,"A GRIEVING dad has been found guilty of trying to kill a man he blamed for his son's death in an ""eye for an eye"" attack. Samson Price, 48, left Patrick Brown ""millimetres from death"" as he hacked at him with a machete outside a gym in Northwich, Cheshire. Price had blamed Brown for the death of his son Samson Price Jr, 18, who found dead in a pond in Wigan in October 2020. Fuelled by revenge, the dad launched into a frenzied attack on Brown, who was with the teen at the time of his death. Price has now been found guilty attempted murder following a trial at Chester Crown Court. Jurors were told the dad bought a 16-inch machete and electronic tracking device to locate Brown. In September 2021, he lay in wait outside the PureGym before frantically slashing at Brown in front of horrified gym-goers. As Brown attempted to flee, Price screamed ""I'll kill you"" and continued raining blows on his rival. He severed Brown's femur bone and only just missed a major artery, which would have caused him to bleed out within minutes. Price then fled the scene and evaded police for three weeks before eventually handing himself in. Prosecutor Simon Mills said: ""Samson Price intended to kill Patrick Brown, and he came very close to succeeding. ""Patrick Brown’s survival was a matter of sheer luck, and prompt medical care."" The court was told Price's son had drowned in a pond near the family home in Wigan, Greater Manchester. Brown and two other teens were arrested on suspicion of murder after Price found his son's body. But a police probe found the death was accidental as there was evidence the group was taking LSD and Samson Jnr had wandered away alone. Price attempted to claim he did not want to kill Brown but instead ""give him a day of hell"". He told jurors during his evidence he wanted to leave him with scars to remind him of his son's death. Price said:"" He seemed to be happy and was talking to someone on his phone. I was struck by the unfairness of it all. I decided to punish him but not once did I think I was trying to kill him. ""I did not want to kill him but an opportunity presented itself to inflict pain and cause physical scarring which would last for the rest of his life.  ""At no point was I intending to kill him. He was the only person who could tell us what happened to our son. ""I wanted to give him a day of hell. I wanted him to have the worst day of his life. I did not decide to act as judge, jury and executioner."" Price will be sentenced on March 23. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21294382/dad-guilty-machete-attack-son-death/

Sonia Ekweremadu, 25, Ike Ekweremadu, 60, and Beatrice Nwanneka Ekweremadu, 55, allegedly trafficked the 21-year-old from Lagos in Nigeria. They are accused of wanting to harvest his organs for Sonia, who suffers from kidney failure and requires dialysis. The Old Bailey was told the couple were ""significant figures"" in Nigerian society and had a ""significant degree of wealth"". Ike Ekweremadu was a senior senator in the Nigerian Parliament, it was said. But prosecutor Hugh Davies KC said: ""There are, however, certain things that money and status cannot guarantee in any family and they include good health."" Jurors heard Sonia's kidney condition was ""deteriorating"" and she needed a transplant to cure her. The trio allegedly hatched a plan to bring a poor street trader from Nigeria to the UK to harvest his organ. They found a donor who was making a few pounds a day selling telephone parts from a cart in public markets, it was said. Jurors heard the family then transported him to London in February 2022 with an agreement to pay up to £7,000 and a promise of a better life. Once here, the man was coached to give false answers to doctors at the Royal Free Hospital - including claiming Sonia was his cousin. But the court was told he had a ""limited understanding"" of why he was visiting the hospital and was ""relieved"" when told the procedure would not go ahead. The Ekweremadus deny conspiring to arrange or facilitate the travel of the young man with a view to exploitation between August 1, 2021, and May 5, 2022. Their alleged medical ""middleman"" Dr Obinna Obeta denies the same charge. The trial continues. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21292105/couple-traffick-uk-organ-plot/
"Nicola Bulley: Phone found by river in missing mum case could be a DECOY, fears head of specialist dive squad","THE head of a specialist dive squad searching for Nicola Bulley fears her phone found by the river could ""be a decoy"". Specialist Group International (SGI) yesterday scoured the water for the mum ten days after she vanished. Lancashire Police believe Nicola, 45, fell into the river while walking her dog in St Michael's on Wyre. Peter Faulding, founder of SGI, said he is not convinced by the hypothesis. Their search ended this evening after nothing was found.  Now he fears Nicola's phone could be a decoy - and there could be a third party involved. He said: ""After 25 years of doing this kind of work, after hundreds of cases, I am well and truly baffled. ""When people drown they generally go down where they are. ""We normally find them within five to ten metres of where they went down even after a few days. ""This is the most baffling case that I have ever worked on. ""The police have nothing to go on. ""All they have is a mobile phone at the moment and they said it could possibly be a decoy."" SGI have offered their services for free in a bid to give Nicola's family answers and are using a helicopter to search for her. They are also using a ""top of the market"" 18,000khz side scan sonar to search the river. The missing mum's friends have spoken of their hope at the specialist team giving her family some closure. Pal Emma White told ITV's Good Morning Britain: ""We hope they uncover nothing, like the police have done for the last 10 days, and we hope Nicola is not in that river."" Lancashire Police said previously their “main working hypothesis” is that Nicola had “sadly fallen in the river”. Supt Sally Riley claimed there may have been an “issue” with dog Willow that led Nicola to the edge of the water. Police believed the mum could have walked to the river to retrieve the dog’s tennis ball when she potentially fell in. But Nicola’s sister Louise Cunningham and friend Emma have rubbished the hypothesis. The pair explained there was “no evidence” that Nicola fell in the water while getting Willow’s tennis ball. Supt Riley also later admitted there was also nothing to show a slip or fall near the bench where Nicola’s phone was found. Anybody with information about where she might be is asked to call 101, quoting log 473 of January 27, or ring 999 for immediate sightings.

"‘Shots heard’ before Epsom College head Emma Pattison found dead with husband & daughter, 7, as gun range ‘cordoned off’","GUNSHOTS were heard before the bodies of a headteacher, her husband and seven-year-old daughter were found on school grounds, it is reported.  Emma Pattison, 45, her partner George Pattison, 39, and young Lettie were discovered at Epsom College, Surrey, in the early hours of yesterday. A source told The Telegraph a member of staff living nearby raised the alarm at around 1am. The Pattison family home is understood to be surrounded by other properties occupied by teachers and school workers.  It is just yards from the college's indoor rifle range, which appeared to be cordoned off this morning.  No live ammunition is kept on the premises, an insider claimed.  Cops said they are not seeking anyone else in connection with the ""isolated"" incident at the £42,000-a-year school, but an investigation is underway to establish the circumstances of deaths.  Epsom College remains open as normal, but pupils were this morning marshalled through the gates and to class.  They will attend chapel services throughout the day and counselling will be made available to all, a spokesperson said. A staff member told The Sun before the morning bell: ""Today will be difficult for everyone."" The sudden death of the headmistress and her family has sent shockwaves through the school and community.  Dr Alastair Wells, chairman of the board of governors at Epsom College, said: ""On behalf of everyone at Epsom College, I want to convey our utter shock and disbelief at this tragic news. ""Our immediate thoughts and condolences are with Emma's family, friends and loved ones, and to the many pupils and colleagues whose lives she enriched throughout her distinguished career. ""Emma was a wonderful teacher, but most of all she was a delightful person. ""In time we will commemorate Emma and her family, in the appropriate way, and in line with the wishes of her family. ""But for now, we ask that we are all given the time, space and respect we need to come to terms with this tragic loss."" Emma was appointed the first female headteacher at Epsom College in September 2022 after six years at Croydon High School in South London. Late last year, she shared that her family had faced ""really big changes"" during the transition period - including two new jobs, a new house, a new school for Lettie and a new puppy. She told sixth form students on the school podcast Epsom Insight: ""It has been a really big change for my family.  ""We've obviously moved house, we've bought a dog, I've got a new job, my husband's got a new job which wasn't meant to happen but did, and my daughter has started a new school. ""There has been a lot of change for us as a family, but it has been wonderful."" The ""gorgeous"" pup, a Labrador called Bella, joined the family days before the episode was recorded. Emma recalled how Bella ""barked all night"" in the days that followed, forcing her to apologise to her neighbours. Epsom College won the top prize at the Independent Schools of the Year Awards 2022, with judges calling it a ""beacon of excellence"". The school was also named the winner of the Student Wellbeing Award at the October ceremony thanks to its ""whole-school approach to mental health and the wellbeing of both its staff and pupils"". More than 850 boys and girls attend the school, which was founded in 1853, and its acting head has been listed as Paul Williams.

UK weather forecast: Icy -6C blast brings freezing fog and frost in chilly start to the week,"AN ICY blast is set to bring freezing fog and frost and temperatures will plunge to -6C. Brits are braced for sub-zero temperatures and frozen conditions as forecasters warn of a coming cold snap. The mercury is predicted to drop as low as -6C tonight in rural parts of southern England and Wales, according to Met Office forecasts.  It is then expected to warm up tomorrow, before dropping to -3C in Chard, Somerset early on Wednesday morning. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a warning about the ""serious consequences"" this week's cold weather could have for the health of vulnerable people. A yellow weather warning for wind is in place on Wednesday in north-west Scotland as gusts of up to 75mph batter the coast. The warning lasts from midday to 6pm, with travel disruption and plane and ferry cancellations ""likely"". Coastal communities could also be affected by spray and large waves. Clear spells today are forecast to lead into widespread frost and freezing fog across southern areas, while rain and strong winds blast the North West, according to the Met Office. Other areas are set to see cloudy but dry weather into tomorrow. Into the middle of the week, dry conditions are predicted, though the Environment Agency still has 12 active flood alerts, meaning that flooding is possible. These are largely concentrated in southern areas and related to groundwater flooding, where the ground cannot absorb any more water and so rainfall sits on the surface. Daytime temperatures are forecast to hover above zero, with highs up to 10C in parts of northern Scotland by Friday. Today is expected to be the coldest day, with a low of -6C accompanied by a blanket of frost across the South, the Midlands and into parts of the North West. Met Office meteorologist Dan Stroud said late last week: ""We are expecting a cold front to sink south during the course of Saturday and it is going to really help clear the clouds. ""It is going to allow overnight temperatures to dip below zero and we are likely to see an increasing risk of overnight frost as we move into the early part of next week. ""Wrap up warm and close your curtains in the evening to help keep in the heat."" A spokesperson for the Met added today: ""It’ll be a dry week for much of the UK, with high pressure largely dominant to the south and some incursions of showers and more unsettled weather into the North West through the week. ""Tonight there’s a chance of some widespread frost for the south of England with some fairly widespread sub-zero temperatures. ""By late Tuesday night, winds will start picking up in the North West. Although exact timing is uncertain at the moment, these gusts late on Tuesday and early Wednesday could be around 75mph in exposed coastal areas of the North West. ""By the weekend, the current outlook is a little more unsettled with breezy conditions expected, as well as some cloudier skies, albeit still relatively dry for most in the South."" The UKSHA has advised that if people are unable to heat their whole home, they should heat the living room in the day and the bedroom just before going to sleep.

Met police rapist David Carrick held gun to victim’s head & told another he would be ‘last thing she saw’,"A SADISTIC Met Police officer held a gun to a victim's head and told another he would be the ""last thing she saw"" in a 17-year reign of terror. David Carrick, 48, tortured his victims as he abused his position in the police to ""charm and beguile"" them. The monster locked women naked in a cupboard under the stairs for ten hours at a time, controlled what they ate and branded them his ""slaves"". He was revealed as one of the UK's worst serial rapists last month after admitting 49 charges - including 24 counts of rape. Some of the multiple-incident counts relate to at least 85 separate offences -including at least 71 sexual offences and 48 rapes. Shockingly, it also emerged Carrick came to police attention nine times before his arrest after rape and domestic violence allegations were made against him. At the start of his two-day sentencing hearing today, the predator's evil crimes were revealed for the first time. Southward Crown Court was told Carrick would ""often humiliate his victims in a number of different ways"". He used his police baton and handcuffs during attacks and sent one victim a photo with a work-issue handgun, saying: ""Remember I am the boss"". Two women were kept in the tiny cupboard under his stairs while others were urinated on or hit with a belt. He put his hands around one victim's throat and told her he was ""going to be the last thing she saw"" and ""brandished"" a knife at another. Prosecutor Tom Little KC told how he invited one woman back to his home after claiming he was the ""safest person that she could be with and that he was a police officer"". Once there, he told her ""she couldn't go"" and ""grabbed her by the hair and put his hand round her mouth, dragging her backwards"". The prosecutor said: ""He threw her on the bed. He held her down. He grabbed her arms. He had taken his shirt off. She bit his arm and he put his hand behind the bed. ""He searched for something and then put a black handgun to her head and said to her 'you are not going'. ""She froze"". Carrick also attacked another as she sat on the toilet after developing a sick interest in ""urination for sexual gratification"". And he offered a victim he raped five times £1,000-a-month to be his ""s**t"" as he coercively controlled her. She recalled how in one attack, she was ""sweating from the pain and crying"" and said Carrick would watch her remotely after making her cut ties with her family and friends. The woman was left feeling suicidal and dropped from a size 14 to a six after Carrick controlled how much she ate. In another chilling encounter, he stood naked and waved goodbye to a victim he raped ""as if nothing had happened"". Controlling Carrick also told a victim she ""belonged to him and that she must obey him"" - including with the clothes she wore and what she spent money on. He threatened the woman with a police baton and ""punished"" her by shutting her in the cupboard under the stairs. She told how she would scream out in pain while being repeatedly raped by Carrick but didn't tell anyone as the fiend was a ""police officer and very powerful"". Describing Carrick's 17-year reign of terror, Mr Little KC said: ""If the offending had to be accurately and fairly summarised, it was systematic. ""It was catalogue of violent and brutal sexual offences perpetrated on multiple victims, whether he was in a controlling or coercive relationship with them or not, or even if it was just a single occasion. ""The reality was that it did not matter who the victim was, the reality was, if he had the opportunity, he would rape them, sexually abuse or assault them and humiliate them. ""Some of his victims were either appreciably older or younger than him - they were all, in their own ways, vulnerable."" Carrick worked for the Met's Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command unit - the same department as Sarah Everard's killer Wayne Couzens. It is not clear if the pair knew each other while working at the elite unit at the same time. The gun cop, whose colleagues branded him ""B*****d Dave"", met some of his victims on dating apps such as Tinder and Badoo. He would flash his warrant card to lure the women into a false sense of security and told them: ""I’m a police officer, you can trust me”. The monster also boasted about meeting the Prime Minister in his role guarding parliamentary, government and diplomatic buildings. Evil Carrick would appear charming at first before spending time ""developing relationships to sustain his appetite for degradation and control"". He forced women to clean his home naked, carried out degrading acts against them, cut them off from family including their children and whipped them with belts. One victim was forced into a tiny cupboard smaller than a dog crate, while others were forced to perform sex acts until they ""fought for breath"". Carrick also controlled how much they ate and when they slept, telling them: “You’re only allowed to eat this much of an apple today”. The monster would abuse his position in the police to terrify his victims into silence. The women ranged from a school pal to a previous abuse victim, with some abused at the home in Stevenage he shared with his pet snake. Another victim claimed she was attacked after she woke up naked and covered in a sick in a hotel following drinks with Carrick in St Albans. Carrick allegedly raped her while calling himself a ""dominant b*****d"". She came forward after seeing another case of a rapist police officer, but the offence against her has been left to lie on the court file. When officers swooped on his home, Carrick told them ""not again"" before giving a ""no comment"" interview. Carrick was described as ""very persuasive but also manipulative"" to the point of being ""cocky"". He first served in the Military before becoming a Met Police officer from August 2001. Eight years later, a domestic abuse complaint was made against him but no further action was taken. The woman who made the allegation is one of the 12 victims. In 2019, Carrick was accused of assault and criminal damage but again, no action was taken. He was also cleared to return to work just weeks after first being accused of rape. The predator was not even subjected to a fresh round of vetting as a result of the July 2021 rape allegation. And he passed vetting back in 2001 despite being accused of burglary and malicious communications when a relationship ended. The Met has now referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) and apologised for not stopping him sooner. In total, Carrick pleaded guilty to 49 offences against 12 women including 24 rapes between 2003 and 2020. He also admitted nine counts of sexual assault, three charges of coercive and controlling behaviour, two attempted rape, one count of indecent assault and three of false imprisonment. Carrick further pleaded guilty to five counts of assault by penetration, one count of attempted sexual assault by penetration and one of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent. He denied a count of rape in September 2020 relating to a 13th woman but the CPS decided it was not in the public interest to proceed to trial on that charge. Assistant Commander Barbara Gray, the Met's lead for Professionalism, said: ""It is nearly three weeks since David Carrick entered the last of his guilty pleas. ""In doing so, he admitted to the most appalling offences against women. ""I am truly sorry for the harm and devastation he has caused them. We let them down and we failed to identify a man in the ranks of the Metropolitan Police Service who carried out the most awful offences. ""He should not have been a police officer."" The sentencing hearing continues.

Who was Lynette White and what happened to her?,"THE murder of Lynette White in 1988 led to one of Britain's most notorious miscarriages of justice. Her killer was finally jailed in 2003 after 15 years. But what else do we know about her and the murder? Lynette White was murdered on February 14, 1988, in her docklands flat in Cardiff. Before the fatal incident, the 20-year-old had been working as a prostitute in the city centre. Five days before her murder, White went missing and made no contact with any of her friends or known associates. The reason for her disappearance during this period has never been ascertained. She was due to be called as a witness for the prosecution in two forthcoming trials but was reportedly ""laying low"". On the evening of February 14, police forced entry into a flat on James Street as they searched for the missing witness and found Lynette's body inside. She had been stabbed more than 60 times by an unknown assailant. After the murder, South Wales Police issued a photofit image of a bloodstained, white male seen near the scene of the crime but were unable to trace him. In November 1988, police charged five black and mixed race men with Lynette's murder despite having no scientific evidence linked to them being at the crime scene. The men, who became known as the Cardiff Five, were unexpectedly arrested in response to local yacht club secretary Violet Perriam telling detectives she remembered seeing a number of suspicious black men near the flat where Lynette was killed. The five men were quickly accused of the murder, despite the police having previously said they were looking for a lone white male. In November 1990, after the longest murder trial in British history, three of them were found guilty and were sentenced to life imprisonment. The real murderer was Jeffrey Gafoor. In September 2000, an independent review into unsolved murders in south Wales paved the way for a fresh inquiry. Eight years later, South Wales Police reopened the case and discovered fresh forensic evidence at the scene, including specks of blood on the cellophane wrapper of a cigarette packet and on a skirting board, which had since been painted over. This started the hunt for a new suspect who was dubbed “The Cellophane Man''. After scientists looked into one of the rare DNA components, they narrowed down a list of people who had that component - with one result particularly sticking out. That partial match was with a youth who was not born when the 1988 killing took place, but who had had dealings with the police. But testing of the 14-year-old's family found a close relative whose DNA matched that of Cellophane Man's and he was instantly suspected as Lynette's murderer. That relative's name was Jeffery Gafoor - who had worked as a security guard at his family’s shop in nearby Roath at the time of Lynette’s death. In 2003, Gafoor was arrested by police - but in a bid to avoid justice the suspect attempted to commit suicide by taking an overdose of pills when he realised he was about to be apprehended. But, as police had Gafoor under surveillance, they prevented him from doing so and took him to hospital. It was on his way to get medical attention that he confessed to killing Lynette. Gafoor was sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court to life in prison for the 1988 murder.  The defendant had explained to the court, that on the last night of Lynette’s life, he had paid her for sex up front but changed his mind when he saw the state of her flat in Butestown, which had no electricity or running water. He then demanded back his £30 which she refused, before attacking her in fury. Prosecutor Patrick Harrington QC described the moment Gafoor confessed to the court: “He took a deep breath and said, just for the record, I did kill Lynette White.  ''I have been waiting for this for 15 years. Whatever happens to me, I deserve it.” He was ordered to serve a minimum of 13 years. Mr Justice John Royce who sentenced Gafoor said: “For 15 years, you kept your guilty secret and evaded justice even while others stood trial for the murder you knew that you had committed.” The notorious murderer has not been deemed suitable for release, according to the Parole Board. The coronavirus pandemic prevented Gafoor from making ""as much progress as hoped"", since he was transferred to an open prison in September 2020. While in prison, Gafoor has reportedly taken part in programmes to address his “decision-making, better ways of thinking and tendency to use violence”. In 2023, it was recommended that Gafoor could be allowed out on day release, but was not yet suitable to be allowed out on licence following a parole board review.

Ukraine war news latest — Wagner Group founder issues threat to Zelensky as UK slams Putin’s ‘inexperienced’ troops,"THE WAGNER Group founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has sent a direct threat to Volodymyr Zelensky as he wants to ""meet in the skies"".   The leader of the barbaric mercenary group has challenged the Ukrainian president to an aerial duel today. In a video clip from inside a military aircraft cockpit Yevgeny said: “Volodymyr Oleksandrovych [Zelensky], we have landed. “We have bombed Bakhmut. Tomorrow (today), I will fly a MiG-29. If you so desire, let’s meet in the skies. If you win, you take Artyomovsk [Bakhmut]. If not, we advance till [the River] Dnipro.” It comes as the UK's Ministry of Defence claimed Putin's ""inexperienced units"" are unlikely to ""substantially affect the outcome of the war within the coming weeks"".  Read our Ukraine war blog below for the latest news... The first Leopard 2 tank provided by Canada for Ukraine has arrived in Poland. The country’s minister of defence, Anita Anand, took to Twitter to share the news. She said: “The first Canadian Leopard 2 main battle tank that we’ve donated to Ukraine has now arrived in Poland. “Alongside our allies, we’ll soon be training the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the use of this equipment.” German prosecutor Peter Frank told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that his nation has collected evidence of war crimes in Ukraine – having begun doing so in March 2022. He said: “Currently, for example, we are focusing on the mass killings in Bucha or attacks against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure.” Mr Frank said that they have evidence in the “three-digit range” which was collected through a series of methods such as interviewing Ukrainian refugees and evaluating the information available to the public. No specific individual is being investigated by Germany yet. Norway has agreed to a £6billion aid package for Ukraine over the next five years. Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, confirmed the aid will go toward both military and humanitarian needs. Ukraine has called for an acceleration in military aid in recent months, as the country continues to repel Putin’s brutal invasion. Ukrainian troops, set to be trained in the operation of British tanks, arrived in the UK over the weekend. Britain is set to provide an entire squadron of tanks, as well as other vehicles, to Ukraine, as the country continues to repel Putin’s brutal invasion. Taking to Twitter, the British Ministry of Defence wrote: “A warm welcome to Ukrainian personnel who have arrived in the UK this weekend to get to grips with the AS90. “The AS90 is an armoured self-propelled artillery weapon which the UK is providing to help Ukraine defend its homeland and retake territory.” President Zelensky took to Twitter this morning to send his support to the people of Turkey. This comes after an earthquake hit the nation. Zelensky wrote: “Shocked by the news about the death and injury of hundreds of people as a result of the earthquake in Turkey. “I extend my condolences to the President Erdoğan , the people of Turkey and the families of those who lost their lives in the earthquake in Turkey and wish a speedy recovery to all the injured. “We stand with the people of Turkey in this difficult time. We are ready to provide the necessary assistance to overcome the consequences of the disaster.” Ukraine’s President Zelensky has once again called for Russia to be banned from the 2024 Paris Olympics. “Ukraine has sent appropriate letters to the companies that provide the biggest support for the International Olympic Committee,” the leader said in his nightly video address. Ukraine has slammed the Olympic Committee in recent weeks, claiming allowing Russia to compete would equal condoning “terrorism.” The British Ministry of Defence has shared its latest intel on the state of play in Ukraine. Russian and Ukrainian troops continue to clash in Bakhmut, as Putin desperately seeks to gain territory. This comes as Russian losses reportedly past 132,000 as we approach the one-year anniversary of Putin’s invasion. The illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is continuing.

Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, confirmed the aid will go toward both military and humanitarian needs. Ukraine has called for an acceleration in military aid in recent months, as the country continues to repel Putin’s brutal invasion. Ukraine’s President Zelensky has once again called for Russia to be banned from the 2024 Paris Olympics. “Ukraine has sent appropriate letters to the companies that provide the biggest support for the International Olympic Committee,” the leader said in his nightly video address. Ukraine has slammed the Olympic Committee in recent weeks, claiming allowing Russia to compete would equal condoning “terrorism.” A Ukrainian figure skater that performed in the Youth Olympic Games has been killed in the war.

Not one,” Reznikov said, reports the Kyiv Independent. “I will do what the head of state suggests to me.” President Zelensky have revoked Ukrainian citizenships of former politicians who had a dual Russian citizenship. The Ukrainian President said that he took this step “to protect and cleanse our state from those on the side of the aggressor.” Zelenskyy didn’t mentiony any names, however, Ukrainian state media RBC-Ukraine news agency is reporting that politicians include: The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, has sent a warning to the world during a speech at the the UN general assembly. He warned the world is walking into a ""wider war"" just weeks before the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  He said: ""The prospects for peace keep diminishing. The chances of further escalation and bloodshed keep growing.  ""I fear the world is not sleepwalking into a wider war. I fear it is doing so with its eyes wide open."" A once popular tourist destination, Bakhmut has been reduced to ruin. The area is hollowed out by artillery fire and levelled by carpet bombing - with it's frozen ground carved up by craters and trenches. A top Ukrainian official has said Western tank support will act as “iron fist” against Putin’s brutal invasion. “The new tank coalition with the main tanks of NATO countries – we need this for the counteroffensive, we will use it like an iron fist to break through their defensive lines,” Ukrainian defence minister Oleksii Reznikov said on Friday. Britain, Germany and France, among other Western powers, have pledged to send tanks to Ukraine. Colonel Andrus Merilo slammed the Russian army as ""corrupt"" and lacking ""the will"" to fight. The top soldier was speaking to our reporter embedded on Nato winter war games in Eastern Estonia as he said there is ""no alternative"" except for victory for Ukraine. Speaking to The Sun Online as his forces carried out intense trench warfare exercises, Colonel Merilo described the herculean effort by the Ukrainians against Putin as a ""miracle"". Russia is just a stone's throw away from the training ground, and the Estonian troops are constantly aware of the possible threat posed by an increasingly belligerent Putin. Speaking directly about Putin, Colonel Merilo simply described Vlad's war as a ""massive miscalculation"". ""It will be the end of his regime,"" he said. Wagner Group founder Yevgeny Prigozhin has sent a direct threat to Volodymyr Zelensky.  The Russian has challenged the Ukrainian president to an aerial duel.  In a video clip from inside a military aircraft cockpit he said: ""Volodymyr Oleksandrovych [Zelensky], we have landed. ""We have bombed Bakhmut. Tomorrow, I will fly a MiG-29. If you so desire, let's meet in the skies. If you win, you take Artyomovsk [Bakhmut]. If not, we advance till [the River] Dnipro."" President Zelensky is set to replace Ukraine's defence minister as the leader continues to crack down on so-called corruption within the ministry's ranks.  Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine's current minister of defence, is set to become the next high-ranking Ukrainian official to be replaced as a corruption scandal rocks the government department. Reznikov will now become the minister of strategic industries, said David Arakhamia, chief of Zelensky’s Servant of the People parliamentary bloc, on Sunday. This comes amid fears Putin could be set to launch a fresh offensive in the coming weeks, as fighting continues to rage on. Volodymyr Zelensky has sent his thanks to the Norwegian government for announcing a £6bn aid package.  He said: ""Grateful to the Norwegian people, government & personally @jonasgahrstore for announcing a new unprecedented 5-year assistance package to Ukraine for the sum of NOK 75 billion.

"Chinese spy balloon might have been rigged with explosives to self-destruct, says Pentagon","THE Chinese spy balloon might have been rigged with explosives to self-destruct, a top Pentagon official said yesterday. Air Force Gen Glen D. VanHerck, commander of the US Northern Command, also said it was 200-feet tall, weighed thousands of pounds and its payload was the size of a jetliner. President Joe Biden ordered the Air Force to shoot the balloon down off South Carolina on Saturday. The Air Force sent an F-22 fighter jet armed with an AIM-9X Sidewinder missile to do the job. The delay opened the president up to attacks from Republicans and was defended by National Security Council spokesman John Kirby. He said: “Because the president decided they wouldn’t shoot it down until he could do so safely, and that meant over water, that afforded us a terrific opportunity to gain a better understanding, to study the capabilities of this balloon.” He added: “So I can’t confirm whether it had explosives or not. ""Anytime you down something like this, we make an assumption that that potential exists.” VanHerck said the majority of the debris had been collected, but there was a possibility some could come ashore. He warned people to call the authorities and stay away from it. Weather conditions had yet to allow undersea recovery efforts to fully begin, Kirby said.

"Turkey earthquake death toll could hit TWENTY THOUSAND after twin mega quakes flatten cities, WHO fears","MORE than 20,000 people could be dead after two ""once-in-a-century"" earthquakes rocked Turkey and Syria, the World Health Organisation has warned. A massive 7.8 magnitude shock - one of the biggest for 100 years - was followed hours later by another huge 7.5 magnitude quake, devastating at least 12 cities. Frantic survivors used their bare hands to dig through the rubble of flattened homes and were filmed pulling children to safety amid scenes of utter destruction. The twin earthquakes also sparked tsunami alerts on Mediterranean coasts in Greece, Cyprus and Italy, and shaking was felt as far away as Egypt and Iran. By night time the confirmed death toll was over 3,700 - but the WHO has warned the total could rocket to more than 20,000 as rescuers find more victims in the rubble. Catherine Smallwood, WHO senior emergency officer for Europe, said: ""We always see the same thing with earthquakes, unfortunately, which is that the initial reports of the numbers of people who have died or who have been injured will increase quite significantly in the week that follows.” Most victims were asleep when the initial mega quake hit at 4am local time. The 7.8 shock was the biggest in Turkey for ""hundreds of years"", geophysics professor Martin Mai told the BBC. It struck near Gaziantep in eastern Turkey at a depth of around 15 miles. The powerful quake was followed by dozens of powerful aftershocks which toppled already damaged buildings in great heaps of dust. Then just before 1.30pm a second massive quake of magnitude 7.5 sent terrified locals running into the streets. Videos showed buildings collapsing as rescue workers fled for their lives amid dust and chaos.  The second quake - which was just six miles deep with an epicentre 59 miles north of the first - would itself have been the region's most powerful since 1999. An official from Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority said it was ""not an aftershock"" and was ""independent"" from the earlier quake. Earthquake experts said it lay on a separate fault line but would almost certainly have been triggered by the initial shock. Northern Syria was also devastated by the double shocks which caused buildings to violently shake side-to-side. It is expected to be one of the worst-ever disasters in a region that is susceptible to catastrophic earthquakes. “Turkey has experienced the deadliest earthquake worldwide four times in the last 50 years so is no stranger to the deadly consequences of such events,” said UCL professor Joanna Faure Walker. So far at least 2,316 people are confirmed dead in Turkey, said the country's Disaster and Emergency Management Agency. Another 13,000 people were injured and 5,600 buildings were destroyed, authorities added. At least 1,444 people were killed in Syria and about 3,500 injured, according to figures from the Damascus government and organisations in opposition-held areas. Survivors of the destruction face freezing conditions and potential disease. He told CNN: ""This population was already highly vulnerable. They have a huge amount of people who have already been displaced — sometimes as many as 20 times. ""Almost the majority of them are women and children, particularly vulnerable to the harsh weather and this earthquake.”  Horror pictures from earlier showed the devastation after tower blocks collapsed - crushing and trapping people inside at 4am local time. Striking just before dawn, the epicentre was near the town of Nurdagi, Turkey.  The ground began to shake as many people were still asleep in their beds and unable to flee.  Melisa Salman, of Kahramanmaras, said living in an earthquake zone meant she was used to ""being shaken"". But she told the BBC: ""It's the first time we have ever experienced anything like that. ""We thought it was the apocalypse."" More than 120 aftershocks followed along a 200-mile fault line including three of greater than 6.0 magnitude.  And elsewhere, a massive column of fire was seen as a gas pipeline ruptured.  Footage shared on social media reportedly shows the scene in Kahramanmara as flames lit up the night sky. Gas flows were suspended in the city and into Hatay and Kahramanmaraş after the explosion, according to BOTAS. Buildings were reported collapsed across a 200-mile swathe of cities from Diyarbakir in Turkey to Aleppo and Hama in Syria. Some of the heaviest devastation occurred near the quake's epicentre between Kahramanmaras and Gaziantep, where entire city blocks lay in ruins under the gathering snow. Gaziantep Castle, which was built more than 2,200 years ago, collapsed during the earthquake. As dawn broke desperate rescue operations were underway in a bid to free those trapped under the rubble.  Video showed the moment one family was pulled alive from the wreckage of their home Turkey and a young boy being rescued in Syria. In Syria, buildings already damaged by years of civil war collapsed in areas that are home to millions of refugees. In Turkey, shocked survivors rushed out into the snow-covered streets in their pyjamas, watching rescuers dig through the debris of damaged homes. ""Seven members of my family are under the debris,"" Muhittin Orakci, a stunned survivor in Turkey's mostly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir, told AFP. ""My sister and her three children are there. And also her husband, her father-in-law and her mother-in-law."" The rescue was being hampered by a winter blizzard that covered major roads in ice and snow. The quake made three major airports in the area inoperable, further complicating deliveries of vital aid. Kahramanmaras Governor Omer Faruk Coskun said: ""It is not possible to give the number of dead and injured at the moment because so many buildings have been destroyed."" Images on Turkish television showed rescuers digging through rubble across city centres and residential neighbourhoods of almost all the big cities running along the border with Syria. A famous mosque dating back to the 13th century partially collapsed in the province of Maltaya, where a 14-floor building with 28 apartments also collapsed. In other cities, anguished rescuers struggled to reach survivors trapped under the debris. ""We hear voices here -- and over there, too,"" one rescuer was overheard as saying on NTV television in front of a flattened building in the city of Diyarbakir. ""There may be 200 people under the rubble."" Turkey declared a state of emergency with 15,000 rescue personnel responding to the disaster. Offers of help flooded in from around the world. Nations began sending rescuers and equipment within hours. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak tweeted: ""My thoughts are with the people of Türkiye and Syria this morning, particularly with those first responders working so valiantly to save those trapped by the earthquake.  ""The UK stands ready to help in whatever way we can."" US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Washington was ""profoundly concerned"". ""We stand ready to provide any and all needed assistance,"" Sullivan said. Additional offers of help poured in from the European Union, Russia, Italy and Turkey's historic rival Greece, whose relations with Ankara have suffered from a spate of border and cultural disputes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also offered to provide ""the necessary assistance"" to Turkey, whose combat drones are helping Kyiv fight the Russian invasion. The quake was also felt in Lebanon and Syria and even as far as Cyprus and Cairo. Lebanese were shaken from their sleep with many driving away from buildings as they swayed.  ""I was writing something and just all of a sudden the entire building started shaking and yes I didn't really know what to feel,"" Mohamad El Chamaa, a student in the Lebanese capital Beirut, told the BBC. ""I was right next to the window so I was just scared that they might shatter.  ""It went on for four to five minutes and it was pretty horrific. It was mind-blowing."" In Turkey, people trying to leave the quake-stricken regions caused traffic jams, hampering efforts of emergency teams trying to reach the affected areas. The country frequestly has warthquakes since it sits on top of major fault lines. In 1999, more than 17,000 people were killed after a powerful tremor rocked the north-west of Turkey. Turkey’s worst earthquake disaster was in 1939 when 33,000 people died in the eastern Erzincan province. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21286354/turkey-lebanon-earthquake-aftershock/

TikTok star Gabriel Netto famous for pranks on mum drowns after diving into reservoir at party with friends and family,"A TIKTOK star famed for playing pranks on his mum has drowned after diving into a reservoir. Gabriel Netto, 20, was at a party with family and friends in Juiz de Fora, Brazil, when it is understood he became unconscious while swimming in the water. His pals managed to pull him from the reservoir following a frantic 40-minute search but he was unresponsive. But paramedics were unable to revive him and he was pronounced dead at the scene on Friday. It is unclear what caused Gabriel to pass out in the water. His sister Aline described him as her ""friend, adviser and companion"" in a touching tribute. She said: ""Today, I didn't just lose a brother, I lost a part of my soul. ""A big part of me has gone with you, I was with you until the last minute of your life.  ""I am forever grateful for our union. You were and always will be our Gabriel.

World’s shark attack hotspot revealed – do you go on holiday there?,"FLORIDA is the world’s shark attack hotspot, researchers revealed. The Sunshine State had more reported bites than anywhere else in 2022. None of the 16 attacks on people were fatal but two — likely from bull sharks — resulted in amputations. The number worldwide equalled a ten-year low, according to the University of Florida’s International Shark Attack File. There were a total of 57 unprovoked bites, mostly in the US and Australia. Five were fatal, down from nine deaths in 2021 and ten the year before. Experts say the drop may reflect a global decline in shark numbers. And Dr Gavin Naylor, head of shark research at the Florida Museum of Natural History, added: ""Generally speaking, the number of sharks in the world's oceans has decreased, which may have contributed to recent lulls. ""It's likely that fatalities are down because some areas have recently implemented rigorous beach safety protocols, especially in Australia."" Dr Naylor added: ""Juveniles tend to be more experimental and will try things that an adult shark wouldn't. ""If fish are especially dense where people are swimming and visibility is poor, then it is more likely that young sharks, which lack the experience of older animals, will mistake a swimmer's foot for their intended prey.""

Author Salman Rushdie shares health update in first interview since being repeatedly stabbed,"SIR Salman Rushdie has expressed his gratitude to medics in his first interview since he was repeatedly stabbed.

Sir Salman said: “I’m lucky. What I really want to say is my main overwhelming feeling is gratitude. “At some point, I’d like to go back up there and say thank you.” He also thanked his sons and wife who “had the emotional burden of my almost being killed”. In an interview with The New Yorker magazine, he said that he is “not so bad” and that “all the big injuries are healed, essentially”. But he struggles to type due to hand injuries. And the author of The Satanic Verses — his 1988 novel that led to death threats from Muslims who consider it blasphemous — said: “There is such a thing as PTSD.

Inside world’s loneliest McDonald’s abandoned on Netflix Pirate Gold island with old menu & jaw-dropping 1990s prices,"ABANDONED for over 30 years, this McDonald’s is located on the same island of Netflix’s series Pirate Gold Of Adak Island. The restaurant, which eerily stands on a deserted Alaskan naval base, appears to have been untouched since the 1990’s. It has since received social media recognition following the popular 2022 Netflix show, with one Reddit user saying: “This also brought up memories of Pirate Gold Of Adak Island on Netflix. Find any gold nuggets while there?” Pirate Gold is a reality TV series about an expert team who are on the hunt to unearth legendary pirate treasure amid the harsh Alaskan wilderness. There is currently one season with eight episodes available on Netflix at the moment, with the show only holding a 4.7/10 IMDb rating. The abandoned fast-food joint has been trending on social media after the show's release however, with some TikToks of people exploring the restaurant racking up over 100k views. Initially, the McDonalds garnered attention when a Twitter user pointed out the location and posted pictures of the drive-thru area, upturned tables and a menu with a $1 cheeseburger in 2021. The viral photo was captioned: “Abandoned McDonald’s on the remote Alaskan island still has the menu up with Bobby’s World and Jurassic Park promos.” Many Twitter users were left in shock at the photos of the eaterie. One tweeted: “This needs to be in a museum… or my basement.” Another said: “This  is a post-apocalyptic television series I need NOW.” One user pointed out: “The prices haven’t changed much.” The National Park Service said that Adak was originally set as an outpost for Army and Navy bases during World War II.  More than 6,000 military and civilians lived on Adak during its peak in the 1980s, so an enterprising couple opened the restaurant in July 1986 with assistance from the Navy. Many of the town’s residents fled the area and businesses closed when the naval base was abandoned in the 1990s, the Los Angeles Times said. The former store owner's son even created a Twitter account in 2021 to share information on the abandoned building after the island and its 33 permanent residents became a social media curiosity overnight. Social media users were losing their minds at the 1990 food prices and reminisced about the old school Jurassic Park posters and Bobby’s World toys.  One Reddit user recently commented under a resurfaced photo of the McDonalds: “Saw this posted just last night in another sub and replied to someone else’s comment about nostalgia. I love seeing this image pop into my feed every few months, it reminds me of simpler times. Thank you”  Another joked: “$1.10 for Florida Orange Juice. Ahh the good old days”.

I’m a real-life gold digger – I love the thrill of the chase in 40C & found one nugget that fetched a jaw-dropping price,"BEING a good gold digger is typically not a favourable reputation to have - unless you're a real-life prospector.  Luckily for Tyler Mahoney, she's a dab hand at detecting treasures while mining in the town of Kalgoorlie in Australia. The 25-year-old admits she is addicted to the thrill of noticing a golden nugget - even when she's working in up to 40C heat. The gruelling 10-hour shifts in scorching temperatures do little to dampen Tyler's spirit, as she knows she could stumble across a small fortune any second.  But she confessed the kick comes at the cost of financial insecurity, saying: ""It’s either baked beans or lobster in the gold world. ""I think I love chasing the highs of finding gold, and that lure of finding a big nugget always keeps me coming back,"" Tyler told 7News.  ""It’s like a carrot being dangled in front of you every day at work - tomorrow could always be the day you could find that million-dollar nugget. ""Every time you do find gold, it’s like a little dopamine hit and I think that is a big part of gold fever."" The fourth-generation prospector followed in her family's footsteps after growing up in a secluded mining town.  She has ""buried for gold ever since she can remember"" and now works full-time hunting for treasures on land leased by her parents.  The mining lease grants the holder exclusive rights to mine for minerals over a specific area of the grounds.  Joining the family trade has paid off for Tyler, as she explained her mum once found a nugget that fetched a jaw-dropping price.  The 311.8g treasure, found just outside her hometown, was worth a whopping £51, 320.  Tyler recalled: ""My mum found that just close to Kalgoorlie on some of our tenements and it’s a great piece."" The gold digger explained she loves being her own boss in the male-dominated industry and wants more women to consider mining as a career.  The prospector claims a lot of people find it hard to believe her extraordinary job.  ""A look of confusion wipes over their faces normally,"" Tyler said. ""I definitely do not look like the normal prospector but I love sharing my job and breaking those stereotypes."" Yet she also warned the grind isn't as glamorous as the reward - as she has to work in all seasons for exhaustingly long hours.  Tyler added: ""We work in all kinds of conditions. Prospecting the outback of Western Australia brings really hot and dry summers which make working quite difficult. ""I have also prospected all around the world including the hot humid jungle, the high altitude of the Andes and the freezing cold and dark Alaska. ""If gold was in the easiest of places, everyone would be finding it."" She recently returned back Down Under after taking a brief hiatus to work as a mine manager in Alaska. However, her heart firmly belongs in Australia - hunting for nuggets of gold in her hometown while championing her heritage.  Tyler added: ""My parents have taken us out on prospecting trips to hunt for buried gold ever since I can remember. ""I also love the outback and being in the bush, being so remote with no one around you for hundreds of miles.""

"Ukraine war will be the END of Vladimir Putin’s regime, says Estonian colonel training 80 miles from border with Russia","VLADIMIR Putin's invasion of Ukraine will be the end of his tyrannical regime, an Estonian colonel training just 80 miles from the border with Russia has insisted.  Colonel Andrus Merilo slammed the Russian army as ""corrupt"" and lacking ""the will"" to fight.  The top soldier was speaking to our reporter embedded on Nato winter war games in Eastern Estonia as he said there is ""no alternative"" except for victory for Ukraine.  The icy exercises are an annual drill - but have taken on a chilling new importance since Putin attacked Ukraine almost a year ago on February 24. And with the spectre of the conflict hanging over them, the soldiers from Britain, Estonia, France, the US and Denmark are all united and dutifully carrying out their drills.  Speaking to The Sun Online as his forces carried out intense trench warfare exercises, Colonel Merilo described the herculean effort by the Ukrainians against Putin as a ""small miracle"".  Russia is just a stone's throw away from the training ground, and the Estonian troops are constantly aware of the possible threat posed by an increasingly belligerent Putin. Speaking directly about Putin, Colonel Merilo simply described Vlad's war as a ""massive miscalculation"".  ""It will be the end of his regime,"" he said. The colonel, from the 1st Estonian Infantry Brigade, said his forces have been learning from observing the Russians in Ukraine.  He slammed Putin's forces performance - and praised the valour of the Ukrainians.  Cradling his R20 Rahe assault rifle, Colonel Merilo explained: ""I didn't expect the Russians to conduct the war so poorly.  ""Fortunately for us, there is too much corruption in the Russian army, and a lot of money has been stolen.  ""Ukraine has been successfully fighting Russia for one year, but now is the time they desperately need more support and weapons systems."" He added: ""The Ukrainians are much better soldiers than the Russians.  ""They have a much stronger will to fight, they are defending their country and their families.  ""The Russians don't have this will. It is a small miracle what the Ukrainians are doing."" But he was clear the next two months will be decisive.  It is a small miracle what the Ukrainians are doing ""Ukraine has to win this war, there is no alternative, or any NATO nation is at risk. ""It is now very clear that Russia is a threat to its neighbours,"" the soldier added.  ""What we need is more readiness and communication towards the Russians that Nato is more than capable of holding them off."" Colonel Merilo said Estonia has been aware of a possible attack by Russia since they first gained independence in 1991.  And he said they are ready for ""any incursion"" from the East.  He went on: ""We have predicted Russia would invade Ukraine for some time. ""Nato forces are extremely capable. In terms of technical ability, we are very superior to Russia."" The forces are carrying out exercises called Winter Camp 23 as they drill to work on the readiness of Nato's Forward Presence Battlegroup.  Temperatures in Keskpolügoon, or the Central Training Area, are expected to drop to around -12C as they carry out the war games this week.  On the vast military base - about the size of 15,000 football pitches - the troops from all nations are being put through their paces.  The war continues to rumble on in Ukraine, with fears of a possible new Russian offensive being launched to mark the first anniversary of the invasion.  But this is not weighing on Colonel Merilo's mind - he is focusing on making sure his men are in top shape as they work alongside their allies.  He said: ""We don't care about those kind of anniversaries. ""We are learning from the experiences in Ukraine, but we are improving our ability to operate in such snowy conditions."" The colonel went on: ""Estonian Defence is based on the understanding if we go to war, we go to war as a nation.  ""We cannot afford to put together a huge army.  ""If needed without any notice, we can put together an army of more than 26,000 troops to defend Estonia."" Nato nations have been providing Ukraine with weapons and armour to defend their country against the Russians. But many in Kyiv fear it is not enough - especially with reports as many as 500,000 Russian soldiers could be preparing for a spring offensive.  President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned the war is going to get more challenging - and has continues to urge the West to help him arm his troops. Putin has managed to turn Russia into a pariah state since the start of the war - with his list of allies dwindling. And his future is believed to be tied to the war's success or failure. Putin has been warned he could face an internal uprising unless he manages to achieve something in Ukraine. He had foolishly expected to steamroller Ukraine and for his soldiers to be welcomed as ""liberators"" - but they have faced a fierce fightback. Cities initially seized by the Russians were then retaken by the Ukrainians.  But after a near stalemate over the winter, it is believed Vlad may be preparing a hammer blow to try to win the war and save his own skin.  The fiercest of the fighting is currently focused on the city of Bakhmut. It is devolving into the bloodiest battle of the war so far with a life expectancy of soldiers on the frontline reportedly being just being just four hours.  With the first anniversary of the war fast approaching, the next few months could make or break both the conflict and the future of the international order on the world's stage.

Inside bid to salvage £16million worth of gold from 170-year-old shipwreck as eerie pics show vessel 180ft underwater,"SHIPWRECK hunters are hoping to salvage £16million worth of gold from a vessel that was lost in a storm more than 150 years ago. The rusting remains of The Westmoreland - packed with a cache of rare 19th-century whiskey and gold coins - went undiscovered for more than a century.  It sank to the depths of Lake Michigan on December 17, 1854, tragically taking 17 souls down along with it.  The location of the shipwreck, 180ft beneath the waters of Platte Bay, was only discovered in 2010 after 156 years.  Despite being brimming with treasures, it's forbidden to recover artefacts from Great Lakes wrecks without a permit. But talks are now underway to salvage the spoils from the Westmoreland, according to shipwreck hunter Ross Richardson. After incredibly tracking down the vessel, he has been desperate to dive inside the ""underwater museum."" The wreckage expert said the Westmoreland is loaded with ""perfectly-preserved relics"" with historical and monetary value. Ross explained: ""We are in the beginning stages of discussing a salvage operation to recover the whiskey casks and possibly other artefacts. ""The Westmoreland is an underwater museum, filled with perfectly-preserved relics from the 1850s, and preserving them for public display would be a worthy cause. ""She is one of the most intact and best-preserved shipwrecks from the 1850s on the planet."" He hinted that a regional distillery was ""extremely interested"" in salvaging the precious whiskey barrels for tasting and selling. ""The genetic makeup of corn was much different in 1854 and may have had a different taste to today's corn,"" Ross added. Eerie underwater images of the shipwreck, snapped by diver Chris Roxburgh, depict the decaying Westmoreland sitting upright on the bottom of the water.  She is instantly recognisable from the iconic ""hogging arches"" running along both sides of the ship.  The spooky snaps show the vessel is largely intact despite being a prisoner to the seabed in the icy water for over 150 years.  Ross said he was only able to locate the wreck after ""about a decade's worth of research"" and arming himself with the latest sonar technology. He said: ""The area where the Westmoreland sank was not flat and smooth, like the majority of Lake Michigan's bottom. ""It was full of underwater sand dunes and cliffs, making early search efforts very difficult. ""Around 2008, there was a breakthrough in side scan sonar technology, and an affordable and capable sonar unit was made available to the public. ""I was an early adopter of this technology and it's perfect for searching the area where the Westmoreland sank. ""Many searchers were in the right area, but lacked the right tools for the job."" The Westmoreland was bound for Mackinac Island before she sadly sank - carrying some 280 barrels of whiskey to supply soldiers along with winter supplies.  Ross said: ""It made life very hard for the army when she did not arrive."" The ship's crew were en route to a fort that watched over the meeting point of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan. It is thought that the hoard of gold coins could have been the troop's pay packet - which could now be worth up to £16million. Ross suspects the double eagle pieces would prove a hit with coin collectors and could fetch a fortune at auction.  He continued: ""The gold coins would be worth about a million dollars if we melted them down and sold them. ""The true value is the numismatic value of these coins, which could realistically be more than $20million today."" The salvage operation would be focused on retrieving the whiskey - but it will be no easy feat.  The challenging location of the shipwreck has left hunters scratching their heads as they struggle to determine the best route inside.  Ross said: ""It's a difficult dive since there is no rope or buoy attached to the ship and it's almost 200ft deep. ""The water temp was freezing cold at 34F (1C). The gold and whiskey is deeper in the wreck, in the hold or cabins. ""And the deck is partially collapsed, so getting deeper into vessel is hard."" But he still holds out hope that the Westmoreland's treasures will one day see the surface again.  The shipwreck enthusiast added: ""Eventually, yes. But, we are a long way, maybe decades, from making that happen. ""Only time will tell if the Westmoreland will share her secrets with us."" Although the vessel's battle with the storm claimed 17 souls, the same number of people survived the incident.  Those that made it ashore reportedly faced a walk of some 40 miles to the nearest town. Ross details his quest to find the wreck in his book, The Search for the Westmoreland. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21289181/bid-to-salvage-16million-gold-from-shipwreck/
Mum and 7 kids killed in house fire ‘sparked by faulty tumble dryer turned on at night when electricity was cheaper’,"A MOTHER and her seven children horrifically died in a house fire after a faulty tumble dryer ignited during the night, investigators believe. The family were killed in the blaze that erupted shortly after midnight at their townhouse in Charly-sur-Marne, 50 miles east of Paris. Nearly 80 firefighters battled to douse the blaze as the mum and her kids were trapped on the upper floor.  Rescuers are said to have struggled to get their ladders to reach the top windows of the home on the narrow street. Fire chief Jean-Claude Ouguel said: ""The house was completely destroyed. Only the side walls remain."" The sole survivor of the tragic incident is the woman's husband and father of three of the children, who suffered severe burns. Police fear he unknowingly sealed the brood's fate by telling them to stay upstairs while he went to investigate the smoke. The property's electric window shutters were also blocked due to a power outage, leaving them with no way to escape from the fumes. The children - five girls and two boys aged between two and 14 - died from asphyxiation, local prosecutor Julien Morino-Ros said.  He revealed that the deadly fire appeared to have been caused by a faulty tumble dryer situated on the ground floor. There was no initial information about the type of tumble dryer involved, or its manufacturer or service history. It is thought that the family may have put the appliance on in the early hours of the morning, when electricity costs are cheaper. Mr Morino-Ros confirmed that – in line with judicial procedure in such cases – a criminal enquiry had been opened for manslaughter. Sylvie Corré, the wife of the owner of the rented property, said of the tragedy: ""I hope with all my heart that those who died did not feel any pain, or see anything.  ""We were there in the street all night and watched the horror."" She explained that the father worked for her family's champagne firm, describing him as an ""excellent employee."" Slyvi said the couple were in their 40s and – along with their children – were very popular in the area. The father spent a night in hospital, and his condition later on Monday was described as ""stable and not life-threatening."" The official cause of the fire has not yet been determined, however, the French Public Prosecution Service has launched an investigation.  The fatal inferno, which also damaged neighbouring properties, was eventually extinguished after several hours.

Boeing 737 crashes in Australian national park as firefighting plane plunges to the ground,"A FIREFIGHTING plane has horrifically crashed while trying to douse raging bushfires on the south coast of Western Australia.  Two people on board the Boeing 737-3 aircraft were injured after it smashed into the Fitzgerald River National Park. They had taken off from the Busselton-Margaret River Regional Airport to help extinguish two ferocious blazes at 3.30pm.  The Coulson aviation water bomber then suddenly crashed as it approached the scene.  The aircraft is said to have fallen into the forest situated between the towns of Ravensthorpe and Hopetoun.  Both pilots miraculously escaped without serious injury and were rescued from the crash site by helicopter.  The pair were then airlifted to Ravensthorpe to receive medical treatment for minor injuries, police said.  The Royal Flying Doctor Service has mobilised a team to rush the crew to Perth for further treatment if required. It is not yet clear what caused the dramatic crash.  The crew were due to help aid efforts to bring two ferocious bushfires under control as they ripped through the national park. The dual inferno has reportedly already incinerated over 2,220 acres of the rural landscape after beginning at 10am.  The Fitzgerald River National Park is home to 75 rare plant species that do not grow anywhere else in the world. Around 30 Parks and Wildlife Service firefighters are trying to bring the fires under control. A bushfire watch and act alert is in place for local residents amid concerns the flames pose a risk to lives and property.  Officers from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau are set to attend the crash site to begin investigations when safe to do so. The arrival of the Boeing 737-3, nicknamed 'Phoenix', in Western Australia was announced back in December.  The impressive plane, used by the US to tackle the Californian wildfires, was added to the roster in preparation for fire season. But by the time the news had been revealed, the water bomber had already been put to work to douse fires near Cervantes and Jurien Bay.  The plane boasts the capacity to carry 15,000 litres of fire suppressants and has a loaded cruising speed of nearly 800 kilometres an hour.

You have the eyes of a hawk if you can spot the snake lurking in this kitchen in less than five seconds,"A SNAKE is lurking in this seemingly innocent kitchen... Can you spot it? Puzzled social media users have been challenged by Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers 24/7 to find the hidden reptile in this kitchen photo. Facebook users were left baffled while attempting to locate the camouflaged serpent. The photo shows two wooden kitchen stools pushed close together with some magazines placed on top. One user, Melissa Neuendorf, joked: “The newest edition of Where’s Wally I can never find the snake.” Another added: “I’m doomed, doomed I tell you! In a picture of two chairs I do not see a snake.” “It’s called spot the snake so I can’t say it’s teeny tiny hiding under the papers. “So unless it’s camouflaged itself to look like a magazine I see nothing, nothing at all…for the love.” Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers also teased there would be “extra points” for snake-savvy users who can guess the species. The tiny serpent had sneakily curled itself around the back leg of the right-hand stool. Some sharp-eyed users even had a stab at guessing the species. One wrote: “Too hard to get a look to figure out the species, but gotta be a scrub python at that size right???” Snake catcher Lockie Gilding, who attended the removal in Ninderry, Queensland, said the reptile was a brown tree snake. Gilding also stated that the cheeky snake was a hatchling, less than a year old. Although brown tree snakes are slightly venomous, they are not considered to be dangerous to people who may encounter them. Despite this, one user was still freaked out at the sighting, commenting: “even though it’s small I’d leave it well alone - some of those small snakes are as toxic as those bigger ones”. This comes after snake-catching company Snake Catchers Brisbane & Gold Coast posted their own snaps to Facebook on Friday, challenging users to spot a deadly snake in a swimming pool. An optical illusion was also shared on TikTok last week that claimed only 1% of people could spot the reptile hiding in a tree.

Turkey earthquake sparks 100ft inferno with burst gas pipe sending flames shooting into the sky as hundreds are killed,"A MASSIVE explosion has reportedly ripped through a major gas pipeline as Turkey battles the devastation from a huge 7.8 magnitude earthquake.  Turkey's state-owned energy company BOTAS confirmed natural gas flows have been suspended in the fallout from the huge tremor that has killed more than 1,000 people. Terrifying footage widely shared on social media reportedly shows the horrifying scene of the massive pipeline rupture.  Flames can be rising into the sky, lighting up the darkness after the quake which struck at around 4am before dawn. The ominous glow illuminated the smoke-filled airspace as two sections of the pipeline, around three kilometres from each other, were ablaze. Estimates say the tower of flame was around 100ft high.  Multiple videos appear to show the same incident in Kahramanmaraş, reports Rudaw.  Gas flows have been suspended in the region after the explosion, according to BOTAS. Oil pipelines going through Turkey are reported to have not been affected by the quake.  BOTAS is working to carry out inspections on all damaged gas infrastructure.  ""Necessary works are being done in coordination with natural gas distribution companies in the region so that the flow of gas can be done safely for our citizens,"" the firm said. It comes as the nation was rocked by a second massive earthquake and repeated aftershocks as search and rescue efforts got underway. It was hit by a quake almost as big as the first, registering at 7.5 and a depth of just five miles. Experts had already warned the death toll - which is already at more than 1,000 - could hit as high as 10,000. The enormous tremor- the biggest to hit the country in 100 years - also caused devastation in neighbouring Syria. The record-setting tremor was felt on the island of Cyprus and as far away as Egypt and. A second tremor of 7.8 also struck just hours later as rescue workers desperately searched for survivors in the rubble.  Striking just before dawn, the epicenter was near the town of Nurdagi, Turkey.  The ground began to shake as many people were still unsleep in their beds and unable to flee.  Up to 78 aftershocks followed that stretched to daylight hours with the strongest measuring 6.6.  Harrowing images showed collapsed buildings in multiple cities and many hundreds have been injured. Buildings were reported collapsed across a 200 mile swath of cities from Diyarbakir in Turkey to Aleppo and Hama in Syria. Some of the heaviest devastation occurred near the quake's epicentre between Kahramanmaras and Gaziantep, where entire city blocks lay in ruins under the gathering snow. Gaziantep Castle, which was built more than 2,200 years ago, collapsed during the earthquake. As dawn broke desperate rescue operations were underway in a bid to free those trapped under the rubble.  Turkey has declared a state of emergency and help is being pledged from around the world. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will be under intense pressure to oversee an effective response to the disaster heading to a tightly-contested May 14 election. ""We hope that we will get through this disaster together as soon as possible and with the least damage,"" the Turkish leader tweeted. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak tweeted; ""My thoughts are with the people of Türkiye and Syria this morning, particularly with those first responders working so valiantly to save those trapped by the earthquake.  ""The UK stands ready to help in whatever way we can."" US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Washington was ""profoundly concerned"". ""We stand ready to provide any and all needed assistance,"" Sullivan said. Additional offers of help poured in from the European Union, Russia, Italy and Turkey's historic rival Greece, whose relations with Ankara have suffered from a spate of border and cultural disputes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also offered to provide ""the necessary assistance"" to Turkey, whose combat drones are helping Kyiv fight the Russian invasion.

"Andrew Tate strangled me until I passed out during violent sex after luring me to Romania, says Brit ex-cam girl","A WOMAN who worked as a web cam girl for Andrew Tate has alleged he strangled her during violent sex until she passed out. The 36-year-old misogynist influencer and his brother Tristan, 34, are currently in jail in Romania after being accused of sex trafficking and rape. The Tate brothers have been in custody since late December and deny all allegations against them. The woman, who’s now helping the prosecution, told the BBC she was approached “completely out of the blue” on Facebook. Tate said he wanted her to be his girlfriend and persuaded her to visit him in Romania then to work as a webcam girl. But she said Tate became increasingly controlling, fining her if out without his permission and he then became violent. The woman -  who was given the pseudonym Sophie by the BBC - explained that “most of the violence was sexual, that's obviously something that he's into” and “used to strangle me, to the point where I passed out”. “He likes to feel completely in control of the woman and feel like he could take their life away at any second. That is a big sexual turn on for him.” Sophie also claims that at one point “he held me up against the wall and he slapped me really hard and followed it with 'you whore'.” Her allegations come as Tate was accused of violently abusing two women while running a webcam business in the UK. Sophie says that eventually, she managed to leave the relationship with “narcissist” Tate, who she also describes as “very manipulative” and lacking in “any kind of empathy”. ""I just had to get away from it. I remember being at work and I was just so overwhelmed and I'd never felt a darkness like it."" Mateea Petrescu, who handles media requests for the Tate brothers, told the BBC they would not comment on the claims. It is alleged the Tates and their two enforcers - also known as their ""angels"" - would exploit the women, taking half of their earnings as they carried out sex work on OnlyFans. Andrew is claimed to have lured an unnamed woman, from Moldova, to join him in Romania - assuring her ""nothing bad would happen"". He is then alleged to have raped her twice, according to prosecutors, as she joined his operation. A court last week rejected a bid by the pair to be released on bail meaning they will stay in jail until at least February 27. The Tates have now hired as their lawyer Tina Glandian, who has represented disgraced stars Chris Brown, Mike Tyson and Jussie Smollett.

Putin mercenary who kept ‘skull of a dead Ukrainian’ as prize is shot in the head by assassin in latest targeted attack,"A PUTIN mercenary who kept a ""skull of a dead Ukrainian soldier"" as a prize has been gunned down in a targeted attack. Igor Mangushev was shot in the head and rushed to a hospital in Donetsk, Ukraine, where he is reportedly in a ""grave"" condition. The hit on the sick Russian propagandist happened in the early hours of Saturday, January 4. Analysts claim the assassination attempt may be a warning to the leader of Russia’s mercenary Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin. Mangushev, 36, was one of Russia’s most notable TV spin doctors before he enlisted in Putin's army using the call name, Bereg. Shocking pictures on social media showed Mangushev lying bloodied on a hospital bed connected to life support equipment. His friend Boris Rozhkin shared the image, who described his condition as ""grave"". According to The Daily Telegraph, doctors concluded he was shot from a handgun at close range. No further details of the attack have been confirmed. However, Russia expert Mark Galeotti believed Mangushev had significant ties to the Wagner group and that it could have been a proxy attack. Galeotti said: ""I think we can safely describe this as a hit. ""This could be a warning or taking a pawn off the board. ""Or it is a sign that Mr Prigozhin’s more thuggish rivals feel he is weakened enough that they can move."" In August 2022, Mangushev disgraced himself publicly brandishing the skull of a ""dead Ukrainian fighter"" during a stage show. The skull supposedly belonged to a slain fighter killed near the Azovstal steel plant in Ukraine.  During a speech, deranged Mangushev held up the skull and said: ""We’re alive and this guy is already dead. ""Let him burn in hell. He wasn’t lucky. We’ll make a goblet out of his skull."" He ranted: ""Why can’t there be any reconciliation?  ""Ukraine must be de-Ukrainised. The Russian lands of Novorossiya must be returned back.  ""We are not at war with people of blood and flesh. We are at war with an idea — Ukraine as an anti-Russian state. ""This is the tragedy of Ukrainian soldiers. We don’t care how many we have to kill. ""If we were at war with people we could make peace with them."" Mangushev is supposedly fighting against Ukraine but he is also the head of nationalist movement Light Russia and a creator of a private army ENOT, which is said to have links to the FSB. The chilling performance with the human skull violates the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation and is a war crime in international law. On his Telegram channel, the twisted Russian has also openly called for the killing of civilians. His post read: ""We will burn your houses, kill your families, take away your children and raise them Russians.""

Inside Ukraine’s bloodiest battle where soldiers have just 4 HOUR life expectancy in fighting with ‘drugged up’ Russians,"UKRAINIAN troops in the battle for Bakhmut are fighting against what they’ve alleged is a drugged up, zombie-like army that often outnumbers them ten to one.  The current battle cry echoing across Ukraine is “Bakhmut holds” as their soldiers withstand the full might of the Russian military on their frozen eastern frontline. A once popular tourist destination, Bakhmut has largely been reduced to ruin.  The city's been hollowed out by artillery fire and levelled by carpet bombing - with its frozen ground carved up by craters and trenches. Its pre-war population of 80,000 has dwindled to around 7,000 brave - mostly elderly - residents who stayed behind. They are now trapped under a barrage of gunfire and explosions as Ukraine defends its stronghold against a fierce Russian onslaught. Nadiya Burdinska, born in Bakhmut and resolute in her decision to stay, explained: “Only a dummy wouldn’t be afraid.” “Everything is possible… if God wants it, I’ll stay alive,” she told France24. There’s no phone signal, most cars have been burnt, and Russia has ceaselessly targeted their energy and service infrastructure. Most residents have been without running water for the most part of a year. And yet on Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelensky told an EU summit: ""Nobody will give away Bakhmut. We will fight for as long as we can. We consider Bakhmut our fortress."" Zelensky vowed to defend Bakhmut despite emphasising the fighting is gruellingly “tough”. After eight months of relentless battles, Russia still does not have control of the symbolic eastern city, which is starving Putin of a major military victory he has been desperately searching for since the summer. Both sides are firmly dug in and achingly slow progress has been taking place at a very high cost to human life in scenes that have been likened to the First World War battlefields.  Exhausted Ukrainian forces have held onto, albeit scarcely, their “fortress” in the longest battle of the Ukraine war. It’s also the most symbolic. “It’s hell on earth right now; I can’t find enough words to describe it,"" Ukrainian soldier Petro Voloschenko told AP. For Russia to make genuine progress in controlling the rest of the Donetsk region – one of four regions Putin brazenly claimed to have annexed in September - then the Russian army must take Bakhmut. They are fighting up to the last ditch… there are fierce battles for every street, every house, every stairwell The salt city is also key to Russia's political plans to break Ukrainian spirit - to destroy what Voloschenko calls a ""symbol of Ukrainian invincibility"".  ""Bakhmut is the heart of Ukraine,"" he says, ""and the future peace of those cities that are no longer under occupation depends on the rhythm with which it beats."" A Ukrainian reporter speaking to soldiers fighting on the frontlines in the city was told: “The average lifespan for mobilised fighters in Bakhmut is four hours”. Russia has the luxury of sheer manpower bolstered by the Wagner Group, whose front wing is made up of largely poorly-trained and badly-equipped convict recruits.  Ukrainian officials have referred to their role on the battlefield as “cannon fodder” - expendable soldiers to be sacrificed in the front waves, whilst the private militia’s specialist troops hang back. If they survive six months at the front, they have secured their freedom at home. But many don’t. Ukrainian soldier Andriy explained: “We were fighting for about 10 hours in a row. “And it wasn’t like just waves, it was uninterrupted. So it was just like they didn’t stop coming,"" he told CNN. “It was about 20 soldiers on our side. And let’s say 200 from their side.""  He described fighting the convict army as a scene from a zombie movie, adding: “They’re climbing above the corpse of their friends, stepping on them."" Andriy said a machine gunner was stunned to find that when he would shoot at enemy soldiers, they kept on walking until they bled out. “It looks like it’s very, very likely that they are getting some drugs before they attack,” he claimed.  In a rare admission of truth, Wagner boss and Putin lapdog Yevgeny Prigozhin sought to put to bed Russian media reports that Ukrainian soldiers were leaving the city. Instead, he confirmed in a statement on Telegram that: ""The Ukrainian armed forces are not retreating. “They are fighting up to the last ditch… there are fierce battles for every street, every house, every stairwell”. But military analysts say Bakhmut is nearing tipping point, whilst Britain’s defence ministry confirmed today that Russia has made “small in advances” in its pursuit of encircling the city. The tense news comes as Ukraine braces for a suspected Russian spring offensive to commemorate the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Ukraine’s military intelligence reports estimate 500,000 conscripted soldiers are amassing on the border preparing to attack on the eastern and southern fronts. The war-torn nation has been desperately scrambling for more heavy weaponry from the West, some, but not all of which, will arrive in time. At a press conference yesterday, Ukraine’s Defence Minister Oleksii Rezniko said: ""We still, of course, expect possible Russian offensive operations, because it's February, and they like symbolism”. As Bakhmut holds almost a mythic level of importance to Ukraine, Russia will likely be intent on winning this battle ahead of their “symbolic” anniversary. “We are ready,” Rezniko said.

Ukrainian decathlon champ & ‘future Olympian’ Volodymyr Androshchuk dies in battle against Russian soldiers,"A UKRAINIAN decathlon champion has died fighting Russia. Volodymyr Androshchuk was killed in action near Bakhmut, Ukraine, on January 25. The tragic loss of the 22-year-old was confirmed by the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, who said: ""A promising athlete and a true hero. ""He could have been able to participate in the Olympic Games in Paris, if Russia hadn't invaded Ukraine. ""Why do Russians still have this privilege.""

Family and friends of Androshchuk said their final goodbyes at the man's funeral on Wednesday, February 1. His funeral was held in the western Ukrainian town of Letychiv, with hundreds mourning the death of the future athlete. Heartbreaking images showed people crying in despair as they lined up to pay their respects. Androshchuk's coffin, hoisted by Ukrainian servicemen, was carried through snow-covered streets to a cemetery to the sound of a military brass ensemble. The man is believed to have volunteered for the military and was hit by shrapnel that resulted in his death. He was involved in a battle near Bakhmut, which has seen a wave of intense fighting as Vladimir Putin continues to try to seize Ukrainian territory. Maria, a 21-year-old classmate of Androshchuk, told Reuters she imagined him winning medals for Ukraine. She said: ""Unfortunately none of this is going to happen. ""How can a terrorist state that takes millions of lives, the lives of athletes, of children, be invited anywhere. ""They need to be fully isolated."" Fellow decathlete, Dmytro Korbenko, who described himself as Androshchuk's best friend claimed Russian athletes should be banned from international sporting championships because of the atrocities they have committed. He said: ""It's obvious they're not supposed to be in sports, nor at the 2024 Olympic Games. ""He was supposed to live a long and happy life.  ""He had everything to be successful in training and in competitions."" The devastating death follows claims that the Kremlin is allegedly gearing up for a new offensive that could see 700,000 soldiers pour into Ukraine.

I’m a gran – I took up bodybuilding after being mocked by my husband & now I’m a ‘pum’ dating a man 15 years younger,"A GRANDMA who took up bodybuilding after being mocked by her husband is now dating a man 15 years younger than her.

We like paddleboarding and shopping. “We spend too much money on stupid things and have the same taste in music. “I like to call myself a puma, not a cougar, I am not old enough to be a cougar yet Sean also gets along great with my children.” Wendy had her first son at 17 years old, she had to drop out of high school, her younger son is currently 16-years-old and often accompanies her to her competitions. ""My eldest is 25 now and he and Sean get along very well,"" says Wendy. ""The first time they met my son admitted that he thought Sean was going to be a big d*******g because he is a bodybuilder. ""But they are great friends now, age has never been a problem with us. ""My eldest lives in Idaho, he has a family of his own, I have a granddaughter and another on the way. Wendy has faced mixed reactions from social media and her friends and family regarding her bodybuilding physique. “And my family and friends tell me I motivate them to work out, but then they say things like ‘I want to work out but I don’t want to look like you.’ “And some trolls on Instagram leave comments saying things like ‘you’re disgusting’ or pointed comments that I look like a man with boobs. “I don’t let it affect me after all it’s my life, and this is something I enjoy doing, and the bodybuilding lifestyle has given me so much. “Bodybuilding has given me a lot of confidence. I used to be shy. I wouldn't talk to people unless they approached me first. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17259203/took-up-bodybuilding-mocked-husband-dating-younger/
"Vladimir Putin ‘visited by doctors again after becoming weak & tired’, claims Kremlin ‘insider’","VLADIMIR Putin has reportedly been visited by doctors again after becoming ""weak & tired"", a so-called Kremlin insider has claimed. The tyrant, 70, is rumoured to be unwell - with the claims being fuelled by his bloated face and trembling legs.  Bombshell spy documents leaked to The Sun appeared to confirm he has pancreatic cancer and early-stage Parkinson's disease. And just this weekend, the former head of MI6, Sir Richard Dearlove, told us that he believes Vlad is likely suffering from an illness.  Telegram channel General SVR - which claims to be fed information by a Kremlin insider - has been pumping out unverified information since the start of the war. It is fuelling the ongoing speculation that something is very wrong with Russian leader Vlad. And its latest claim was Putin has been visited by doctors after becoming ""weak and tired"" after an event in Volgograd. Putin continues to make limited public appearances - often now preferring to chair meeting by video link. And he is cancelled a number of key appearances over the last few months, but has appeared recently at events marking the anniversary of the Siege of Stalingrad.  General SVR reported that Putin ""did not have fun"" during his meetings and public appearances on the visit. ""By evening, Putin was very tired and felt weak, doctors were invited to see him,"" it reported. ""After the next course of therapy, the president has not yet come into shape, and it is not yet clear whether he will come at all."" Reports of Putin's ill health have never been definitively verified but rumour and intrigue surrounds Vlad. And there is the ongoing question of who could replace him? Putin has been seen to be twitchy, unsteady on his feet, and out of breath on occasion. And his future is believed to be tied to his invasion's success or failure. Putin has been warned he could face an internal uprising unless he manages to achieve something in Ukraine. He had foolishly expected to steamroller Ukraine and for his soldiers to be welcomed as ""liberators"" - but they have faced a fierce fightback. Cities and regions seized at the start of the war at the end of February are now being retaken by the Ukrainians. The West is heavily supporting Kyiv - loading them up with the weapons they need to defeat Russia. But there is fears Russia is gathering for a huge offensive to coincide with the anniversary of the war on February 24. It is believed up to 500,000 soldiers could be preparing for the assault across two fronts in eastern Ukraine.  And yesterday, Putin's close pal Dmitry Medvedev warned - in certain circumstances - the Russians could use nukes on Ukraine.

How US and China could end up at war by 2025 as tensions rage after spy balloon shot down & fury over Taiwan,"FEARS of war between China and the United States are growing by the day, as tensions mount between the two superpowers. New comments from an ex-US Air Force commander revealed a conflict may be closer than we think. After the US military shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon yesterday, fears of growing unease between the two nations have been solidified.  Mike Minihan, Chief of the US Air Force's Air Mobility Command, was blunt in his thoughts on the tensions between the two countries, in a leaked memo. He said: “My gut tells me we will fight in 2025."" Minihan's comments came just days before one of the most significant flashpoints between the two superpowers in years occurred over a surveillance balloon. A balloon floated over Alaska and the continental United States, violating American airspace and sparking fear of China gathering information on American military bases. China repeatedly insisted the balloon was used for meteorological and other scientific research and had been blown off course, but the United States shot down the aircraft yesterday. Former chief of the US Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Philip Davidson, cited the threats against Taiwan as a possible trigger for war. Last year, the admiral said: “I think the threat is manifest during this decade, in fact, in the next six years."" President Joe Biden may have underestimated the threat from China, even saying at the G-20 summit in Bali that there was ""no imminent threat on the part of China to invade Taiwan."" The US has continuously sided with Taiwan as they face increasing military aggression from China. China regards the self-governing island as part of its territory and said any moves it takes towards full-scale independence will lead to an invasion. Xi Jinping has insisted that it's his party's mission to ""reunify and rejuvenate the nation"", and this ""natural requirement"" he alludes to seems to be the accruement of Taiwan. The visit of US politician Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan in 2022 prompted a furious response from Beijing, with Chinese warships and fighter jets surrounding the island in massive military exercises. Retired US Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Davis told media that he worries for the future of the two countries in the face of these threats. He said: ""I see hotheads in Beijing, and I see hotheads in the Pentagon and the various commands. And I worry about it a lot.” The ""hotheads"" in Beijing are already up in arms about the decision to shoot down the ""civilian"" balloon off the Atlantic coast. In a statement, the Chinese government said: ""China will resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of relevant enterprises and reserve the right to make further necessary responses."" It's unclear what is meant by ""further necessary responses"", yet the fear of a future conflict remains and is exacerbated by the downing of the Chinese balloon. Former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed earlier this month that China's President Xi Jinping is a bigger threat than Russia's Vladimir Putin. Pompeo went as far as to say Xi's ""vicious objective"" is to achieve total dominance across the world. He told Sky News: ""He wants hegemonic intent across the world with his Marxist-Leninist vision, and Chinese economic and political dominance in every corner of the world. “That his vicious objective. We have an obligation to the next generation to push back against it.” In October, China expert Skylar Mastro said Beijing is convinced it needs to hit America ""hard and early"" in a Pearl Harbor-style attack if the two countries go to war. While Beijing may be preparing for a lightning war to storm across the Taiwan Strait and capture the island, experts have said the war could be anything but quick. With tough beaches, rocky terrain, well-drilled defenders, and unforgiving seas, China could face the same brutal grinding warfare that Russia is facing in Ukraine. Taking Taiwan could even require Beijing to muster a force of two million troops, it's been claimed. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21281636/america-china-war-red-dawn-taiwan-balloon/
Brit soldiers brave -12C temperatures in Nato war games with tanks & helicopters just 80 miles from Russia,"BRITISH soldiers are facing temperatures as low as -12C as they take part in Nato war games just 80 miles from Russia. Flying in Chinook helicopters and charging round the snow-covered forests with tanks, the squaddies are ready for anything in the icy conditions of eastern Estonia.  The Sun was alongside our boys as they face the blistering cold just a stone's throw from the doorstep of Mad Vlad.  Putin has turned Russia into a pariah state thanks to his vicious invasion of Ukraine. And the international tensions weigh heavy on the troops.  But our soldiers are standing alongside their comrades from across Europe in the face on a belligerent Russia.  ""We can see that our Estonian counterparts are worried about what's going on with Russia. But they feel we're here to help,"" one British tank driver told The Sun.  Temperatures in Keskpolügoon, or the Central Training Area, are down to -5C, but a blisteringly cold wind means it feels like at least -9C. And it is expected to drop down to -12C in the coming days. A French soldier working with Nato joked ""It is warm!"" as he took a puff on a cigarette. The camp is around an hour and a half drive from the Estonian capital Tallinn, through snow-covered fields dotted with farmhouses and Soviet-era apartment blocks. Dense forests of fir trees provide perfect cover for camouflaged tanks and military vehicles. On the vast military base, about the size of 15,000 football pitches, Brit troops along with other Nato forces, including the native Estonian army, have been building up for huge war games featuring heavy armour, helicopters, and rocket launchers. Many of the soldiers have been here in the tiny Baltic nation bordering Russia for the past five months, conducting training drills and improving their battle readiness. All of their hard work will pay off as they take part in Nato's enhanced Forward Presence Battlegroup. They have a possible enemy nearby...they are aware they are in a risky situation. One British tank driver, a Lance Corporal in the King's Royal Hussars tank regiment, said the exercises demonstrate the closeness of the Nato forces. It's also a crucial show of support for Estonia and the other former countries in the former Soviet Union, as Vladimir Putin's bloody invasion of Ukraine approaches the one-year anniversary. The soldier continued: ""We have a close bond as part of Nato now. Nato is one team, and the Estonians have got on board with that. ""They've opened their arms to us, and they're learning from us.  ""If anything was to happen in the future, we'd be ready for anything."" One of his French counterparts, Julien, a lieutenant who commands a 30-person platoon, agreed. He said: ""It is important for the Estonians to see all of us from Nato here. It allows us to reassure them. To show them that Nato and the West are with them. ""They have a possible enemy nearby,"" he added. ""They are aware they are in a risky situation."" The training, which for many of the soldiers in Keskpolügoon started back in September, hasn't been without its challenges. One of the greatest for the British contingent has been quickly learning how to fight in the unforgiving cold of Estonia. The British tank driver went on: ""Learning to operate and fight, as well as live, in this environment is our biggest challenge."" On a day-to-day level, that means not just more thermal gear, but also learning how to handle a tank on icy roads. ""We can take the skills and drills we have learned here and take them back to the UK, or wherever we operate,"" he added.  ""We can adapt them to any battlefield."" Tank crews can spend up to four weeks in cramped conditions, with the hatches kept shut and precious little daylight. But the Brits have come to Estonia with some of their top equipment. A corporal in the British army, who works as a signaller, took The Sun through the battle crew. In a basecamp built among the frosted woods, a Bulldog FV432 armoured personnel carrier, a Panther protected patrol vehicle, and a Danish Piranha tank hulk over the surrounding soldiers. But when they miss home, the corporal said they can go into the Bulldog and make a cup of tea. The Danish and Estonian soldiers may be more used to the cold than their British counterparts, but that doesn't mean that they aren't learning from the UK. Rasmus, a deputy commander in the Danish army, explained that the Brits and Danes have been cooperating in these types of missions as far back as the 1990s during the wars in the Balkans. The highlight of the day is a thrilling staged war game between two fleets of tanks, with one chasing the other across the icy tundra of Estonia. Denmark demonstrates its new state-of-the-art German-built Leopard 2 tanks. Received two years ago, these exercises mark the first time they have been deployed outside of Denmark. Effective comms are essential for military drills such as this. The Brit signaller admitted there is a lot of pressure on people like him to make missions like this work. If the bases can't communicate with each other, he admits, ""the plans start to collapse"". Towards the end of the day, with the light quickly starting to fade, a British Chinook helicopter comes into view over the trees, sending up a cloud of snow dust that digs into the skin. The helicopter is being used to carry military equipment across the battlelines. A member of the Royal Engineering Squadron explains how important the Chinook is for such exercises. He said: ""The Chinook resupplies front-end engineering equipment. It means that we don't have to bring in on trucks on icy snowy days like today."" Now that the British Army has proven they work well in these exercises, they can be used to plough mines and set bridges across the combat zone. The Royal Engineering Squadron provides the other Nato forces with mobility, counter-mobility, and survivability, stopping the enemy in its track through placing obstacles. Britain's brave squaddies huddle around a tank in the rapidly-gathering gloom, lit cigarettes glowing in the dark. Two young soldiers show off their battalion flag - a white skull on a black background with the slogan ""Victory or Valhalla"". ""It means victory or heaven!"" one explains.

Bartender accidentally found ATM glitch and got £1MILLION before blowing THE LOT in wild five-month spending spree,"A BARTENDER had one of the best nights of his life when by pure chance he accidentally got £1million from a cash machine. It was a start of a whirlwind journey that saw him blow the whole lot in five months in a wild spending spree before ending up behind bars.  But for Dan Saunders he doesn't regret any of it and even paid one of his pals' uni fees with the stolen cash.  The barman was out drinking in his hometown of Wangaratta, Australia, when he struck lucky at the ATM. He had headed to the cash machine - and accidentally stumbled on a life-changing glitch. Dan - slightly tipsy at this point - realised for whatever reason he was able to transfer unlimited funds between his savings and credit accounts.  He originally tried to move $200 AUD - but the ATM threw up an error message saying ""transaction cancelled"". But he tried to withdraw the money anyway and got the cash. Originally he didn't think much of it, but later that night he was walking home past the same ATM. He tried it again, and again, and then again - and ended up with $1,300 in cash. All the time the ATM would say ""transaction cancelled"" - yet the money would come out anyway without actually taking any money from his bank account and giving him the cash. The following morning he phoned his bank and there seemed to be nothing untoward with his account. He twigged that between 1am and 3am in the morning that specific ATM became disconnected from the bank's network.  And this essentially allowed him to create ""infinite money"" by transferring cash between his two accounts. The transaction would only register with the bank the following day and push him into debt - but he could always withdraw more after midnight.   But you could always stay ahead of this by staying one day ahead with his sneaky transfers. I opened the book on anything – people just gave me their dreams and I fulfilled them. And so what followed with was a whirlwind as Dan decided he was going to exploit this glitch, describing it as ""addictive"".  ""I felt like a caveman discovering fire,"" he told VICE.  Dan started drawing out hundreds of pounds a night, splashing it on drinks for everyone in his local pub. He started eating out at the best restaurants in his town and throwing wild parties every weekend. And even though his ""real"" bank balance was going deeper and deeper into the red, he kept simply printing the free cash. He spent in total around $1.6million AUD (£1million) using his system - including charting a 20-seater private jet for his mate to the tune of £50k. ""We were in the air for about three hours and had filled the plane up with people,"" Saunders told The Sun Online in 2018.  ""It was a mix of old friends and new faces. We hired the whole resort, the over-water villas and ate and drank there. “I opened the book on anything – people just gave me their dreams and I fulfilled them.” Dan would parade with expensive escorts on his arm as partied his life away - enjoying expensive suits, caviar and champagne. He once hired a minibus, stopping at all the backpacker hostels in Melbourne to pick up people.  The barman then drove them out to a big estate he hired out in the stunning Yarra Valley where he hosted pool parties. And he also paid off some of his friends’ university tuition fees and sent a mate to study in France. But the guilt of what he was doing eventually caught up with him - being wracked with anxiety about he had done. He confided in his therapist who told him to hand himself in. “I think there was a small part of me that wanted it to end but I was past the point of no return, my life had changed dramatically,"" he says. He often dreamt about being caught. “One night I had a nightmare that the SWAT team was out the front of the hotel room I was staying in,"" he said. Two years passed and Saunders was finding it hard to come to terms with his overnight riches, so he started seeing psychologists. Saunders had never contacted the police, but he stopped working the glitch and once he'd blown all the money he contacted the bank in June 2011. They said that the police would get in touch with him about it - but they never did. Dan even appeared on a national news programme detailing his lifestyle. He went to several small local newspapers with his story and gave a video interview on Australian news programme, The Current Affair. Still, it was three years before Saunders was arrested on 111 counts related to fraud and theft. ""I just sat back and pleaded guilty and sort of let it all unfold in front of me,"" said Dan. In May 2016, Saunders left jail after spending a year in prison - and went back to working in a bar again on £12.50 an hour. Dan's incredible story has been charted in numerous news articles and there is even talk of it being made into a movie. And he is also telling his story in a new podcast called The Glitch produced by Podshape which is available on Spotify.

"I feared I would end up penniless but now make £45,000 a month – I’m the most successful woman over 55 at my side hustle","A 55-YEAR-OLD woman who was set to end up penniless in old age has revealed how she is now making £45,000 a month with her unique side hustle. Elaina St James, from Illinois, US, claims to be the most successful woman over 55 on OnlyFans thanks to her raunchy content online. The single mum launched her account in April 2021 and before that was struggling to make ends meet, working in a low-paid office job at £26,000 a year. But worrying she would ""never stop working"", Elaina is now making so much money, she could retire several times over. And stripping off for young men who love her ""mum bod,” she's thrilled to show the world that ""women are still sexy over 40"". “OnlyFans is a godsend – I’m finally looking at having a comfortable retirement,” Elaina told NudePR.com. “I was barely scraping by and thought I would be 75 and working at Starbucks with another job on the side. “I was really penny-pinching before, comparing frozen pizzas and always picking the cheapest option. “Now I make more money than ever before.” Elaina says she has been stunned by the reception she received online with men more than half her age subscribing to her content. ""People say that when you hit 40, you become invisible to men,” she said. ""I am proving them wrong. And my fans aren't just men in my own age bracket – most are 20- and 30-year-olds. My fans are overwhelmingly younger than me.  “Most of them probably don't want to date someone my age, but I provide a safe and fun outlet for their older women fantasies. ""I don't care about what people think about my lifestyle, I have no shame about it. Elaina currently has 172,000 adoring young fans on Instagram too who regularly comment on how they much love her look.  She said: “My brand is ‘big boobs and a smile’. “I never thought it would take off like this as I don’t have the typical model body, I don’t look perfect – but men love it. Despite her positive outlook, the model admitted that she has experienced backlash and has even losts friends over her chosen career path. “But the positives far outweigh the negatives<"" she sayd.  Being positive about ageing is part of my message – attitude is everything.” Elaina’s new career also enables her to spend more time with her teenage son, not named for privacy reasons, and fund his education including future university courses. She said: “Now I can be flexible with what times I work, so I get to spend more time with him. “I never wanted to be a burden to my son and now I can look forward to my retirement. “I can see myself doing this for another 5-10 years. I’m fit and healthy and can keep going. “I’ll do it until I have so much money I don’t need to anymore, maybe when I’m 65, we’ll see what happens. “Hopefully I won’t still be doing OnlyFans at 70 – that would be my cap!” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19990986/mum-makes-thousands-side-hustle-onlyfans/
Tourist plane carrying 321 people has engine burst into flames at 120mph & tyres explode during take off in Thailand,"A PACKED tourist plane's engine burst into flames and tyres explode in a horror take off from Thailand. The pilot had to abruptly abort his attempt to get the plane into the air after flames began spitting from one of the engines.  The aircraft was packed with 309 passengers and 12 crew as it began to move down the runway at Phuket International Airport. It is reported there was then a ""loud bang"" as fire began to spit from the engine.  The pilot aborted his takeoff - and everyone on board was forced to wait for a new plane.  Dramatic pictures and footage showed the Boeing 767-306ER hit by sudden fire due to an “engine surge”.  The landing gear also ignited in flames on the same right side of the aircraft as the aircraft aborted its departure, said reports.  Putin's airline industry is understood to be struggling as Russia deals with sanctions because of the war in Ukraine.  This 26-year-old plane operated by charter company Azur Air was en route from Phuket International Airport to Moscow when it was hit by the drama.  Passengers on board included families of men hiding from Putin's mobilisation decree.  Some had left their men in Thailand - seen as a “friendly” country by Russia - amid suspicions of a new round of conscription.  Other men were returning to Russia after running out of money, despite the fear they could be mobilised in a feared new forced recruitment drive and sent to the front.  The images and footage shows the frightening twin problems on the plane which had a total of 321 on board.  “Airline technical specialists have already started work to eliminate the malfunctions,” said a statement from the Russian airline.  “Passengers of flight ZF-3604 will be provided with a hotel, hot meals and soft drinks while waiting for departure to Moscow.” Passengers were told they would now fly on Sunday on a replacement aircraft. “The vacation continues,” one posted. “At first the takeoff was normal,” a passenger told Izvestia.  “But then there was a surge and I heard the sound of crackling. “When passengers left the plane, it was clear that the landing gear of the aircraft was damaged.” One report said the plane had been close to  taking off at 120mph when problems arose.  On Wednesday a top Russian aviation official said Western-made airliners  - which are not undergoing normal service in Russian currently due to sanctions - can be used until 2030.  ""I am confident that it has not become more dangerous to fly - and it has nothing to do with the presence or absence of original spare parts,” said Head of the Russian Federal Agency for Air Transport, Alexander Neradko. He demanded that people stop describing as  “cannibalisation” for the way planes are being kept flying in Russia by using spare parts from other aircraft. ""It appeared at the behest of those who have never worked in civil aviation and who are unaware of the fact that the practice of interchanging serviceable spare parts from jet to jet has always been widespread, even during the Soviet times,” he claimed.  ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21280040/tourist-plane-engine-burst-into-flames/
"Girl, 16, killed in shark attack named as Stella Berry after she jumped in river to swim with dolphin in Australia","THE teenage girl mauled to death by a shark after jumping off her jet ski into a river has been named.  Stella Berry, 16, a schoolgirl from Perth, was swimming in the Swan River when she was fatally attacked by a shark in front of her friends on Saturday.  The first images have been released of the victim who was believed to have been killed by a bull shark. The teen had was reportedly enjoying a day on the water and playing with jet skis with her friends when she spotted a pod of dolphins and jumped into the water to swim with them.  The shark allegedly then appeared out of nowhere and dragged her under the surface as he terrified friends watched on.  Bull sharks are known as a vicious species and have often been found lurking in rivers in Australia. A male onlooker was reported to have bravely jumped in and pulled her to safety, but she was too badly wounded to be saved.  One witness told local media that it was her boyfriend who pulled her from the river.  Paramedics arrived on the scene at 3.30pm local time and she was pronounced dead on the scene.  Joshua Banks, 16, was playing on rope swings nearby with a group of his friends when the vicious mauling took place.  The witness said: ""There were about seven of us and we were on the rope swing for around an hour or two."" ""We saw the dolphins, there were dolphins there. When all the police came by we thought we were in trouble."" Banks explained that they didn't know what was happening and they continued to jump and play in the water.  He continued: ""We were so grateful that it wasn’t one of us, of course we’re so sorry for what happened and for the family involved."" Fremantle District Acting Inspector Paul Robinson said: ""It’s an extremely traumatic event for everyone involved and obviously, anyone that knew the young girl."" Robinson added it was ""unusual"" for a shark to be so far down river, which flows from Perth into the Indian Ocean. The attack took place a mile and half up the river.  It is the first fatal shark attack recorded on the Swan River in 100 years, when a 13-year-old was killed in 1923.  However another shark mauling had occurred recently in 2021 when a father-of-two, Cameron Wrathall, was bitten on the thigh and was lucky to escape with his life.  The Fisheries Minister, Don Punch, said on Sunday: ""There’s only been six recorded historical attacks in the river, and this would make it seven."" He has said that new measures could be considered to prevent other attacks, including using shark barriers to protect swimming areas.  In a statement following the tragic incident, Punch said: “I am incredibly saddened by what has happened and I cannot begin to imagine what the victim’s family and friends are going through. “We offer them our support but understand they will need time and space as they deal with this tragedy.” Tributes have been pouring from the Perth community as Stella's friends and family mourns her death. Earlier today, Stella's friends met up on the banks of the Swan River near the site she was killed to pay their respects.  One of her friends, Laura Connolly, told ABC, that Stella was the ""sweetest and smartest girl that I knew"".  ""She was so kind. She loved art. I'd ride my bike to see her sometimes and I'd see her running."" Another friend, Teagan McArthur, said that her death ""doesn't feel real"".  ""We were all in contact with her less than 24 hours ago and now she’s not here with us."" ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21279678/girl-16-killed-in-shark-attack-named-stella-berry/
Jeremy Hunt could have billions extra to play with in his Budget thanks to gas price falls,"JEREMY Hunt could have billions extra to play with in his Budget thanks to gas price falls — heaping pressure on him to cut tax this year. Tory MPs will urge the Chancellor to slash the burden because the scaled-back energy support package will cost 90 per cent less next year. A Resolution Foundation think-tank report said the Treasury would be in line for a “big windfall” with the outlook “a little less bleak”. Senior Tory MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith said “We need to start planning for easing the tax burden.  “Forecasts of doom and gloom are wrong.  “The UK economy is in a robust position. “As we run up to the Budget we should not make the squeeze any worse. “The rise in corporation tax in April will just squeeze the economy even more. “But we do need to start planning for easing the tax burden as it hurts individuals and businesses - and get growth going.” Falling energy prices mean the estimated cost for the energy support package has fallen by around £11 billion for the next 12 months. But the drop will mean reduced tax receipts from energy producers and generators which could cost around £7 billion. But a Resolution Foundation report says other taxes will be boosted as lower energy costs raise domestic consumption and firms’ profits. Households are expected to pay 20 per cent more for energy due to the reduction of government support but overall falling prices will have a deflationary effect. The energy price guarantee will see the typical household bill at around £3,000 until April next year - up £500 on the previous 12 months. But Mr Hunt signalled last month that any tax cuts would only come “when the time is right” as he tried to dampen speculation.

Rishi Sunak accused of blocking any significant hike to Britain’s defence spending,"RISHI Sunak has been accused of blocking any significant hike to Britain’s defence spending. The chairman of the Commons Defence Committee urged the PM to change course ahead of next month’s Budget. Tory Tobias Ellwood said: “The Treasury’s pitch is being rolled to suggest no major changes in the peacetime defence budget.” It comes amid concern in Whitehall that a promised review of Britain’s security threat level could now slip beyond March’s Budget. Last autumn the Government promised to update national threat levels and reflect that in the MoD’s budget. No10 insisted that remains the case and the Integrated Review would be published before March 15. Treasury insiders say Mr Hunt is prepared to replenish stockpiles and could even provide funds to reverse troop cuts but Defence Secretary Ben Wallace is seeking a deeper funding settlement. Meanwhile Labour have vowed to “rearm Britain” and double down on support for Ukraine if it wins the next election. Shadow defence secretary John Healey said “things will get worse, not better for Russia” with Labour in No 10. He demanded a halt to Army cuts and pledged to ramp up weapons production.

Govt urged to call time on new laws which could force pubs to hire bouncers to police boozy chats,"KEMI Badenoch has been urged to call time on new laws which risk curbing pub chat. No10 insisted freedom of speech would be upheld in boozers and people will not be “silenced”. But campaigners and MPs warned legislation must be toughened up to stop claims from over-sensitive employees. As it stands, an update to equalities laws could mean employers may be held liable if staff hear something they dislike. Landlords — and football clubs — would have to take “all reasonable steps” so workers are not “harassed” — meaning more training and box-ticking.  Equalities Secretary Mrs Badenoch has been urged to sort out the mess. Toby Young, of the Free Speech Union, said hospitality venues were struggling to survive rising energy costs, inflation and train strikes so “more red tape is the last thing they need”. He said: “It’s up to Kemi to call time on this new anti-free speech measure.” Tory MP Danny Kruger said action was needed so “free speech is upheld and our much-loved pubs are not burdened by yet more red tape and curbs”. One minister added: “Has the world gone mad? This feels like Cromwellian times.” No10 said: “Freedom of speech is a vital pillar of our society. “That’s why we support an amendment to this legislation, which will ensure no one is silenced for simply expressing their legitimately held opinions.” By Toby Young, Free Speech Union IF you run a pub or a football club, you could be sued by an over- sensitive employee who overhears a politically incorrect remark by a member of the public. To limit their liability, employers will have to “protect” their workers. But more red tape is the last thing they need. It’s up to Kemi Badenoch to call time on this new anti-free speech measure.

Rishi Sunak plotting ‘100 day reshuffle’ and splitting Business Department into THREE,"RISHI Sunak was tonight plotting a major reshuffle — and even breaking up the Business department into three new Cabinet jobs. A new party chairman will be unveiled following the sacking of Nadhim Zahawi last week. And there are questions over the future of Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab. The PM has been forced to tweak his team after axing Mr Zahawi over his tax affairs controversy. Insiders say Mr Sunak will likely use the opportunity for a sweeping Whitehall shake-up. It could see a stand­alone Energy department, with Business and Trade merged and a new Science and Digital unit. Culture and Sport — currently joined with Digital — would be left as a separate department, with major implications for the make-up of the Cabinet.  Business Secretary Grant Shapps was being tipped by senior Tories to be party chairman, but others said he was likely to stay in a big ministerial job. A source said: “The focus is making government work better but in reality it leaves senior ministers looking over their shoulders.  ""And it leaves a question over the future of Dominic Raab, who faces a bullying inquiry.” But a merging of Business and Trade would trigger speculation over the future of International Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch, a former leadership contender. One source said: “These changes will put a lot of noses out of joint. There will be winners and losers with some very upset egos. ""Where does Kemi fit in?” Downing Street declined to comment last night. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/21297656/rishi-sunak-rehuffle-split-business-department/
Britain backs US shooting down of Chinese spy balloon – and says we would do the same,"BRITAIN backed the US in shooting down a Chinese spy balloon - and said we would do the same. Business Secretary Grant Shapps threw his weight behind President Biden after he ordered fighter jets to take down the mysterious object after it flew over key military sites. The Cabinet minister said yesterday: ""We fully support the US and the action they've taken. ""It cannot be right to send spy balloons floating over mainland of the United States, and the UK would always take its national security very seriously."" The move has sparked a war of words with China, who claimed it was just a weather balloon which came over America completely by accident. But Mr Shapps said the UK wasn't afraid to take bold decisions to protect the British people. He told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg programme: ""Where there is intelligence information, I do act. ""I am responsible for judging whether investments from China impact our national security. ""I have been extremely tough. ""We want to be a country that is open to investment but not in areas that might impact our national security. ""That is where we draw the line.""  Rishi Sunak last summer dubbed China as a ""threat"" - but since getting to Downing Street has been accused of rowing back on his tough talk. The PM instead would only say the rogue nation is a ""systematic challenge"" in a hint Britain would continue to work alongside them.

Ex-PM Liz Truss reignites bitter Tory civil war as she defends bid to slash taxes,"FORMER Prime Minister Liz Truss reignited a bitter Tory civil war last night as she defended her bid to slash taxes. MPs are bracing for her first major TV interview tonight after she launched her political comeback with a 4,000-word broadside in the Sunday Telegraph. In thinly veiled swipes at her successor, PM Rishi Sunak, she insisted her major economic blueprint was never given a chance and she was forced out too soon. Her return to front-line politics, in which she criticised economic orthodoxy and timid civil servants, sparked a furious row among Tories. Ex-Tory chairman Jake Berry told the BBC Truss was right to argue for tax cuts as that is what people wanted. But allies of Mr Sunak hit back, saying her approach was “clearly” wrong and Liz had not said sorry for her part in crashing the economy. Business Secretary Grant Shapps warned slashing taxes now would ""rub up against reality"" of Britain's huge Covid and Ukraine war debts. He insisted: ""You've got to be responsible… you've got to deal with the fundamentals first."" Ex-Chancellor George Osborne said the former premier's defence was ""nonsense"", telling Channel 4: ""She went out of her way not to listen. You can't just go for - cut the tax.""Tory MP Alicia Kearns added: ""The best and polite way of saying it would be - recollections do vary.""

"Migrants entering UK illegally ‘shouldn’t get rights’, declares Grant Shapps","MIGRANTS who arrive illegally “shouldn’t get rights”, Grant Shapps declared yesterday. The Business Secretary said they should be treated differently to asylum seekers who do not use traffickers. His warning came as Tories piled pressure on Rishi Sunak to pull out of the European Convention on Human Rights. The PM has privately said he is willing to leave the ECHR if it frustrates his migrant crackdown. And yesterday Mr Shapps told Sky’s Sophy Ridge that those who buy expensive tickets from people smugglers should not be afforded the same asylum rights as others. He said: “I think the direction is quite straightforward. You shouldn’t get rights if you come through illegal routes.” Mr Sunak and Home Secretary Suella Braverman are finalising plans to strip appeals rights from those who arrive illegally. But insiders fear Euro judges will try to thwart the plan. Tory MP Lee Anderson called on the PM to quit the ECHR to “restore sovereignty to Westminster”. Some 218 migrants arrived in four boats on Saturday. A record 45,000 crossed the Channel last year, but just 135 people were charged with helping them make the journey. A Home Office spokesman said: “We’ve arrested more than 320 people since we strengthened the law in June, and we remain committed to removing those who flout our laws.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21284736/migrants-uk-illegally-shouldnt-get-rights-grant-shapps/
Rishi Sunak visited Ukrainian troops training in Britain before they go to the front line,"RISHI Sunak visited Ukrainian troops training in Britain before they go to the front line, No 10 revealed. The PM saw them last weekend in the North East and told President Zelensky about it in a call yesterday. Mr Sunak said he was “inspired by their courage and the stories of their loved ones back home.” And he told the Ukrainian leader that the troops paid tribute to Mr Zelensky’s “strong leadership”. The PM vowed to make sure British kit, including newly donated Challenger 2 tanks, get there as quickly as possible. Number 10 revealed Ukrainian soldiers had already begun training on them. Meanwhile, the bodies of two British aid workers killed in Ukraine have been recovered. Andrew Bagshaw, 48, of Truro in Cornwall, and New Zealand resident Chris Parry, 28, died last month while they evacuated civilians in Soledar. A shell hit their car as they tried to rescue an elderly woman from the Russian onslaught. The bodies were returned to Ukrainian officials yesterday.

"Dominic Raab should be suspended while bullying allegations are investigated, says former Tory chairman","DOMINIC Raab should be suspended while bullying allegations against him are investigated, a former Tory party chairman has said. Sir Jake Berry said it is ridiculous the deputy PM is still in the Cabinet while complaints involving 24 civil servants are probed. He told the BBC: “The way these sorts of complaints would be dealt with in the private sector is you would be suspended while they were investigated. “It would be very bizarre if you had someone in any other workplace who wasn’t suspended pending that investigation. “MPs and ministers are not some form of special human being, I think they should just be treated like anyone else is in their workplace.” Cabinet ministers told The Sun on Sunday Mr Raab should have quit weeks “ages ago”. Mr Raab denies any wrongdoing. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21278635/dominic-raab-suspended-bullying-allegations-tory-chairman/
Penny-pinching Tory MP billed taxpayers £9 after buying Haribo sweets for a children’s competition,"A PENNY-pinching Tory MP charged taxpayers £9 after buying Haribo sweets for a children’s competition. Ex-minister Dame Caroline Dinenage ensured she got all her dosh back after splashing out on packs from Poundland as prizes for local schoolkids. A receipt obtained by The Sun on Sunday shows Parliament expense chiefs signed off payment for a total of nine bags of various Haribo treats. Dame Caroline, 51, daughter of television legend Fred, 80, made the taxpayer foot the bill for a pack of Strawberry Softies plus two bags each of Starmix, Maoam Stripes, Haribo Twin Snakes and Fruitilicious. She dished out the state-funded goodies last summer to the winners of her Queen’s Platinum Jubilee Bunting Competition, open to primary schools at her constituency in Gosport, Hants. Dame Caroline said the design contest received more than 1,200 entries, with each winner handed a packet of sweets and a certificate. She said: “There were so many fantastic designs incorporating Queen Elizabeth II, the Union Jack, corgis, and cups of tea.” Dame Caroline was a minister from 2015 to 2021, in six different government departments and under three Prime Ministers.

Home Secretary to get a new duty to remove all Channel boat migrants from the UK,"HOME Secretary Suella Braverman will get a new legal duty to remove all Channel boat migrants from the UK under a tough new crackdown. The new power is in the government’s long-awaited Bill to tackle illegal immigration after more than 45,000 arrived on our shores last year. Rishi Sunak has been working with a small team of ministers and officials on the fiercely-guarded proposals for months. It was due to be launched on January 31, but has been delayed until the last week of February amid intense legal wrangling behind the scenes. There are concerns at the top of government that Attorney General Victoria Prentice could be wobbly and scupper the plans. The PM has vowed to “stop the small boats” as a priority. His new Bill will create a new duty on the Home Secretary to “remove as soon as practicable any person who comes to the UK illegally who has not come directly from a country where their life is threatened”. This will cover all arrivals in small boats from France. The PM will also seek to stop these people claiming asylum through a new “detain and deport” model which would see them held in centres and flown to another country within days. But the key issue being discussed is how to make it “legally watertight” so the tough measures are not overturned in the courts. Rishi is considering inserting “notwithstanding clauses” into the Bill which would make it clear UK courts can ignore interim rulings by the European Court of Human Rights. It was one of these interim rulings that blocked the Rwanda deportation flight. Mr Sunak wants to deport illegal immigrants within days. This would help to stop the endless cycle of asylum claims and appeals based on the fact the person had been living in Britain for some time. The Home Office is also considering stripping Channel boat migrants of their right to appeal their automatic exclusion from the asylum system. Another option being looked at is changing the law so a Channel migrant can only lodge an appeal once they have been deported. Government sources said Rishi and Suella both agree the crackdown must be ultra tough, but there are fears the Attorney General could go soft. A source said: “Victoria Prentice could end up being the biggest problem.” Former Home Secretary Priti Patel said Brits are “fed up with our asylum system being abused”. Writing in today’s Sun on Sunday, she warned Mr Sunak that failure to sort out Britain’s borders would be “catastrophic for the party when the nation next heads to the polls” She demanded Mr Sunak hurry up and enact the Nationality and Borders Bill she steered through Parliament which she said will help end bogus asylum claims. Another senior Tory MP said expectations for Rishi’s new crackdown are sky-high and he must deliver. They said: “You can’t keep telling people Santa is coming but the bells never ring.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/21276516/home-secretary-legal-duty-remove-channel-boat-migrants/
Militant rail unions told to take ‘final’ pay deal and end strike chaos,"Militant rail unions have been told the pay deal on the table is the “best and final offer” by ministers. Rail minister Huw Merriman has thrown down an ultimatum to the RMT, telling them to ballot their members over a new pay deal.  He urges them to put it to their members - recommending them to accept - in next 48 hours. The union’s executive is mulling over a fresh nine per cent pay deal over two years, raising hopes the long running row could be over. Writing in the Sun on Sunday, Mr Merriman said: “This is the best and final offer possible.” He added: “No one wins by prolonging this dispute, particularly rail workers.  ""As January credit card bills land, some striking workers have lost thousands of pounds in lost pay on strike days and are missing out on the five per cent back-dated pay. “In the meantime, the railway itself risks withering on the vine, unable to make the changes it needs to grow and losing the faith of a generation of rail passengers.” Pleading with the RMT to accept the deal he said: “The future of the rail network is on the line. “Put the latest offers to your members, encourage them to accept, and help us build the modern sustainable railway Britain deserves.” Even before becoming Rail Minister, I was a passionate advocate for our railways.  The after effects of Covid have left our rail network in a financially perilous place.  Whether it’s due to hybrid working or just being fed up with ongoing industrial action, passengers aren’t returning in the same numbers.  The industry needs fundamental reform – to deliver better services, to earn more income, and to get passengers back on board. Since we were appointed in October, the Transport Secretary and I have been trying to bring the negotiating parties together and facilitate productive discussions. We want to resolve these industrial disputes. We’re making some progress, with discussions with the RMT being the most developed.  There’s a generous offer on the table too – a 5% + 4% pay rise over two years, with last year’s increase being paid in a lump sum – an offer which also disproportionately benefits the lowest paid.  Two unions, the TSSA and Unite, have already accepted this offer for their Network Rail members. This is the best and final offer possible. There just isn’t the public money available for inflation busting pay rises.  That would only be possible if we raised your taxes. This isn’t justified when, through modernisation and reform, the railway industry could fund those pay rises itself. Modernisation will mean new technology can speed up driver training and make working conditions on the track safer. By formalising Sunday working, we can take advantage of the rise in weekend leisure travel that we’ve seen after Covid. Staff will benefit from more flexible working patterns and multiskilled roles. These changes are in line with many sectors across the country and they’re essential for any 21st century railway. No one wins by prolonging this dispute, particularly rail workers.  As January credit card bills land, some striking workers have lost thousands of pounds in lost pay on strike days and are missing out on the 5% back-dated pay.  In the meantime, the railway itself risks withering on the vine, unable to make the changes it needs to grow and losing the faith of a generation of rail passengers. My message to the RMT is clear: the Government has done our bit – we’ve met with you, listened to you and facilitated a best and final offer on pay and reform for you.  The future of the rail network is on the line. Put the latest offers to your members, encourage them to accept, and help us build the modern sustainable railway Britain deserves.

Sir Keir Starmer under new pressure to condemn strike misery after 160 Labour MPs stand on picket lines,"SIR Keir Starmer is under new pressure to condemn strike misery — as it emerges 160 Labour MPs have stood on picket lines. And while millions of commuters faced travel chaos yet again yesterday, Aslef rail union chief Mick Whelan warned the crippling strikes could go on for three years. Most trains were cancelled across the country as thousands of Aslef and RMT members walked out over pay and conditions. Mr Whelan revealed that despite Labour boss Sir Keir’s ban on his top team being seen on picket lines, plenty of backbenchers had joined strike protests. He told reporters on a picket line in Euston, central London, he would welcome any Labour MPs with open arms.  He said: “What Keir said was that he wouldn’t have the Shadow Cabinet on picket lines. “We’ve had 160 Labour MPs across the country on our picket lines at different times, so they do come and support. “I know most of them personally. They are friends and trade unionists.  “They are not anti what we are doing.” Mr Whelan apologised to reporters for his late picket line arrival yesterday, joking he was delayed by “bloody rail strikes”. Tory MP Paul Bristow said: “The cat is out of the bag, union bosses calling shadow ministers friends and supporters. “Labour MPs are putting union bosses before hard-working British families.” PM Rishi Sunak accused Sir Keir of siding with “extremist protesters and union bosses” as they clashed over strikes last week.

Militant teacher and union official probed for suggesting Conservatives are better off dead,"A MILITANT teacher and union official was last night under investigation for suggesting Conservatives are better off dead.

The striking National Education Union has now launched a probe after being approached by the Sun. Ms Preston, a committee member of the Tower Hamlets branch in East London, could be kicked out if a meeting of bosses finds against her. Last week the Corbynista posted a photo of a placard saying: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory.  “The only good Lib Dem is a dead Lib Dem.”  She praised her “student of the week” who made it. Tory MP Brendan Clarke-Smith, an ex-teacher, said Ms Preston’s remarks drove “a coach and horses” through the NEU’s claims to be politically neutral. Ms Preston apologised, saying: “I should not have used such language and would not do so again, and I unreservedly apologise.” A union spokesperson said: “The NEU in no way condones the use of violent language or imagery.” It confirmed it is investigating.

Boris Johnson insists Tories WILL win next election with Rishi Sunak as he sits down with Nadine Dorries in TalkTV chat,"BORIS Johnson has insisted the Tories WILL win the next general election, despite dismal polling. Speaking on TalkTV's new show Friday Night With Nadine, which airs at 8pm today, the ex-PM admitted Rishi Sunak can lead his party to victory.  The Tories are currently polling at around 26%, a staggering 25 points behind Labour. With a general election due by January 2025, pressure is piling on the PM to turn fortunes around.  BoJo said: ""The Conservative Party can certainly win the next election."" Boris also confessed he never ""knowingly"" attended illegal lockdown parties. And he promised he didn't try and cover any up either. ""I hope it's obvious to everybody, that anybody who thinks I was knowingly going to parties that were breaking lockdown rules in Number 10, and then knowingly covering up parties that were illicit that other people were going to, that’s all strictly for the birds. ""And if anybody thinks like that they’re out of their mind.” The ex-PM is facing a probe by the Commons Privileges Committee into whether he knowingly lied to MPs about partygate. Hearings are expected to begin within weeks, with witnesses submitting written and oral evidence. “I’ve got to wait for this thing to conclude,"" he said. ""What I would say is that we all thought what we were doing - or certainly, I thought what we were doing - was within the rules. ""And what we certainly thought was that we were working blindingly hard on some massive priorities for the country."" Away from parties, the ex-PM discussed how Brexit helped to save lives during the pandemic by enabling a speedy vaccine rollout. “It is literally true that Brexit helped save lives,"" Boris said.

Top Whitehall official ‘knew about bullying allegations against Dominic Raab BEFORE he was made Deputy Prime Minister’,"A TOP Whitehall mandarin was allegedly told of a bullying complaint against Dominic Raab BEFORE he was made Deputy Prime Minister. According to The Times, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case was personally informed of a complaint being looked into by the Ministry of Justice. But he was still appointed as Deputy PM by Rishi Sunak last year. The new information raises questions about whether Mr Case warned the PM about Mr Raab. No10 refused to deny that Mr Sunak had been informally warned about his conduct before he put him in the Cabinet. Downing St would only say he was ""not aware of any formal complaints"" at the time. A No10 spokesperson said: ""The Justice Secretary's appointment went through the usual process and at the time the Prime Minister was not aware of any formal complaints. “You have since seen the action he took in response to the formal complaints to ensure the facts are established following a proper and independent process."" The Deputy PM is currently facing an independent investigation into multiple claims that he mistreated staff. He denies ever bullying civil servants.  Government insiders have warned the brewing scandal was reaching a ""breaking point"". One official in the Ministry of Justice told The Sun it feels like a ""bomb could drop"" any minute. Sources close to Mr Raab say he wants to fight to clear his name. The Deputy PM denies all the claims against him and was witnessed in the Commons on Wednesday mouthing ""it's not true"" when Labour boss, Sir Keir Starmer, savaged the PM over his handling of the affair. This week ex-Culture Secretary and top Boris Johnson ally Nadine Dorries weighed in on the affair, saying if she were Mr Raab she'd quit. ""If I were Dominic Raab and I was under this avalanche of accusations being made against me I think I would want to stand down, I would want to dedicate my time to clearing my name and refuting those allegations,"" Ms Dorries told TalkTV. ""And I think Dominic's probably going to get to that position pretty soon."" An MoJ spokesman said: “There is zero tolerance for bullying across the civil service. The deputy prime minister leads a professional department, driving forward major reforms, where civil servants are valued and the level of ambition is high.  ""There is an independent investigation under way and it would be inappropriate to comment further on issues relating to it until it is completed.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/21260696/whitehall-official-knew-about-bullying/
Ed Miliband U-turns on his demand for Britain to ditch fossil fuels – admitting we’ll need them for years,"SHADOW climate chief Ed Miliband today demanded Britain ditch fossil fuels, then admitted we’ll need them for years.  He U-turned after first saying Labour would use only green renewables by 2030. Mr Miliband slapped down calls for new oil and gas licences, saying they would take too long to deliver results. It comes as oil giant Shell recorded the highest profits in their entire 115-year history, a staggering £32billion - prompting calls for even bigger windfall taxes. Mr Miliband insisted that more drilling in the North Sea would be ""wrong"" despite soaring prices around the world. He says Labour would use only green renewables by 2030 to create electricity - despite 42 per cent of it currently coming from gas-fired power stations. But he admitted under a Labour government they would carry on using the energy in the North Sea for ""a long time to come"". Critics say banning new licences would only mean having to import more oil and gas from abroad instead. Former Labour boss, Mr Miliband said: “We’re going to carry on using the North Sea, including under a Labour Government, for a long time to come, you’re right about that.""  He insisted that big giants must face even higher taxes to curb eye-watering profits. Industry chiefs hit out at the shadow business secretary and accused him of ""misrepresenting"" the global profits of energy companies. Just five per cent of Shell's earnings come from the UK - and the rest is global. Mike Tholen, Offshore Energies UK’s director of sustainability, said it was wrong to offer false hopes to hard-pressed consumers that higher windfall taxes would help them. And he said hiking it up from 75 per cent would risk even more firms taking their businesses abroad. He said: “These calls for extra windfall taxes on profits made outside the UK make no sense and could never be implemented.  “The UK is subject to global tax agreements which say that it cannot tax profits made by companies outside of the UK. “The UK cannot then impose a second tax just because the group has its headquarters in the UK. If we did, they would all leave. “Our leading politicians in all parties know very well how global tax law works and we would call on them to avoid these misrepresentations.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21258192/ed-miliband-u-turns-on-fossil-fuels/

He made the comment when asked if there was a fish hanging on the wall that would sing ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"" on demand, like Tony Blair had. Eagle-eyed viewers pointed out it was Bobby McFerrin who sang Don’t Worry, Be Happy’, while Bob Marley sang ‘don’t worry about a thing’ in the song Three Little Birds. Previous PMs have raised eyebrows with their music choices, including Gordon's Brown's claims to listen to the Arctic Monkey's to pump himself up in the mornings. David Cameron was mocked for his love of The Killers, and Theresa May went viral for her awkward dancing to Abba.

Rishi declares ‘biological sex matters’ & says trans athletes in women’s sport is considered ‘unfair’ in TalkTV chat,"RISHI Sunak declared ""biological sex really matters"" as he blasted the unfairness of transgender athletes competing in women's sport. After Nicola Sturgeon and Keir Starmer both tied themselves in knots over the definition of a woman, the PM insisted ""of course, I know what a woman is, an adult human female."" Speaking to Piers Morgan on TalkTV, Mr Sunak hit out at the trans debate saying ""it doesn't strike most people as being fair."" He added: ""Whether it's sex, whether it's women's spaces, whether it's prisons, biological sex really matters.  ""And actually we saw that recently with what’s going on in Scotland."" Asked to define a woman, the PM added: ""I'm married to one. I have two daughters.  ""And it's really important that they grow up in a society where their needs are respected, whether it's, you know, how they want to be treated when they're in changing rooms or sports, but also their safety."" Asked about pay rise demands from nurses following a wave of strikes in the NHS, Mr Sunak said ""exemptions"" should be made for them. But he stopped short of promising free parking for nurses outside hospitals, a benefit enjoyed over the pandemic. Piers blasted it ""unfair"" and ""ridiculous"" that nurses pay up to £1000 a year on parking. But Mr Sunak replied: ""Everyone watching this show will get to work in lots of different ways. ""Of course I’m happy to look at that. Of course I am."" Asked whether deportation flights to Rwanda are ""ever going to happen"", Mr Sunak insisted ""Yes"". He explained the Government are working their way through the courts on the issue but acknowledged there are actors who will ""try and frustrate this"". Despite this, he said Rwanda is ""a system that I think the vast majority of people watching will say, that 'sounds reasonable'"". Probed on UK support for Ukraine, Mr Sunak did not rule out sending British jets. But he stressed: ""These are incredibly sophisticated pieces of equipment that require months if not years for people to be trained on. ""It’s not just the equipment it’s also the capabilities and training that come alongside that."" On Wednesday, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace also refused to rule out sending planes to the war-torn nation. Piers then turned to Mr Sunak's love of romcoms, with the Prime Minister admitting he was a fan of 2003 Christmas flick Love Actually. He also revealed he proposed to Akshata - his wife of 13 years - on cliffs overlooking the sea in California. Asked what love meant to him, he replied: ""I wouldn’t be able to do this job without her love and support. ""I definitely am batting above my average.""  Here we pick out the most telling exchanges in the interview: RETURN TO POWER PM: You got pretty much the worst imaginable hospital pass any incoming PM could ever wish to receive, which begs the question, what on earth did you want to do this for? RS: For me it’s about duty. There’s a concept in Hinduism called dharma, which roughly translates into duty and that’s how I was raised. ‘SUNAKISM’ AND HOPE PM: What’s the right mantra right now for the public? So many people are suffering. So many are worrying. What’s your message to them? RS: It’s have hope. Have hope because I can make it better, and I will make it better. That’s what I’m working day and night to do. PM: What is Sunakism? RS: First of all, it’s about making sure people can feel proud of the UK, proud of our country and that they have peace of mind that things are going to be better for their children and grandchildren. That’s what I’m driven to deliver. FIRST 100 DAYS PM: How would you assess your first 100 days? RS: I came in and it was a challenging situation. But I’m proud of what we’ve achieved. I’m proud. PM: What have you achieved? RS: First, and most importantly, is taking action to stabilise the economy. People were absolutely terrified about what was going to happen to their mortgages, what was going on.I came in and we took pretty decisive action in the autumn statement to put in place an economic plan that brought borrowing under control, calmed the markets down, made sure that the increase in interest rates is going to be far less than people had feared. And that’s going to make an enormous difference to millions of people’s lives. BORDERS PM: One of the key things of Brexit was supposed to be getting control of our borders. It seems to be completely out of control. What are you actually going to do about that? RS: Fairness really matters to me and I don’t think the current situation is fair. People coming here illegally, it’s not fair on those who are working hard, paying taxes, relying on public services. It’s not fair on those who migrate here legally and it’s actually not fair on those who desperately need our help from around the world and we’re not in a position to be able to help them because of what’s happening. We have to fix all those things. The system that we need  is one whereby, if you come here illegally, you should be swiftly detained and then in a matter of days or weeks we will hear your claim, not months and years, and then we will safely remove you somewhere else. PM: Is Rwanda going to happen? RS: Yes. We’re working our way through the courts with that and, of course, there are going to be people who try and frustrate this. STRIKES AND THE NHS PM: You’re being very resolute in standing up to the unions. It’s not proving very popular to the public. Do you not feel this duty that you talked about to actually take care of nurses and say, ‘Actually we do have to make certain exceptions’?RS: You’re right, nurses should be an exception and that’s because they do an incredible job. People forget that during Covid, when I was Chancellor, we instituted a public sector pay freeze because wages for most people were going down. So everyone working in the public sector didn’t see their wages rise during Covid. You know what’s the one exception to that? It was people in the NHS. It was nurses. PM: But are you going to deliver again now you’re PM? RS: I would love to give the nurses a massive pay rise. Who wouldn’t? Certainly would make my life easier, wouldn’t it? Right, of course I would love to do that if I could. PM: Well put them on one then. RS: It’s about choices. Right now money going into the NHS is the biggest it’s ever been but we have to put that in lots of different places. We need to hire more doctors, more nurses. We need more scanning equipment so we can detect cancers. TORY ‘SLEAZE’ PM: Are you comfortable about Dominic Raab staying in his job and not being suspended pending resolution of this investigation [into bullying allegations]? RS: Yes, because I believe in due process. I believe people should have a fair hearing and that’s why we have an independent adviser. UKRAINE PM: Boris Johnson has been on manoeuvres, meeting President Zelensky, Senate leaders in America, almost acting like he’s still PM. Nadine Dorries has interviewed him for TalkTV and he says that you’re a submarine PM. Is it time to put the periscope up and unleash a little torpedo to remind Boris who the PM is? RS: On Ukraine, I’m proud that I’ve been able to shift to a more proactive strategy. PM: Will you send jets? RS: We are always talking to the Ukrainians about the right support. GENDER PM: The world’s most controversial question bizarrely has become what is a woman? We know that Nicola Sturgeon can’t answer that. We know that Keir Starmer can’t answer that. You’re the British Prime Minister, what is a woman? RS: Of course, I know what a woman is, an adult human female. What you’re actually asking when you ask that question is, I think, what’s my approach and view about how we as a society grapple with a situation where people are questioning or wanting to change their gender, their identity. PM: We have just had the shocking case in Scotland where a male rapist who raped two women before he comes to trial suddenly decides to transition to be supposedly a woman. He gets convicted as a woman and then gets sent first of all to a woman’s prison where there will be other women for him to attack. It shows the problem of limitless gender self-identity, this is where it takes us. RS: I completely agree with you. It absolutely does show some of the challenges with this. We have to recognise the challenges that poses particularly for women’s safety as we’ve just been discussing. That’s why biological sex really matters. PM: To me, it’s immutable, it’s biological sex. When you see what’s happening in sport, where you see trans women athletes demolishing women, female athletes, what do you feel about that? RS: Well, I think that doesn’t strike most people as being fair, right? So that’s why when it comes to these questions, biological sex matters. RISHI THE GEEK RS: I’m a big Star Wars fan. PM: What force do you feel is with you? RS: I hope The Force is with me. You need it in this job PM: Are you still a Coke addict? RS: Yes, down to one a week ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21256529/rishi-sunak-interview-talktv-trans/
Rishi Sunak admits he’s ‘100 per cent’ punching above his weight with wife – as he reveals romantic proposal,"RISHI Sunak last night declared the love of his doting wife gets him through the day - as he admitted he was ""100 per cent"" punching above his weight. In his most personal interview yet, the PM revealed how his other half Akshata Murthy gives him the ""extra support"" to do the gruelling job ""when things are tough"". He spilled all about his romantic proposal during a cliff-top walk in California, and how he was a huge fan of mushy rom com films like Love Actually. Rishi told Piers Morgan in an exclusive sit-down with TalkTV in Downing Street: ""Yes I definitely am batting above my average. ""I wouldn't have been able to do this job without her love and support.""  When grilled on what love means to him, the PM said: ""There's lots of different aspects to it… ""The bit I'm probably most focused on at the moment and the bit that means most to me at the moment is the support that she gives me doing this job.""  He opened up about when he got down on one knee to his now wife, during a stay at a gorgeous hotel in California.  The hotel in question is thought to be the £750-a-night, five-star Ritz-Carlton retreat - set in the clifftops and boasts two championship golf courses and panoramic views. The PM said: ""We got engaged in a place called Half Moon Bay - it was a place that when we were students, we met when we were studying together in the States, and we used to walk in this area and look up at this nice fancy hotel that we never could stay in. ""Then I surprised her and we did go and stay there.  ""But before that we went for a walk along the cliffs and we were alone and that’s where I proposed.""  The pair have two kids, Krishna and Anoushka, and share their red lab, Nova. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21256659/rishi-sunak-wife-akshata-proposal/
"Has Rishi Sunak got what it takes to fix broken Britain? He’s talked the talk, now he must walk the walk","Has Rishi Sunak got what it takes to fix broken Britain? That’s the burning question I most wanted answered when we met in the kitchen of his Downing Street flat, and I’m sure Sun readers and TalkTV viewers are just as keen to know too. Over the past 30 years, I’ve met nine British PMs – Thatcher, Major, Blair, Brown, Cameron, May, Johnson, Truss and now Sunak. They were all very different in character and encountered all manner of varied crises. Watch Piers Morgan's bombshell interview with Rishi Sunak tonight at 8pm on Sky 526, Virgin Media 606, Freeview 237, Freesat 217 or on Fox Nation in the US But none faced the sheer volume of massive obstacles the current resident of No10 has inherited. The good news is that Sunak’s under no illusion as to the scale of the challenge facing him and his government, and he knows it’s going to take a lot of very hard work – and luck! - to turn things around. The bad news is that it’s all going to take time, and the patience of severely disgruntled voters, and Sunak doesn’t have the luxury of being able to rely on either of those before the next election. By the time we finished our 45-minute chat, I felt I knew our new leader a lot better, and I was impressed. Sunak came across as intelligent, thoughtful, more personable than I’ve seen him in previous interviews, even surprisingly romantic, and utterly determined to do everything he can to fix things. He seems like a serious person who knows he’s doing a serious job. Whether he can rescue the country from our current malaise, or save the Tories from electoral oblivion, remains to be seen, but if he fails it won’t be through lack of effort. I suspect voters will like Rishi Sunak more after watching this interview than they did before, especially when he talks about his wife. But likeability alone won’t be enough. He’s talked the talk, now he must walk the walk or the long-suffering British people will be unforgiving at the ballot box. Piers Morgan's full interview with Rishi Sunak will air tonight at 8pm on TalkTv. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21255270/piers-morgan-rishi-sunak/
"Cash for military will need to increase for next 20 YEARS, Defence Sec Ben Wallace suggests","MILITARY spending may need to rise for TWENTY YEARS as the UK faces a more dangerous world, the Defence Secretary said today. Cabinet Minister Ben Wallace revealed a ""growing proportion"" of cash will be needed in an effort to keep the nation safe. He is currently locked in talks with Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to agree a settlement for short-term inflationary pressures ahead of the Budget in mid-March - but pointed to the long-term concerns. Mr Wallace said:  ""There's a recognition that as the world gets more dangerous, unstable, defence should continue to get a growing proportion of spend, we can then debate how much that proportion should be. ""But my point is the direction of travel is: the world is more dangerous and unstable, and likely to remain so for a decade or two."" His warning comes after he condemned the ""hollowed out"" military in recent decades under governments of all parties. Mr Wallace along with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly was speaking in Portsmouth following the conclusion of a two-day summit with counterparts from Australia.  He also said Russia is resorting to  the brutality of the “First World War” in the Ukraine war. He highlighted their tactics dating back close to 100 years as Moscow counts close to 200,000 casualties since the invasion. His comments came as he responded to urgent calls from ex-Prime Minister Boris Johnson to send fighter jets to the country in an effort to stop Russian aggression. He added:  “I’m very open to examining all sorts of systems, not just jets - but these things don't always happen overnight. “But I can say we’re not putting Ukrainians at risk.  “Even if tomorrow morning we announced we were going to put them in fast jets, that would take months - you're suddenly having to learn to pilot a fast jet, so there is no magic wand in this horrendous conflict.” He added:  “Right now what the Ukrainians need is the ability to form military formations on the ground in order to use combined armoured manoeuvre to push back Russian forces. ""That is how you defeat the human wave attacks the Russians are currently having to resort to - and they are resorting to First World War level type of attacks, with subsequent casualties to match.” Ukrainians will also begin training from Monday as they learn to use our Challenger 2 tanks in the war effort. Both Rishi Sunak and Mr Wallace want to send a squadron of tanks to the country as soon as possible and could reach eastern Europe by the end of March.

The biggest challenges facing the Prime Minister on his 100th day in Downing St ahead of 2025 election,"RISHI Sunak has been Prime Minister of the UK for a milestone 100 days - but he's got a mountain to climb if he wants to win the next election. With a General Election due by January 2025, Mr Sunak doesn't have long to get his party in shape for a major showdown with Sir Keir Starmer. The Tories are currently polling at 26%, a staggering 25 points behind Labour. Following a tumultuous 2022, which saw the party knife two of its leaders, Mr Sunak has pledged himself as the man to finally steady the ship. He's also vowed to clear out sleaze from the Conservative ranks and lead a government of “integrity and accountability”. Mr Sunak's big pitch to nation is to achieve five key pledges: stop the boats, halve inflation, grow the economy, reduce debt and slash NHS waiting times. If he manages to achieve them all the Tories will be in a much stronger position to fight an election. Mr Sunak will set out his stall tonight in an unmissable exclusive TalkTV interview with Piers Morgan.  But there's a huge pile of problems still in the PM's way.  Here are some of the main ones.  The Deputy PM is currently being probed by an independent investigator into whether he bullied civil servants.  If found guilty he'll be the second cabinet member found to have broken the ministerial code within weeks. On Sunday Mr Sunak fired then-Tory Chairman Nadhim Zahawi  following questions over his tax affairs.  If two senior Tories are deemed to have fallen below standards, Mr Sunak will face tough questions over his sense of judgement and commitment to integrity.  Labour see Tory sleaze as a primary battlefront in the upcoming elections. Mr Sunak is engaged in a long and tough battle with union chiefs, who show no sign of backing down. Unions representing a range of public sectors are demanding inflation busting pay rises. But Mr Sunak is adamant that is unaffordable and will only make inflation worse.  Caught in the middle are members of the public, who are faced with indefinite disruption to their kids' education, health and transport.  Unions inflicted misery on nine in ten schools yesterday — and threatened another walkout if their pay demands are not met. Strikes by tens of thousands of teachers at the majority of sixth-form colleges and schools left classrooms sitting empty. Just over one in ten schools fully opened amid industrial action by an estimated 200,000 members of the National Education Union. Meanwhile, thousands of ambulance workers, rail workers, civil servants and nurses are committing to ongoing industrial action unless a new pay deal is reached. To tackle the issue, the PM is pushing through a new Bill that would force minimum service levels in key public sectors. Millions of Brits are struggling to buy food and heat their homes as the cost of living crisis hits household finances. With inflation soaring at 10.5%, the use of foodbanks have soared and Brits are struggling to pay the bills. On top of that, the tax burden is at its highest rate since WWII.  Mr Sunak vowed to halve inflation by the end of the year. But growth forecasts for the UK are bleak, with the IMF saying it expects (GDP) to contract by 0.6% in 2023. Global factors such as the war in Ukraine and the pandemic play a big part in today's economic mess.  Nonetheless, by 2025 if households aren't seeing more money in the bank, the General Election could be a steal for Labour.  Tory infighting has somewhat calmed since the chaotic final days of Liz Truss. But bitter divides in the party remain.  A small group of Boris Johnson allies are desperate to get their man back in No10. They are still raging about the fact the ex-PM was deposed in the first place. And they think Boris is the only man who can take the fight to Sir Keir and win the next election. So far none of BoJo's backers are causing too great a scene. They're picking battles carefully, with one former minister telling The Sun they'll ""hold Rishi to account"" as and when they see fit.  They said they ""hate"" Mr Sunak and don't believe he's a ""real Tory"".  Another former minister said they're waiting until after the May local elections to decide whether to make any big moves against the PM. The Conservatives are expected to get a thrashing in the Red Wall, creating an optimal opportunity for Boris fans to strike. Away from BoJo nostalgia there's growing anger at the Britain's sky-high tax burden. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has effectively ruled out cuts in the March budget, insisting inflation must come down first. But there's only so much patience in the Tory ranks for high taxes and growing frustration could soon see growing rebellions from MPs in the Commons and media.  The NHS is said to be ""on its knees"" as it battles a host of crises. A staggering 7 million Brits are currently sitting on hospital waiting lists. And ambulance and casualty delays hit record highs in December. The average response time for Brits needing an emergency responder for a stroke, severe burns or chest pain was 93 minutes, five times the 18 minute target. Meanwhile, nurses, physios and ambulance workers have committed to ongoing industrial action unless ministers agree to an above-inflation pay rise.  This week the PM vowed to slash NHS waiting lists in record time as he announced a major expansion of hospital beds and ambulance vehicles. In his second ""PM Connect"" Q&A with health workers, Mr Sunak pledged the ""largest and fastest ever improvement in emergency waiting times in NHS history"". Outlining his four point plan, the PM promised to increase hospital capacity, expand staffing levels, speed up discharges and improve NHS 111.

Rishi Sunak threatens unions with major change to strike laws to stop teacher chaos after parents left in the lurch,"RISHI Sunak is considering a fresh crackdown on teaching unions in the wake of chaotic school strikes. The PM is weighing up adding education to a list of public sectors that will be forced to provide minimum service levels during days of industrial action. A new Bill going through Parliament will eventually force some doctors, nurses, train operators and emergency services personnel to show up at work even if they voted to strike. No10 hoped to reach a voluntary agreement with education unions on minimum service. But after yesterday's strike, where heads were given little to no notice over how many teachers would show up, this could become mandatory. A No10 spokesperson said: ""In terms of the minimum service legislation we are retaining the ability to apply that to education. ""That's not a step we are taking in the first instance. Obviously we will keep that under review and look at potential further strike action and disruption."" Unions inflicted misery on nine in ten schools yesterday — and threatened another walkout if their pay demands are not met. Strikes by tens of thousands of teachers at the majority of sixth-form colleges and schools left classrooms sitting empty. Just over one in ten schools fully opened amid industrial action by an estimated 200,000 members of the National Education Union. Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said: “One school closure is too many and it remains deeply disappointing the NEU proceeded with this disruptive action.” The PM also hit out in a thinly-veiled attack on the strikes which left pupils, many still playing catch-up after the pandemic, missing lessons. He told the Commons: “I am clear that our children’s education is precious and they deserve to be in school today being taught.” On a day of paralysis likened to lockdown, the teaching staff were joined by train drivers and civil servants on Walkout Wednesday — with 500,000 downing tools. Militant teaching union leaders have offered ministers a stark choice of an inflation-busting pay hike or further strikes. They demanded Ms Keegan “step up with concrete and meaningful proposals” by February 28. Joint NEU chiefs Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney insisted that their members will do “whatever it takes” to get a new pay deal. The warning came as millions of parents had to mind their kids. They will also be forced to rip up work schedules with a series of regional walkouts and two more national strike days planned.

Labour MP forced to apologise after calling Israeli government ‘fascist’,"A LABOUR MP was forced to apologise for calling the Israeli government “fascist” and an “apartheid state”. Kim Johnson said sorry in the House of Commons after she was slapped down by Labour chief Sir Keir Starmer for her “unacceptable” remarks at PMQs. Labour said the Chief Whip would be speaking to her about the remarks. The Liverpool Riverside MP said there are “far-right elements” in the Israeli government. But she said she was wrong to have used the term “fascist” and said it was “particularly insensitive given the history of the state of Israel”. She added she recognised the use of “apartheid state” was “insensitive”. Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge called Ms Johnson's language “dangerous”. The former veteran frontbencher said: “This language is unacceptable and dangerous.

Defence Secretary refuses to rule out sending fighter jets to Ukraine – but not at the moment,"BRITAIN’S Defence Secretary tonight refused to rule out sending fighter jets to Ukraine. But Ben Wallace suggested it was “not the right approach” at the moment. Speaking to reporters, he said: “I’ve learned two things; never rule anything in and never rule anything out. “This is not a solid decision. For now, I don’t think that’s the right approach … What’s going to move on this conflict this year is going to be the ability for Ukrainians to deploy Western armour against Russia.” It comes as former boss Boris Johnson doubled down on his plea for the UK to send fighter jets to Ukraine. He said on a visit to the US to bolster support for the war-torn nation: “All I will say is that every time we have said it will be a mistake to give such and such an item of weaponry, we end up doing it and it ends up being the right thing for Ukraine. “All I’m saying is save time, save money, save lives. “Give the Ukrainians what they need as fast as possible.” Cabinet Minister Oliver Dowden told ITV’s Peston show tonight that the government didn’t rule out sending fighter jets to Ukraine. He said: “It’s a bit premature to start talking about jets and everything else but of course we don’t rule anything off the table.  “There’s training times and so on associated with that so it’s not an immediate solution.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21245910/ben-wallace-refuses-rule-out-fighter-jets-ukraine/
Unions inflict misery on nine out of ten schools and threaten another walkout if pay demands aren’t met,"UNIONS inflicted misery on nine in ten schools today — and threatened another walkout if their pay demands are not met.

They will also be forced to rip up work schedules with a series of regional walkouts and two more national strike days planned. By Amir Razavi CHAMPAGNE socialists leading the teachers’ strikes own houses worth a combined £3.6million. National Education Union joint general secretary Mary Bousted, 64, owns a Victorian townhouse in Southwark, South London, worth £1.5million. Comrade Kevin Courtney has a £2.1million Victorian terrace house in Stoke Newington, North East London. A union spokesman said: “Kevin Courtney and Mary Bousted could both afford to buy a house on their teacher’s salary in the 1980s. “This is now out of the reach of most young people.” Samantha Wilkinson, 30, of Ashington, Northumberland, said: “The teachers walked out and expected us to home-school the kids. “We did enough of that during the pandemic. The kids missed so much school, it isn’t fair on them. “Teachers are already well paid and now they’re demanding more. They’re taking the mick.” Becky Bohan, 43, of Hertfordshire, said the strike action caused one of her sons to have anxiety attacks.  She said: “I’m trying to juggle my life, my kids, my mental health and our financial situation in a bid to make ends meet.” The industrial action hit around 23,000 schools today, with some teachers bringing their children to join them on picket lines. Labour MPs also turned out. Tory MP and former teacher Jonathan Gullis said: “The last thing that any teacher should be doing is dragging their children as some sort of political handbag up and down picket lines.” The NEU said 40,000 school staff have signed up in recent weeks. The union wants better salaries to keep more teachers in post and help recruit more from university or back into the profession.  Meanwhile, former Tory Party chairman Jake Berry laughed at mandarins protesting in Whitehall. He scoffed: “I haven’t seen this many civil servants in Westminster since the start of the pandemic. “Just a shame they’ve only come in to stand on a picket line. Back to working from home tomorrow.” Border Agency staff at airports and ports were among 100,000 civil servants striking.  One at the Independent Office for Police Conduct described a two per cent pay offer as a “slap in the face”. The PM’s official spokesman said: “We want to have further talks with the unions. “We have to balance that against the need to be fair to all taxpayers, the majority of whom don't work for the public sector.” FORMER Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn supported strikers on their march through Westminster. And 13 Labour MPs, including Richard Burgon, Ian Lavery and Kate Osborne, defied boss Sir Keir Starmer to join pickets.

Rishi Sunak promises his law to stop migrants crossing Channel will be unveiled in weeks,"RISHI Sunak today promises his law to stop small boat crossings will be unveiled in weeks — as he hits 100 days in office. The PM reaches the landmark with a pledge that illegal migrants will be detained and deported instead of put up in 4-star hotels. And he said his agenda should not be judged on results now but before next year’s expected election. The PM will be interviewed by Piers Morgan on TalkTV when he is set to hit back at Labour claims his short tenure has been dogged by scandal and sleaze. After the turmoil of Boris Johnson’s ousting and the 49-day Liz Truss disaster, he will say matters have steadied. Writing in today’s Sun, he says the government has halted the economy’s freefall, slowed mortgage rate rises and boosted help for Ukraine with weapons, ammo and now heavy tanks — the first country in the world to do so. He adds: “In the coming weeks, our new stop the boats Bill will change the law to send a message loud and clear — if you come here illegally, you will be detained and removed. We’re doing whatever it takes to fix this.” Mr Sunak also insists that the government is halving inflation, growing the economy, cutting debt and waiting lists. He adds: “That’s what Sun Readers can judge me on in under 1,000 days when you decide who’ll lead the country for the next five years.” But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the PM’s first 100 days were marked by a pathetic failure to stop strikes. He told MPs: “The Tory Party’s addiction to sleaze and scandal has done huge damage to this country and the cost to the public keeps adding up.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21245257/rishi-sunak-small-boat-crossings-law/
I was diagnosed with incurable cancer after noticing something odd when I got drunk,"A YOUNG man has opened up about how he was diagnosed with an incurable cancer after noticing something odd when he was drunk.   Phil Dobson, 26, said he was battling to urinate while he was on a getaway in Scotland with his girlfriend Holly Nolan.  But, because he'd been ""drinking alcohol all day"", Phil put his struggles down to the booze in his system.  However, the Northumberland man was still unable to pass urine when he'd sobered up and returned home so raced to A&E.  Then, after countless tests, Phil was devastatingly told he had a rare, incurable cancer.  He said the issues first started in July, 2021, when he was just 24.  Phil said: ""On the second day of the trip, I started having trouble passing urine. ""I felt like I always needed a wee, but nothing was coming out. I thought nothing of it because I had been drinking alcohol throughout the day and I thought I might be bloated. ""But on the train on the way home, I was sweating badly and couldn’t sit still due to the pain in my bladder. ""As soon as we got home to Newcastle, I went straight to A&E."" Phil said he was initially told he had a UTI, and was given medication for that.  But, when the symptoms didn't improve he went back for more tests - and was again told nothing else was wrong.  Then, the following month, Phil went back to the doctor.  During the check-up a lump was found on his prostate, and he was rushed to hospital.  It was there that Phil was told he had a tumour.  He explained: ""The staff tried to get me to pass urine, but I couldn’t do it at all.  ""They put a catheter in me and drained my bladder. About two litres of urine was drained from me - a normal bladder should only hold around 500ml. ""I was in a lot of pain because my kidneys weren’t passing urine. They did a scan and discovered it was a tumour."" He was then told a rare type of cancer called Rhabdomyosarcoma.  Doctors have now told him it is incurable - Phil recalled: ""I was devastated. ""I had family in the past who had passed away after cancer. I was determined and hoped that youth would be on my side. ""Naturally, my family was devastated too. I was so healthy, did lots of exercise, and had no previous medical conditions."" I thought nothing of it because I had been drinking alcohol throughout the day. Since the diagnosis, Phil has been undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment at Freeman Hospital. He said: ""The consultant said told me that they think the tumour is incurable, but the maintenance chemo can control it and make sure it’s not coming back. ""I have decided to just live the best life I can. I moved in with my girlfriend earlier this year and we got a dog, which has kept me busy and has been a really great thing for me to look forward to. I also went back to work at BT in July."" Phil is now also working alongside Teenager Cancer Trust and joined the charity on its plight to raise awareness of the main signs of cancer in young people. He said their support had been unwavering throughout his illness.  Phil said: “Teenage Cancer Trust helped me so much. ""A teenage and young adult clinical nurse specialist on my unit explained what was going to happen to me when I was diagnosed with cancer. It was such a confusing time, but her support was amazing. ""It's difficult when you worry that you are wasting a GP's time, but if you know that something is wrong, don't hesitate to get it checked."" Dr Louise Soanes, chief nurse at the Teenage Cancer Trust, said the charity is calling on the Government to run a public awareness campaign for cancers experienced by young people. She said: ""It can be scary to think about cancer, particularly if you’re a young person, but it can happen to anyone of any age.  ""Always listen to your body and if you have concerns never be afraid to seek help – the likelihood is that it isn’t cancer, but it’s always best to check.” Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that grows in active muscles of the body. They are extremely rare - about 3,300 new cases are diagnosed each year in the UK. These are muscles we control (for example, to move arms or legs). The most common places for rhabdomyosarcoma are the head, neck, bladder, vagina, arms, legs and trunk of the body. Very rarely, rhabdomyosarcoma can also be found in other places, such as in the prostate gland, middle ear and bile duct system.

Tips to combat Blue Monday – the most depressing day of the year,"BLUE Monday is dubbed the saddest day of the year, with many expected to feel emotional after the holidays. In 2023, the day falls on January 16 - but don't worry, there are a number of ways to beat the blues. Blue Monday is calculated using a series of factors in a (not particularly scientific) mathematical formula. These are the weather, debt level, the amount of time since Christmas, time since failing our New Year's resolutions, low motivational levels, and the feeling of needing to take charge of the situation. It was originally conceived by a PR company in 2005 but has now become a widely recognised annual event. Mental health charity Mind is derisive of the notion of Blue Monday, claiming the concept has no foundation in scientific research. A statement on their website says: ""Here at Mind, we think it’s dangerously misleading. ""Those of us who live with depression know that those feelings aren’t dictated by the date. ""Implying that they are perpetuates the myth that depression is just 'feeling a bit down', something that doesn’t need to be taken seriously."" The Samaritans are also against the idea that one particular day is deemed the saddest of the year. In a bid to deter away from Blue Monday, the mental health charity has coined a new term - 'Brew Monday'. On Brew Monday, individuals are encouraged to reach out to others over a cuppa and offer support, a listening ear, and someone there when needed. Like Brew Monday, there are a number of ways to beat the blues and boost your mind. Here's a look at just some of the things you can do. First and foremost, it is important to remember that you are in control. Blue Monday was determined by a PR firm and many companies play into the theme of January being a depressing month. Keep reminding yourself that you have the power to change how you feel. Take advantage of the sunshine, if you can. Go for a walk on your lunch break or try a new outdoor activity to boost your vitamin D levels. Even just a short 15-minute burst could have a real impact. Another way you can combat Blue Monday is to do some exercise. Whether it is going for a run or taking a class at a gym, moving your body releases endorphins and can help boost your mood. Personal trainer Andy Ward advises that exercise is a great tonic for feeling down, and it's best to avoid binge-eating and shunning your mates. He said: ""Squeeze in 30 minutes of exercise. It could be a fast walk, a light jog, a relaxing swim, or an intense HIIT class - just move for thirty minutes to feel the benefits. ""There are dozens of different fitness classes available. January is a great time to take up new hobbies and meet new people."" While it is easy for people to recommend fitness for making yourself feel good, sometimes that's the last thing you want to do. Instead, why not try watching a feel-good film to make you smile. Pick one of your favourites, or a classic you have never seen, and sit back and relax. If you're not one for watching films or television, why not pick up a self-care book. These particular books are aimed at improving mental health and providing tips on how to manage anxiety, reduce stress, and feel happier and more at peace. Alternatively, you can pick up your phone, laptop, or tablet and tune in to a self-care podcast. There are a number of listening materials aimed at improving and managing your mental health. Finally, connect with people around you. This could be giving to others in whatever way you feel - whether it's a smile, a ""thank you"", or a kind word. However, if you are struggling with feelings of depression over a long period, you should speak to your doctor, or a trusted family member or friend. If you, or anyone you know, needs help dealing with mental health problems the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or visit Mind’s website.

How much do junior doctors earn? UK salary explained,"JUNIOR doctors are set to vote on whether or not they should take strike action in a dispute over pay. But how much do junior doctors earn and how can you become one? This is what we know. The pay received by junior doctors is dependent on experience. During foundation training, doctors will earn a basic salary of between £29,384 to £34,012 per year.  A doctor beginning their specialist training will earn between £40,257 to £53,398 a year.  Junior doctors are voting on January 9, 2023, over whether they should take strike action. If they vote in favour of taking action, the strikes will take place in March 2023 over a 72 hour period.  If this happens, it will be the first industrial action taken by doctors since 2016, where four periods of action led to around 300,000 appointment and operation cancellations.  Junior doctors will not provide emergency medical care across England if this is voted in. Around 45,000 members of the British medical association (BMA) are being balloted, with the results set for the end of February.  The current pay agreement for junior doctors ends in March 2023. The government says increasing pay in line with inflation is unaffordable. The BMA have urged the health secretary, Steve Barclay, to meet with the organisation in order to negotiate a deal to avoid strike action. The BMA said junior doctors in England have seen a real-term pay cut over the past 15 years, which amounts to a 26.1% decline in pay since the tax year 2008/09. A junior doctor is a qualified doctor in clinical training. They work under the supervision of a senior doctor. The first step for any person wanting to become a doctor is to  study medicine at undergraduate level. After completing their studies in medicine, they then move on to two years of integrated training. These are known as foundation year one and foundation year two. To practice as a doctor in the UK, you must have completed the two year programme of general training. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/20981675/how-much-junior-doctors-earn-uk/
How to tell if you’re dehydrated amid fears millions of Brits aren’t drinking enough water,"THIS is how to tell whether you're dehydrated or not amid fears millions of Brits aren't drinking enough water. On average, a person only drinks about four glasses of water a day, according to research. A study of 2,000 adults revealed they typically drink less than the recommended daily amount of two litres.  Most people hydrate using tea and coffee instead with 44 per cent choosing the hot drink.   However 64 per cent are aware they should drink more water with 49 per cent claiming they often forget. The research found four in 10 weren't sure how much they drink in a typical day. It also discovered residents in Liverpool drink the least water, followed by Manchester and Leeds. The research was commissioned by Volvic Touch of Fruit and found 24 per cent are just too busy to fit regular sips into their schedule. Gemma Morgan, a spokesperson for Volvic, said: ""We’re seeing a nation struggling to stay hydrated despite knowing how crucial it is to maintain a healthy, balanced lifestyle."" The research also found for 60 per cent, hydration is important to more than their physical health, as they agree they feel happier and healthier when they've drank enough. In order to spot dehydration, 44 per cent recognise the dark colour of their urine as a tell-tale sign that they need to drink more. This is followed by a dry mouth, headaches, and dry lips as the key signs that another glass of water might be in order. For the new year, 28 per cent of adults have vowed to stay more hydrated. Flavoured water is a favourite for 22 per cent, and 41 per cent have tried flavouring their own beverages as a way to convince themselves to drink more. The study, carried out via OnePoll, also found 26 per cent would drink more water if it tasted better. Gemma Morgan added: ""We want people to know that drinking enough water is not only essential but can be done in a fun and delicious way, and we hope to help people achieve their goals."" Following the findings, Made in Chelsea star Sophie Habboo has teamed up with Volvic Touch of Fruit to offer hydration hacks. 1. Liverpool    2. Manchester    3. Leeds   4. Worcester    5. Leicester    6. Glasgow    7. Coventry    8. Birmingham    9. Newcastle    10. Chelmsford ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/20975246/millions-brits-arent-drinking-water/
Rishi Sunak summons NHS bosses for crisis talks as worst ever figures for ambulance handovers of sick patients revealed,"RISHI Sunak has summoned NHS chiefs for crisis talks today amid the worst ever waits for ambulance patients to be handed to A&E. The PM called a rare Saturday summit to thrash out easing strains on the buckling NHS. Several hospitals have declared critical incidents. Ambulances, A&Es and wards have become swamped, increasing wait times. Meanwhile, patients braced for more chaos last night as Unite said ambulance crews will strike on January 23. Last week 5,105 flu patients were in hospital beds — up 47 per cent on the week before. Covid cases have also jumped. Ambulance handover delay reached a new high last week as one in four patients waited more than an hour to be given to emergency units, compared to ten per cent a year ago. Four in ten waited at least half an hour, up from 23 per cent on 12 months ago. The delays reveal the ongoing battle facing medics as they fight for space for those arriving at hospital.  An average of 12,809 beds were filled with patients who were ready to leave, up nearly a third on this time last year. Tomorrow's Downing Street meeting will be attended by Health Secretary Steve Barclay, Treasury minister John Glen, Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden and NHS England boss Amanda Pritchard. The NHS Confederation said medics were working in “crisis conditions with inherent risks to patient safety”. Tomorrow's NHS Recovery Forum will discuss ideas to solve the delays in patients being discharged and other problems with emergency care. Mr Sunak has admitted the NHS is under “enormous pressure” but said it is a priority. Workers hoping for big wage bumps at the next public sector pay review are set to be disappointed as ministers warned that would simply spike inflation The Treasury's evidence sent to the independent boards for the 2023/24 settlement also showed private sector pay is only set to rise 3.5 per cent on average next year.  Projected private sector pay is usually the best indication of what the typical public sector worker will be awarded, with a Government source saying ""it's about fairness"".  The Government's guidance also warned: ""Higher pay awards could risk higher and more persistent inflation.  ""This would in turn reduce real incomes and could push interest rates up even further, increasing borrowing costs for households and government, wiping out the limited headroom against the government’s fiscal rules, and potentially burdening future generations with higher debt.""

What are the January blues and how should you deal with them?,"WITH the festive period over and a long year ahead, many of us can be forgiven for feeling down at the start of 2023. The excesses of Christmas leave a sobering hangover this time of year, it is a common feeling, but there are ways to get rid of those January blues. Everyone goes into the New Year full of promise and best intentions. Aside from social media promises you made on New Year's Eve, it is very easy to slip into a negative mindset at this time of year. The mornings are dark and the evenings come at you thick and fast, you seem to be spending all of your time inside. It is believed that every year in January one day sees the perfect storm of factors contribute towards ""Blue Monday"". In 2023, that day falls on Monday, January 16, when post-Christmas blues merge with the cold dark nights and meet up with all the unpaid bills from the previous month.
 The January blues differ somewhat to seasonal affective disorder (SAD). One thing to know is that most of us suffer from feeling down at certain times, you are not any different, but if you do find the January blues starting to affect all areas of your life you could be suffering from SAD. Most scientists believe that the problem is related to the way the body responds to daylight. Alison Kerry from mental health charity MIND says ""with SAD, one theory is that light entering the eye causes changes in hormone levels in the body"". She added: ""In our bodies, light functions to stop the production of the sleep hormone melatonin, making us wake up. “It’s thought that SAD sufferers are affected by shorter daylight hours in the winter. They produce higher melatonin, causing lethargy and symptoms of depression."" The easiest thing to do in these situations is to feel that you are the only person feeling this way and isolate yourself further, but it is important to know this is a just a common human trait. It is something we should feel comfortable in talking about, admitting to and helping each other out when we feel those January blues taking grip. Should you feel the need to talk to somebody, The Samaritans offer an ear and advice. Although the January blues aren't considered a mental health disorder and don't interfere with daily functioning, you might: It is normal to start to feel sluggish after the over-indulgence over Christmas and New Year, allowing yourself to spiral as the year doesn't get off to the start you had hoped for. When you start to feel in a rut and not wanting to leave the house, it can be easy to see no way out of this mindset.       ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8218772/what-january-blues-how-know-suffering-deal/
How long can you keep leftover turkey in the fridge or freezer?,"IT is traditional at Christmas for people to cook a large festive roast for their family to enjoy together. For food that is left over, is it safe to reuse in the days following or is it a health risk? Here's what we know. If you're buying your meat in advance, you can keep raw turkey in the fridge for one to two days, according to the UK Food Safety guidelines. After you've finished eating it, cool the meat at room temperature as soon as possible. Once cool, cover it and put in the fridge (or freezer) - but make sure it's away from raw meat. Cooked turkey is safe in the fridge for up to three to four days, so you can get creative with some recipes over the next few days. Remember, if you're heating up the leftover turkey, ensure it is piping hot throughout. It should reach a temperature of 75°C or above. Do not reheat meat more than once. If it's in the freezer, it is safe for up to two to six months, but make sure you fully defrost it before using it. Leftover turkey can be made into a pie, by mixing it with ham, adding it to some ready-made puff pastry, and baked in the oven - it's comfort food at its finest. You can also mix it with leftover mash, Brussels sprouts, parsnips, gravy and make some bubble and squeak. If you fancy something a little lighter, you could try making it into a salad - just add plenty of mint and feta, and any other fresh veggies you like. You could also treat yourself to a turkey curry. Or, use it in pitta or flat bread by adding feta and pomegranate seeds or hummus and spices - but you can be creative with anything you fancy.

What was the Great Plague of London and how did it end?,"DURING the 17th century the worst outbreak of plague since the Black Death of 1348 tore its way through London. Thousands were estimated to have perished during the outbreak, but what was the plague? How did it end? Here's all you need to know. In 1665 The Great Plague of London struck the city. It is known by a few names, the Black Death and the Great Mortality. In the 17th century, the plague was sweeping across Europe, endemic mostly in the congested major cities. But this outbreak was of a proportion far greater than had been seen for some time. The plague had been known to England for centuries since it first wrecked society in 1348. The World Health Organisation describes plague symptoms as ""flu-like"", with one to seven days between incubation and the symptoms emerging. Victims suffered terribly. Their skin turned black in patches, glands became inflamed or 'buboes' in the groin. This was combined with uncontrollable vomiting, tongue swelling, and headaches. Altogether, an agonising way to die. Plague is an infectious disease caused by the Yersinia Pestis bacteria usually found in small mammals and their fleas. It has an extremely high fatality rate and is very infectious, although it can be treated by antibiotics if it's caught early. Depending on what area of the body is involved, the plague has three main types: Bubonic plague is fatal in 30%-60% of cases, while the pneumonic kind is always fatal if left untreated. This was not the first time the plague hit London, in 1625 40,000 Londoners died from it, but the 1665 outbreak was the worst and last epidemic of its kind in London. How the Great Plague of London started remains a mystery. It is thought most likely to have come across on a Dutch ship. Black rats carried the fleas that caused the plague. They were attracted by city streets filled with rubbish and waste, especially in the poorest areas. At the time this was not known and would not be known for centuries. Those that lived in the poorer, crowded areas of London were at higher risk of contracting the plague as rats were more present in these areas. The plague began in the London suburb St Giles in the fields and the worst effects stayed in the city's outskirts at Stepney, Shoreditch, Clerkenwell, Cripplegate, and Westminster. Millions of people across Europe died of the plague since its first outbreak from 1347 to 1351, aptly named the Black Death. The second wave in the 1500s saw the emergence of a new strain, once again bringing nations to their knees with high death tolls. The last plague pandemic hit Asia at the end of the 1800s, giving the scientific and medical communities the opportunity to identify and study the disease. During the Great Plague of London, it was recorded that an estimated 68,596 people died although it is believed that more than 100,000 people perished out of a population of 460,000. At its height, the disease was claiming 7,000 lives a week, according to conservative measurements It was believed that there was an outbreak during the winter of 1664, however, it did not spread like wildfire until the spring of 1665. Those who could, including lawyers, doctors, and nobility, abandoned the city for their own safety King Charles II and his court fled the city in the summer of 1665 and did not return until February 1666. Parliament also relocated out of the city to Oxford during the worst of the epidemic. London was struck by a second tragedy in 1666, The Great Fire of London. Some believed that the fire is what brought about the end of the plague, but others argue that the plague had already started to wane before the fire destroyed most of the city. Over 13,000 homes were destroyed, along with almost 90 churches and even St Paul's Cathedral was damaged by the blaze. The fire started in September in the King's bakery on Pudding Lane. Fires at the time were common and usually easily stopped. However, the summer was a hot one, so the wooden buildings were tinder dry. Strong winds also helped the fire to spread with devastating effects.   ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4773025/great-plague-of-london-how-many-killed-bubonic-plague-caused/
Inside NHS hospital which treats more patients than before Covid & has no backlog despite 7.2m on waiting lists,"IT felt like a war zone during the pandemic as doctors and nurses battled to save the sick and dying being rushed in for treatment in what was once a Covid hotspot. Hospitals around the country are still feeling the strain, and new figures released this week have shown that by October there were 7.2million people waiting for surgery. And on Thursday, the nurses’ strike could see up to 15,000 operations cancelled when 100,000 nurses are expected to take action at 76 hospitals and NHS organisations. But one hospital has bucked the trend. Croydon University Hospital in South London has no backlog and now carries out 300 operations a week, an 11 per cent rise on the 270 it conducted before the pandemic. A major restructuring at the height of Covid, which created a hospital within a hospital, was such a success that they have kept it even after the pandemic. When The Sun on Sunday visited this week, one patient, mum-of-four Lilian Abemere, 41, described it as a “five-star hospital”. She said: “I imagine it’s similar to going private. Even the food is good. The treatment and the attention I’ve been given here is something I never expected.” Staff there have cared for more than 30,000 patients needing surgery since July 2020.  This includes more than 3,000 referred by neighbouring hospitals to reduce waits for planned care or treatment. The hospital is in the top five Trusts nationally for referral to treatment times, as of September. In line with NHS expected standards, the vast majority of patients — 80.6 per cent — are seen within 18 weeks. And Croydon has no patients waiting longer than 78 weeks for treatment, while around the country a wait can be more than two years. Their staff will not join the nurses going on strike over pay across the country later this month. Senior surgeon Stella Vig told us: “Covid has been awful, but it has given us opportunities in that we are just so much more efficient now. I would never go back to the way it was before.” The pandemic caused paralysis in the health service, with more Covid patients flooding into hospitals than staff could cope with. Operations including life-saving cancer treatments were cancelled or delayed. And the backlog is still having a knock-on effect, with the number on the NHS waiting list leaping by 100,000 in the past month alone. Croydon was able to return to normal by the main building, on a 19-acre site in Thornton Heath, being split in two.  This created a separation between the theatres, or operating rooms, used for elective, pre-planned surgeries from those used for everything else. The upper floor became a hospital within a hospital, with staff and patients rigorously tested for Covid — undergoing PCR tests and having their temperature checked — before they were allowed inside. Only 20 patients have tested positive for Covid in the restricted access hospital since July 2020. NHS executives visited in August to see if the new model can be rolled out across the UK and PM Rishi Sunak spoke to staff in October. He later told The Sun on Sunday: “Tackling the NHS Covid backlog is one of my top priorities and last month I saw first-hand how Croydon Hospital are leading the way . . . I want their success to be a blueprint for the entire NHS.”  Stella said: “As a surgeon, I can come in and get on with my job. I would never go back to the way it was.  “I used to start my theatre list and there are no beds. I would go downstairs, do a ward run of my patients and find two that I could persuade to go home so I could start my theatre list upstairs. “Then I would start my list late and everyone would have to work until late, around 7.30pm, so we could finish. And that’s not easy when you have childcare to pay for. “As you walk down the corridor now, you see how peaceful and calm it is because this is the elective centre and you only come in if you are having an operation.”  Stella admits the height of Covid was terrifying.  She told us: “In March 2020, almost two thirds of our beds were filled with Covid patients.  “The Intensive Care Unit was overwhelmed. It was harrowing. We were worrying about getting Covid or our friends and family getting it. “Colleagues moved out of home because they had vulnerable relatives and stayed in a hotel across the road for three months. “I remember one night leaving work and seeing people out clapping for the first time. I cried all the way home. “But we had people that had not been able to have vital surgery for six months, so we needed to crack on.  “At first, we came up with lots of harebrained ideas that never would have worked.  “The original conversation was to have a surgery hub in a different hospital. But a lot of people in Croydon can’t afford to travel. “So we decided to put in a new door and create a separate hospital on the second floor, with strict protocols about testing. “Within eight weeks we were back to doing what we are used to doing, while the rest of the country was at a standstill.  “We got permission to restructure at the end of May 2020 and in July we were live. “With the reconfiguration, we’ve now got four emergency centre theatres downstairs.  “We only have nine theatres for elective surgery now, two fewer than before, but we are performing more operations, which is a credit to this team.” Clinical lead practitioner Jijeesh Marotikunnath added: “The hospital felt like a war zone during the pandemic. Death became common and people were panicking.” “One day we would be treating a patient and the next they would die — and we didn’t understand why they were dying so fast. “There was a two-million waiting list across the country that kept going up. We were a Covid hotspot as Croydon had so many cases, but we knew we had to clear the backlog.”  The scene today is remarkably different and a Sun on Sunday reporter saw the tranquil atmosphere across the clean wards of the restricted access zone. As Covid numbers subside and testing rules are eased, there are no plans to go back to the old system. Senior nurse Talitha McDonald is one of those who will not be striking.  She said: Our staff will come in during the rail and bus strikes, if they have to walk they will walk to work. During the pandemic it was the same. “You want to look after patients and do your best. That’s what you sign up for, to look after people.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/20715632/inside-nhs-hospital-no-backlog-more-patients-after-covid/

Health Sec begs militant unions for talks to avoid crippling winter nurses strikes,"THE HEALTH Secretary last night begged militant union bosses to come back for talks to avoid devastating nurses strikes this winter. Steve Barclay revealed union bosses had declined his offers for a final meeting before announcing their first ever national walkout. And he slammed chiefs for their no-show to crunch discussions with NHS chiefs over strike exemptions last week in a bid to avoid huge shortages as the winter pressures hits. The Health Secretary promised “my door is open” for further discussions in a letter to Pat Cullen, boss of the Royal College of Nursing. But he insisted ministers could not accept their demands for a staggering 19 per cent pay rise in light of the “challenging economic circumstances facing our country.” In a letter to them he praised hard-working NHS staff and said he was “disappointed” they had chosen this “unprecedented step” of dramatic strike action. Mr Barclay wrote: “I must express my deep regret that you have declined my offer of a meeting and have instead taken the decision to proceed with announcing strike dates without further discussion. “I urge you to reconsider your position and come back to the table. “I, my colleagues across Government, and indeed the public, value the care provided by nurses up and down this country and I am disappointed that you have taken this unprecedented step.” Nurses in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will walk out for two days next month in what is expected to be their biggest strike in history. Routine services will be hit on December 15 and 20 as they stage action over pay and patient safety. It came as union chief Mick Lynch hailed the news that train cleaners will join mass strikes action too. RMT chiefs said more than 1,000 workers backed industrial action – demanding higher pay and bigger pensions. Rail bosses were ready to ready to offer up an eight per cent pay hike in a bid to end the ongoing stalemate, The Sun on Sunday understands. But ministers were last night said to have vetoed the package. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/health-news/20561457/strike-deal-nurses-health-secretary/
Scientists successfully graft human brain cells into rats in a bid to better grasp conditions such as epilepsy,"SCIENTISTS have successfully grafted human brain cells into rats — a move that could help to better understand conditions such as epilepsy.  Lab-grown nerves were implanted in rats two or three days old.  Unlike past attempts in adult rats, the cells were absorbed quickly and made up a third of the brain after six months, becoming part of rats’ decision-making and physical reactions.  The mutant organs will allow brains to be studied in more detail than using cells in a dish. Lead author Prof Sergiu Paca of Stanford University, US, said: “These findings may improve our ability to produce realistic models of human diseases.”  Austrian expert Dr Jürgen Knoblich added: “The human brain is home to some of the most horrific diseases and we don’t understand it very well. “These findings could have an impact on research into neurological diseases such as epilepsy, or autism.” The trial did not allow the creatures to think like people and experts warn scientists must be careful not to give lab rats human thoughts or feelings.

I’m furious my son’s school said he must attend even if he has a serious illness – they threatened to report me,"A MUM was left furious after her son's school said he must attend even if he has a serious illness and threatened to report her. An email from the school reportedly claims that parents should send in children even if they are suffering from tonsillitis or glandular fever. Gem, posting on Twitter, uploaded an image with the caption: “Absolutely disgusted to receive this in an email from my son's school after he had a couple of days off sick.” The shocking email is titled “when should your child stay at home?” and is followed by a number of explanations. It reads: “When assessing whether to send your child to school or not, consider whether an adult would take a day off from work in a similar situation. “For sickness or diarrhoea, the school's policy is for a child to be off for 48 hours. “You do not need to keep your child home from school if they have: athlete's foot, cold sores, glandular fever, head lice, tonsillitis, cold or cough, head aches, sore throat. “If we believe your child is absent without genuine reason, or they are frequently with illness, we may request medical evidence or discuss the child with the local authority.” Unsurprisingly, the post cooked up a storm on social media with many pointing out how the advice went against NHS guidelines. Readers were understandably fuming considering that a number of these conditions are easily contagious not to mention very serious. One Twitter user replying to Gem wrote: “Jesus Christ. honestly sending your kid to school with tonsillitis or glandular fever is just… abusive? “They would have a fever! They’re contagious! They’d feel APPALLING. No work will get done! “You’re meant to rest when you’re sick! I’d be sending some furious words in response.” A second  posted: “No one should be at school or work with Glandular fever. Also things like coughs, colds, etc can spread infections to other child(ren), same with head lice."" According to the NHS glandular fever can make you feel very ill and lasts for week. It is spread through spit, so you can get it through kissing or by sharing cups or cutlery.  Those who have it can be infectious for up to 7 weeks before getting symptoms. Likewise, being sent to school with tonsillitis is also against NHS advice. The advice adds that while tonsillitis is not contagious, the infections that cause it – such as colds and flu – are. Taking into account that someone with tonsillitis would be in a lot of pain and ""should get plenty of rest"" only makes the school's advice even more baffling.  While colds and coughs are not the worst thing in the world, they could easily be a sign of far worse infections. As for other illnesses on the list, head lice is spread by head-to-head contact and athlete's foot can easily be spread in a swimming pool. However, according to the NHS advice students can attend school with these conditions. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19976637/furious-sons-school-attend-serious-illness-threatened-report/
I paid £200 for a huge leg tattoo but I was left in hospital unable to walk after it went badly wrong,"A MUM who paid £200 for a huge leg tattoo was left in hospital unable to walk after it went badly wrong. Shyann Johanneson, 26, got her right thigh tattooed with a design featuring an eye, clock, compass and rose back in April last year. But despite the artist having previously doing a number of other tattoos for her - this one did not go to plan. Mum-of-four Shyann says that within hours she was in agony and struggling to walk before her leg began to ""ooze"" and smell like ""rotting flesh"". The artist allegedly blamed her use of numbing cream but Shyann claims doctors said the ink had been pushed too deeply into her skin, causing the infection. The infection, which was most severe in darker inked areas, then developed into sepsis - leaving her at risk of needing a skin graft. Sepsis happens when your immune system overreacts to an infection and starts to damage your body's tissue and organs. Thankfully for Shyann the wound healed after a gruelling three-month recovery period and she has now shared horrifying photos of her ordeal. Shyann, from West Yorkshire, said: ""When the tattoo was first finished it looked absolutely beautiful, it was one of my best tattoos, I was so happy with it. ""I've given birth to four kids without pain relief, I'm stubborn with pain but within 12 hours the pain was that intense I couldn't even walk, it was so bad."" Shyann added that within four hours she was laid up in bed ""in agony"" and described it as ""the worst experience of my life"". She continued: ""He butchered my leg. It was literally just oozing and rotting, it even smelled like rotting flesh. It got to the point where I was so poorly I felt like I was going to die."" And she claims that the plastic surgeon said the tattoo artist ""had gone way too deep into my skin"", causing sepsis. Shyann added that if she hadn't been so reactive seeking out medical help she doesn't believe she would've kept her leg. The mum was prescribed antibiotics and pain relief for the ""oozing"" wound after visiting her doctor the day after her tatt. When the pain continued to increase a day later she went to St James's University Hospital, in Leeds, where she alleges doctors confirmed she had sepsis. Shyann was given IV antibiotics to fight the infection and says she began to feel better over the next 48 hours. But she had to return to the hospital for dressing changes every three days as doctors warned that she may need a skin graft. After two months of check-ups, her leg showed signs of improvement and she was discharged with supplies to dress and clean the wound herself before it fully healed a few weeks later. She also claims the tattoo artist told her ""for weeks"" he was going to repay her before blocking her out of the blue. The mum-of-four added: ""After months of him chasing him down the solicitor emailed me and said 'there's nothing we can do because the guy is not even registered as a tattooist and he doesn't hold insurance'. ""He said on social media that he was a qualified tattooist. You don't really think to question it when someone says 'I've passed XYZ' and his tattoos are good as well."" However, despite acknowledging she broke tattoo aftercare advice, Shyann argues that the inking ""was already infected"". Shyann said: ""I've had loads of tattoos before where I've jumped in the bath that night to get rid of the blood and ink and every other tattoo has been fine. ""But this one there way no way I could even put it under the water, never mind wash it, because it was so painful."" The student now hopes to warn other tattoo enthusiasts to carefully research artists and ask for proof after being left with bad scarring. Shyann said: ""My skin is literally paper thin to the point where it's a year-and-a-half later and I'm still too scared to get it touched up. ""Make sure before you get tattooed that you've seen their insurance and qualifications because it can go really wrong. In my case it did."" The tattoo artist was repeatedly contacted for comment but failed to respond.

Brits worried by long NHS waiting times and staff shortages as winter looms,"BRITS are growing increasingly concerned by long NHS waiting times and workforce shortages, according to new research. Experts at the Health Foundation revealed the public’s top priorities for the NHS are improving waiting times for routine services and increasing staff numbers. The report - based on a poll of over 2,000 people - also found Brits are deeply concerned about the impacts of rising costs of living on the nation’s health, with 57% believing rising living costs are a high threat to the health of UK citizens. A further 72% believe overall health and wellbeing has declined across the UK in the past 12 months.  That said, the stats show the public overwhelmingly supports the NHS, with 77% of those polled believing it is 'crucial to British society.' The research comes after PM Liz Truss promised to “make sure that people can get doctors appointments and the NHS services they need."" She added: “We will put our health service on a firm footing by delivering on the economy, on energy and on the NHS.” Hugh Alderwick, Director of Policy at the Health Foundation, said:  “It’s clear the UK public want a health service with enough staff to deliver the care they need. “Staffing shortages are severely affecting what the health system can deliver and the public are taking notice and want additional investment to improve the situation. “When people are overwhelmingly worried about the rising costs of living - and people are choosing between heating and eating - their health will suffer. Without immediate action, there is a risk the cost-of-living crisis becomes a health crisis.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19735324/brits-worried-long-nhs-waiting-times-and-staff-shortages/
What to do if you are stung by a jellyfish – and it definitely DOESN’T involve urine,"COULD we be more wrong? Millions still mistakenly believe that when you are stung by a jellyfish you should wee on the welt. They have been fooled by 1990s sitcom Friends in which Chandler pees on Monica’s leg when she is stung. Three in ten in the UK would urinate on themselves — and one in five misguided Brits would ask a friend or partner to shower them with home-made pain relief, a poll shows.  However, experts say splashing a jellyfish sting with urine is as brainless as the creatures themelves. Jack Willans, from the Sea Life London Aquarium, which commissioned the poll, said: “It’s true what they say, you shouldn’t believe everything you see on the TV. “Peeing on a jellyfish sting is the ultimate fake news — Chandler, Monica and Joey certainly have a lot to answer for. “We advise the public to steer clear of bodily fluids if unfortunate enough to get stung and follow some simple steps which don’t involve using urine.” Unlucky swimmers should instead rinse it in the salty sea, use a stick to remove any tentacles then soak it in warm water. Jellyfish sightings are common during summer in the UK as seas are warmer.  Extra daylight also means more plankton for the floating predators to eat.  Species lurking in British waters are not dangerous but their stings can pack a painful punch.  Jack added: “There have been a series of sightings this summer resulting in people being stung.” The poll found those in the East of England were most likely to believe the weeing myth, at 37 per cent. Those in the North West were least likely, at 24 per cent.     ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19681902/what-to-do-stung-by-jellyfish/

"Let’s give Jabs Army another big push and volunteer on hospital wards, says West End legend Elaine Paige","THE Sun’s brilliant Jabs Army volunteers are needed again . . . and this time we’d like you to get on your trolleys. Hospitals all over the country are desperately short of people to wheel refreshments around the wards. When Covid struck, the Royal Voluntary Service had to axe the service, which sell papers, magazines and toiletries to hospital patients. Now the pandemic is over, more than 600 volunteers are desperately needed around the UK. West End legend Elaine Paige is backing the Big Trolley Push for more volunteers on the wards. Elaine was photographed taking a trolley around wards at Leicester General Hospital with Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, the President of the RVS. Elaine says: “Having been behind a hospital trolley myself and seeing how the warm-hearted volunteers can raise patients’ spirits, I can only imagine how much they have been missed on wards over the past two years. “Now trolley services are back, I am urging people to see for themselves what a remarkable difference they can make to the wellbeing of someone who is likely experiencing a difficult time. “Donating your time to support others is a wonderful thing.  ""You don’t need any special skills and you certainly don’t need to sing to patients — as I did! Your time and compassion are enough to brighten someone’s day.” Big-hearted Jill Hickman, 75, has been pushing the trolley around Frimley Park Hospital, Surrey, since 1982. She was devastated when she was forced to give up when the first lockdown began in early 2020.  Jill says: “That Monday night when they phoned and I realised we couldn’t do it I was so upset. It was awful. I cried myself to sleep.” Jill was finally allowed back volunteering on the wards eight weeks ago. She says: “It was amazing to be back. Because I had been there for so many years it was like seeing old friends again. “RVS volunteers have a tremendous effect on the staff and the patients who enjoy having a little bit of the outside world coming to see them.” Part-time accountant John Stephens, 71, of Yately, Hants, volunteers with Jill for four hours a week. He says: “We visit 21 wards and it is really enjoyable work. The patients look forward to having a chat.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19552707/jabs-army-big-push-volunteer-hospital-wards-elaine-paige/
I’m a professional party girl and I’ve got an unbeatable hangover cure,"A PROFESSIONAL party girl has revealed her secret to surviving heavy boozing sessions and claims she has an unbeatable hangover cure. Danielle Walsh, 34, says her role as an events rep coupled with her years of drinking experience make her an expert on banishing the aftereffects of alcohol. She is paid to be the life and soul of the party at stag and hen dos in Northern Ireland - and downs drinks in the process.  The 34-year-old was scouted by a bar manager who spotted one of her impressive viral videos guzzling cocktails in just seconds.  Now Danielle is tasked with giving punters ""the best night out of their lives"" as a hostess in a popular bar on her home turf.  But constant nights out have a way of catching up on even the toughest boozers - so she formulated the perfect remedy to sort out her sore head. The care worker, who moonlights as a party animal, claims the solution to healing your hangover only requires some basic items. Danielle told the Daily Star: ""You cannot dwell on it. You need to get up and get out and make sure your house is clean beforehand.  ""Every Sunday I am prepared with a multipack of pickled onion Walkers crisps and Diet Coke. Honestly, it works wonders."" She insists her trusty snacks are all she relies on for ensuring she can get back out on the town the next night.  The merrymaker and mum-of-one manages to squeeze her fun-filled job in around her 9-5 work week schedule, as she isn't waylaid by a crippling hangover. And she needs all the energy she can get for the evening - as after some welcome drinks, Danielle hops on a party bike with partygoers for a non-stop boozing session. She then returns with her soon-to-be spouses for a string of raunchy activities, such as willy workshops, cocktail classes and strippers. The mum continued: ""I do it because I love it. I don't get paid more than anyone else on the team. ""Think Ibiza weekender but in Belfast. I take tourists from all over the world.   ""I'm a party animal and love a night out so to get paid to party is an absolute dream for me. ""I can let my hair down and burn off steam – while earning money – it's a win-win. My care colleagues absolutely love it and think it's hilarious."" Brits have long been in search of a hangover fix that really works. The NHS recommends that both men and women should not rink more than 14 units of alcohol a week. This equates to six small glasses of wine, six pints of lager or five pints of cider. Celebs aren't immune to the effects of partying either - seeing them share their secrets to feeling better in the morning.  Footie ace David Beckham swears by an Alka-Seltzer tablet before bed and then a bacon sarnie in the morning, explaining: “My grandad told me to do that.” And GOOP wellness guru Gwyneth Paltrow promises switching between hot and cold water in the shower will liven you up. Pharmaceutical giants have been keen to cash in on drinkers' desperation to get rid of hangovers too.  A new pill has entered the market claiming to put an end to your self-inflicted struggle, leaving you feeling refreshed the following day. Myrkl is a new supplement that you can take before you drink which claims to prevent hangovers. Participants in a clinical trial who drank two glasses of wine and took the supplement before drinking had on average 50 per cent less alcohol in their blood after 30 minutes. After 60 minutes, they had 70 per cent less, significantly reducing alcohol’s impact on the body. However, Dr Deborah Lee of Dr Fox Online Pharmacy told The Sun it is ""not so much ‘a hangover cure’, as ‘a stopping you get drunk in the first place’ remedy.""

Inside bizarre TikTok trend that sees young men getting VASECTOMIES on camera as cases rocket across the US,"AS America grapples with a crackdown on abortion and a looming financial crisis, more young men are turning to vasectomies - and filming it for TikTok. Demand for vasectomies appears to have shot up dramatically in every corner of the US since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in July, which guaranteed a woman the right to an abortion. For most people, getting ""the snip"" is a decision you make in later life. It refers to male sterilisation and it cuts or seals the tubes that carry a man's sperm to permanently prevent pregnancy. Many men go for this option when they don't want any more kids - as it's 99 per cent effective. But an increasingly turbulent post-Covid economy and a clampdown on women's rights means a growing number of young men are turning to clinics for different reasons – and sharing their experience on TikTok. TikTok videos with the hashtag #vasectomy have been viewed more than 500 million times, and the hashtag #snipsniphooray viewed more than 20 million times.  As well as men filming themselves having the op, videos from the last few months show women making thoughtful care packages for their partners while they recover. Even on Tinder, mentions of “vasectomy” in dating profiles surged this year by more than five times compared to last year, a spokeswoman for the dating platform told The New York Times. And demand for the procedure itself has skyrocketed, particularly in the US, with many medical staff overwhelmed and unprepared for the level of interest. A doctor in Iowa who normally carries out 40 to 50 vasectomies each month was on track to do 100 in July after the Roe v. Wade decision. Dr Charles Monteith, medical director of a clinic in North Carolina, told Vice News: “I'm normally scheduled out for two to four weeks. Now, I’m scheduled out for three months. “We have seen a dramatic increase in inquiries and contacts through our website and calls."" In Alabama and Texas - two states that have brought in draconian abortion laws since the Supreme Court ruling - medics said there has been a “crazy” rise in vasectomy appointments and weekly calls have doubled. Tim McAuliff, a Texas-based vasectomist, said: ""We’ve had some people call and say because of Roe v. Wade they want to be more proactive or preventative."" And it's not just happening in states where new abortion laws have been introduced - doctors in New York said business has tripled since July. Men without children are also enquiring about vasectomies as a method of contraception in the post-Roe world, while others are having the snip as more and more people make a conscious decision not to have kids. With just one child, Keith Laue, 23, made the decision to have ""the snip"". He and his partner Taylor Ribar said they felt disempowered by laws which were being bought in, in their home state in Texas. In the summer of 2021, the state banned abortions as early as the first six weeks of pregnancy. The couple knew they didn't want another child, and decided that a vasectomy would be the most cost effective option available to them. He explained that the cost of contraception had been a roadblock for the couple, and said it shouldn't just be his partner's responsibility to take care of birth control. I don't think it's fair that it took overturning a woman's reproductive rights for this subject to get attention He told Health: ""It felt like almost immediately afterward, maybe two or three weeks later, Roe was overturned. And I was even more glad I did it. ""I don't have anymore anxiety now around having a healthy sex life, and that's a really nice feeling."" And now Keith is sharing his journey on TikTok in order to help other men who might be considering the procedure. He added: ""I'm really thankful for the traction my video has gotten. But I don't think it's fair that it took overturning a woman's reproductive rights for this subject to get attention."" The full-time TikTok influencer said vasectomies aren't talked about very much when it comes to the conversation on contraceptives and birth control - and he wants to change that.  Another man, Mike Pridgen, a 28-year-old comedian from New Jersey, filmed his surgery and popped it on TikTok. He even caught the moment a doctor made the “little pinch”.  He said: “That’s not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be."" The video has been viewed millions of times and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Mike's decision was wrapped in his choice not to have kids - for both financial and person reasons.  He said: “It is damn near impossible to raise a child, financially, in this country at this point. It’s also not particularly safe. ""Every day, you turn on the news, it feels as though this country is burning. So why would I want to bring a child into this?"" Like Keith, he aims to educate his followers about vasectomies and promote them as an alternative to other forms of birth control. Iowa-based Dr Esgar Guarínsaid said his latest wave of patients are men in their 30s who don’t want children as attitudes change and now they feel an urgent push to get snipped.  He said: ""At least men are waking up in our country and saying this is something we can do. That’s very nice. ""The problem to me is that it took restricting the right of an individual to be able to make decisions about her own body for men to start waking up. ""Men need to be more aware of their participation in reproductive health, because if we don't do that, we aren't going to change the behavior."" While less than two percent of unmarried men currently rely on vasectomy for contraception, it appears the trend could be changing as men decide to take more of a role in family planning. Surprisingly, the life-changing operation can be carried out in just 15 minutes. The procedure is typically carried out under local anaesthetic, so is often relatively painless. There are two ways to carry out a vasectomy, using the conventional or the no-scalpel method. The conventional vasectomy involves making two 1cm long incisions in the scrotum using a surgical knife. This allows the surgeon to remove a small section from the tubes linking the testicles and the penis, which are then tied or sealed shut. Medical professionals often use dissolvable stitches to close the incision. The second method is no-scalpel vasectomy, which is typically carried out under local anaesthetic. During the operation, surgeons puncture a small hole in the skin of the scrotum, which allows them to access the same tubes without using a scalpel. After the passage is closed, the puncture is closed in the same way as a conventional vasectomy. Patients that have had the sterilisation surgery are often able to return to work one or two days after getting it done.

"We lose two medics to suicide every week – it’s vital we remember them and tackle this hidden crisis, says Adam Kay","SAVING lives is an everyday job for many healthcare workers, but the pressure can take a heavy toll.  Devastatingly, two medical staff in the UK die of suicide each week, according to the Laura Hyde Foundation - this includes nurses, doctors, paramedics and more. To commemorate the lost lives of brave healthcare professionals, comedian and former doctor Adam Kay has planted a memorial tree at Ealing Hospital - the first of its kind in the UK. Speaking to The Sun, he said: ""It's an unthinkable tragedy. We don't talk about mental health enough, especially within the profession. ""This tree is the first ever memorial in the UK to the amazing medics who took their own lives. It means a huge amount to me. ""I knew people who took their own lives, and I'm not alone. The truth of the matter is, if you speak to any medical staff they'll all have a connection to someone who has killed themselves."" In the BBC drama This Is Going To Hurt - an adaptation of Adam's hit memoir about working in the NHS - a tree was planted to mark the loss of a doctor who took her own life. Ealing Hospital, where the programme was filmed, agreed to plant a similar memorial after fans got in touch with Adam saying they could not find it in real life. It has been named Shruti's Tree, after the character in the show.  Adam, who is a judge for this year's Who Cares Wins awards, added: ""A doctor in the UK takes their own life every three weeks. I hope we can look forward to a time in the future when that doesn't happen.  ""There are lots of amazing charities working to help stop suicide of medics happening. I'm proud to be here for the first memorial."" The planting is backed by charities The Laura Hyde Foundation (LHF) and Doctors in Distress - both aimed at helping healthcare workers with mental health.  Jennie Barnes - who set up LHF after her niece Laura, an A&E nurse, killed herself - believes the memorial is an important way to raise awareness about the profession's often-hidden pressures. If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, contact The Samaritans on 116 123. They are available for free at anytime. Or email https://www.samaritans.org/ She said: ""I hope this will help many more staff in the profession feel there is no stigma around mental health.  ""In fives years, I'd like to see one of these in every hospital. Laura was bright and vivacious but underneath all that, she was struggling with work stress.  ""She covered up how bad it was with her laughter, so after she died we wanted to do something good in her name."" The charity runs a 24-hour helpline to support medics that are struggling and is now involved in the training of student nurses and doctors to make them aware of the pressures when they qualify.  Fellow charity Doctors in Distress provides support to doctors who are struggling and tries to push for legislative change. Amandip Sidhu started the non-profit organisation after his brother, Dr Jagdip Sidhu, killed himself because he felt trapped and unable to escape his suffering.  Speaking about the tree, Amandip said: ""After losing my brother I wanted to do something to try and help the situation.  ""Having something like this tree and Adam Kay is absolutely phonomenal. It gives a platform to the issue."" ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/health-news/19473277/adam-kay-doctors-suicide-tree-who-cares-wins/
Major Covid rule change coming to Scotland in DAYS,"A MAJOR Covid rule has come under way nearly two years after restrictions were introduced in Scotland.  The change will be made on Monday for people in the greater Glasgow area. Women going through IVF treatment with the NHS will no longer need to face Covid restrictions from next week.  This means they will be able to bring partners with them to their medical appointments.  The change comes four months after people were allowed to visit all wards at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary.  Up until now, patients undergoing IVF have said they felt unsupported and overwhelmed during consultations.  NHS Glasgow and Greater Clyde said it needed to ""strike a balance"" between protecting patients and providing the best care possible.  The Glasgow health board also apologised for any ""distress or inconvenience"" caused by the policy.  A spokesperson said: ""While partners have been able to accompany the patient to specific appointments, such as egg collection and pregnancy scans, to ensure we could maintain high levels of safety as well as maximise the number of patients we could see, we limited partners' attendance at other more routine appointments. ""We are aware of the difficulties this might have caused for couples using our services, and we would like to apologise for any resulting distress or inconvenience. ""However, we are pleased to announce that, from Monday 8th August, all restrictions at the Assisted Conception Service will be removed and partners will be able to attend all appointments once more."" During the height of the pandemic, there were limits on how long partners could stay in the ward after birth.  Those who had successfully conceived also had to go to appointments alone.  But these restrictions were lifted  a few months ago.  Since April, visitors have been able to visit any hospital wards in Scotland without needing to face restrictions.  If you caught Covid recently and you're still feeling a bit woozy, it could be long Covid - read here.   ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19435107/major-covid-rule-change-announced-in-scotland/
My teeth have been left as tiny stumps and I’m in constant pain after dental treatment in Turkey ruined my smile,"A MUM has revealed how she’s been in constant pain after dental treatment in Turkey left her with tiny stumps for teeth. Zeba Ali, 34, a teacher, from London, has been left in “absolute agony” after jetting over 2,000 miles across the globe for the private procedure. Zeba recalls having no concerns over her teeth apart from one tooth on her bottom set, which was slightly misaligned . Because of the pricey UK dental costs she decided to consult a dentist based in Istanbul, Turkey, who she claims sold her a dream holiday alongside five-star dental treatment. After a five-minute video consultation, Zeba was advised to have veneers and as the dentist was top-rated, she trusted their decision and booked herself in for the procedure. But her dreams of having a perfect “Hollywood” smile were soon dashed. The mum was left with an array of issues from non-stop sensitivity to unbearable pain, where she’s unable to eat or drink properly – as her teeth were “accidentally” shaved into pegs. Zeba said: “I asked to look in the mirror, as I didn’t know what they were doing because I couldn’t feel anything and I ran out crying. “I felt my heart sink and was completely speechless – but it was too late. ""I was in a state of shock, because I thought they would be placing 'prepless' veneers and wouldn’t touch my natural teeth."" Zeba said she had initially spoke to the dentist via WhatsApp where they asked her to open my mouth so they could have a look. She continued: “As she was a five-star rated dentist, I put my trust in her and didn’t care about the money. “I was hoping to finally have aligned teeth, as well as being promised a luxury hotel with spa. “However, the experience was completely different from how they portrayed it and it was awful from the start."" In March 2022, she went to the clinic and paid £2,000 for whitening, a hygienist service and the main procedure. Upon arriving, she expected a further face-to-face consultation, but instead, she was immediately taken into surgery. She said: “I thought perhaps there wasn’t anything else I needed to know and I didn’t say anything as I put my complete trust in them. “I didn’t think prepless veneers involved shaving down natural teeth, especially as mine were healthy. “I informed them I wasn’t told this was going to happen and the procedure would be reversible – but they only apologised for the mistake."" “I was devastated, so immediately got up and left after the veneers, which were actually crowns, were placed.” Zeba claims that they neglected to tell her vital information and failed to mention that her teeth would be ruined forever. While she still boasts natural teeth on her top set, they also shaved two of these down for “aesthetic” reasons. And she has also been left unhappy with her lower set after being told her teeth would have a clean ‘veneer’ look - only to have them look thicker than before. Zeba said: “Over here, they wouldn’t touch my teeth as they were completely healthy and there was no need. “They would’ve turned me away and given proper orthodontic treatment or composite bonding instead. “After the numbing wore off, I felt the intense pain and since, I’ve had a constant problem in one of my teeth which often feels like a ‘prickling’ feeling."" The experience was completely different from how they portrayed it and it was awful from the start."" And Zeba says that she had to go back after complaining which resulted with the dentists giving her a root canal to remove the nerves within that tooth. However, the single mum now claims that ""the pain has worsened"" and she is considering getting the tooth extracted completely or having a dental implant. Zeba added: “I’m a single mum and it’s affecting my parenting as I’m being short and snappy with my child often. “It’s left me with a serious complex and it’s put severe pressure on my mental health. “Financially, it’s been a huge burden as I can’t keep taking time off to go back there and I’ll have to get expensive maintenance treatment for the rest of my life.” Zeba claims she was told the sensitivity would subside after six months, but five months later, there’s still been no sign of this. Due to the pain, she decided to visit her regular dentist in the UK, who told her the crowns will need to be replaced every five or 10 years. Now, she’s advised others who are interested in having dental work in Turkey to do thorough research beforehand. Zeba added: ""Always speak to a UK dentist first to see what they would offer, as they won’t touch you and do irreversible damage. “I’ve since been told I could have had braces or invisalign, which would have solved the problem and prevented cutting down my healthy teeth into stumps. “I’ve been offered compensation for the crowns only, which doesn’t even cover all the hotels, flights and transfers I’ve had to fork out for. “Turkish dentists are only interested in giving you the look you want, even if there’s no return or aftercare. ""I am absolutely gutted and just wish I had been advised not to cut my natural teeth by these money grabbing dentists, I would give anything to have my healthy teeth back.""

GPs threaten to strike over plans to make them work Saturdays and evenings,"GPs have threatened industrial action over plans to make them work Saturdays and evenings. Family doctors vowed to act if an NHS contract with the conditions is not axed. British Medical Association members say it is unworkable as it requires GPs to work in groups of practices called Primary Care Networks. They claim PCNs are inflexible and bureaucratic and that money for the scheme should form part of the GP contract. There were cheers at the BMA’s annual meeting in Brighton yesterday after 57 per cent of members agreed to “organise opposition”, including industrial action, if the contract remains. Proposing the motion to axe it, London GP Dr Jacqueline Applebee, said: “The new contracts have already effectively been imposed. How much more can we take?” Hailing the striking rail union, she said: “We should take our lead from the RMT. They have quite rightly said enough is enough. No more pay erosion, no more service cuts.” Dr Kieran Sharrock, of England’s GP committee at the BMA, said the vote illustrated the “ever-growing concerns about how well PCNs are actually working”. The vote follows a strike threat by hospital doctors seeking a 30 per cent pay hike. A GP strike could go ahead only if at least half of them agree in a new poll. A stop on emergency care is unlikely. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19030709/gps-threaten-strike-work-saturdays/
My son fell seriously ill on a TUI holiday – now we’re suing them along with 36 other families,"A MUM has told how she is suing TUI after her son fell seriously ill during their holidays at a five star Egyptian resort. Lawyers say her son and 35 other people had their holidays ruined by gastric symptoms whilst staying at the Jaz Aquamarine hotel in Hurghada between January and October 2019. Four holiday makers were hospitalised while eight people had Salmonella, one had the stomach bug Giardiasis and another person had E.Coli and Shigella. The holiday makers, who all booked their getaways via TUI, have launched legal action against the tour operator. Michelle Crowther, 43, and her two children Molly, 13, and George, 10, from Croydon, South London, all fell ill shortly after arrival. They all experienced abdominal cramps, nausea, diarrhoea, sweating and lethargy while George required medical attention and IV antibiotics during the holiday. Upon their return home, Michelle had to have a week off work and then had her working hours reduced for five months as she recovered. Michelle said: ""When we arrived, our first impressions were good. However, beneath the surface there were a lot of things wrong. ""I recall the buffet food being left exposed and it was lukewarm at times. The same utensils were used to handle both raw and cooked food, and children were often seen touching the food. ""There were even flies around it. I also remember our bed sheets weren't cleaned for eight days. ""Falling ill so early into our holiday left us unable to enjoy any part of it. ""Seeing my children unwell was the worst part, and I'm still not 100 per cent yet. ""All we want now are some answers as to how this happened."" Myfanwy Bunting, 50, and her husband Dean, 49, from Rhoose, South Wales,. had travelled to the hotel for their honeymoon with their daughter Edan, eight, in July 2019. Just three days into their two week break, Edan and Dean began suffering horrific symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea and a fever while Myfanwy fell ill the next day. After returning home to the UK, Edan felt better but Dean and Myfanwy's symptoms continued. Myfanwy, a self-employed property manager, went to her GP and was diagnosed with E.coli and Shigella. She said: ""While we were there, we noticed that the hotel kept shutting the pools for long periods of time. ""We were also concerned over the food not being handled well in the restaurants. We even saw some people picking up food, tasting it and then putting it back. ""After we fell ill, we spoke to our reps and hotel staff but we feel like they just fobbed us off and tried telling us that it was because we weren't used to the heat or the spicy food. ""But we were certain this wasn't the reason. ""I've never been so poorly, but it was still a huge shock when I found out I had E.coli as well as another gastric infection. ""It's not something you expect to have to deal with on your honeymoon. ""Our holiday was ruined and Dean and I still suffer from gastric problems to this day. ""While nothing will make up for what we've been through, we just want answers now and to know if anything else could have been done to stop it happening to others."" Neil Jones, 58, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, fell ill just two days into his holiday in July 2019 and only recovered three weeks later. Neil, a retired wall and floor tiler, said: ""I remember feeling so unwell and that the cramps were unbearable. I'm a grown man and I was nearly brought to tears by them. ""It was supposed to be a fun holiday, but my illness ruined the whole thing. ""When my girlfriend went to the chemist abroad, they asked her if we were from the Jaz Aqua before she even said what the issue was. ""She also heard other holidaymakers discussing getting ill there. ""Clearly something wasn't right there and we all deserve some answers."" Hannah Clifford, the specialist international serious injury lawyer at Irwin Mitchell representing those affected, said: ""To hear that so many people were struck down with debilitating illness after staying at Hurghada's Jaz Aquamarine hotel is deeply concerning. ""Our clients were understandably looking forward to their holidays and were left devastated when they developed gastric symptoms. ""These types of illnesses can lead to severe long-term conditions and should never be downplayed. ""The families continue to have questions regarding what they've been through, but TUI have thus far failed to engage with us. ""While they would rather not be in this position, they feel they have no option but to commence court proceedings to help them obtain the answers they deserve."" A TUI spokesperson said: ""We are sorry to hear of these experiences at the Jaz Aquamarine Hotel. As this is now a legal matter, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time. ""We’d like to reassure customers that we regularly audit all of our hotels in respect to health and safety, including hygiene."" The Jaz Aquamarine have been contacted for comment.

Now nannying health chiefs mull ban on tea and coffee for kids,"NOW nannying health bosses are looking at banning the sale of TEA to kids. The Welsh Government are currently consulting on whether to outlaw the sale of energy drinks to children under 16s. And they are asking whether to include tea and coffee on the black list too. The call for evidence from experts and industry makes clear Welsh ministers consider caffeine a menace to kids. It warns “energy drinks contain, on average, similar levels of caffeine to a double shot of espresso.” And it claims “children who drink energy drinks on five or more days per week were most likely to have low psychological, physical, educational and overall wellbeing, such as headaches, sleep problems, alcohol use, smoking, irritability, and school exclusion.” Therefore they “want to explore measures to ensure that we can protect our children’s health” - including an outright ban. A similar ban on energy drinks for kids is is in the pipeline from the UK Government as well. But in Wales experts are then asked: “Should the ban be widened to consider other drinks typically high in caffeine such as tea and coffee?” However, critics slammed that as nonsense and totally unworkable. Christopher Snowdon, Head of Lifestyle Economics at free market think tank Institute of Economic Affairs, said: “Banning the sale of tea and coffee to kids would be the logical extension of this unscientific policy. “Since a can of Red Bull has no more caffeine than a cup of instant coffee, it is for politicians to explain why one is too dangerous for fifteen year olds but the other is fine.  ""I’d like to see them try.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/health-news/18983768/now-nannying-health-chiefs-mull-ban-on-tea-for-kids/
"Quarter of kids think chicken is one of their five-a-day, study finds","A QUARTER of kids think chicken is one of their five-a-day, experts have revealed. Twenty per cent of those in primary school believe cheese also counts. And the number of teenagers who still think chicken is one of the five-a-day is 17 per cent. More of them believe that poultry meat is a source of fibre than carrots, the British Nutrition Foundation said. Sara Stanner, Science Director at the charity said: “Government advice is for us all to eat more plant-based foods because they’re good for us and for the environment. “It is concerning that there is confusion across the UK about the nutritional contents of some common foods, including plant-based foods. “Lack of knowledge means people are less empowered to make informed choices and achieving a healthy diet, with a good balance of the right types of foods, is more difficult if you don’t know which key nutrients the foods that we eat provide.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18974663/kids-chicken-five-a-day/
"GP contracts to be changed to get more seeing patients face to face, under Sajid Javid proposals","SAJID Javid is eyeing up major changes to GP contracts to get more doctors to see patients face to face. He wants to end the shameful postcode lottery which leaves millions of Brits unable to get an appointment not on Zoom. Vast parts of the country have a massive shortage of full-time GPs - fuelling the problem. The Health Secretary is considering a range of reforms to try to end the scandal. One option is to change GP contracts so they are “incentivised” to go from working part time to full time. While they could also be offered lucrative bungs to move to left-behind areas. And a big focus will also be put on getting GPs to offer more face to face appointments. A Government source said the aim is to give patients “more choice” so elderly patients are not forced to go online when they really want to physically see a doctor. But the number of face to face appointments “is expected to increase”. Whitehall insiders insisted that changing GP contracts is just one of the options being looked at. With No10 already bracing for a “summer of discontent” from militant rail unions, they do not want to have a row with doctors unions too. So they are expected to try to lure GPs into increasing their hours and being more flexible rather than ordering them to.

"Humans understand chimps’ sign language, scientists reveal","HUMANS understand chimps’ sign language, scientists say. We still have ancient instincts that help us read hand gestures used by our ancestors before we evolved to speak. Apes including chimpanzees, orangutans and bonobos still use the same signs to communicate. A study by the University of St Andrews in Scotland showed videos of 100 ape gestures to 5,656 people. Volunteers correctly worked out the meaning more than half the time — more than they could have guessed at random. Three quarters of people correctly guessed that a big chest scratch meant “groom me”. When a chimp touched another one’s mouth or tapped them, 79 per cent knew it meant “give me that food”. Two thirds knew a gentle shove by a chimp or bonobo was an instruction to move or climb on to their back. Study author and chimp expert Dr Cat Hobaiter said: “We can decode these gestures almost instinctively — it’s a useful reminder that we are also great apes. “Even though modern humans have language, we’ve kept some understanding of our shared ancestral system of ape communication.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21155212/humans-understood-chimpanzee-language/
Starlings create T-Rex shape across the sky as they form together,"THOUSANDS of starlings create a T-Rex shaped dino-soar effect as they swoop across the sky. The huge group, known as a murmuration, also formed up in shapes like a seal, peacock and whale. Wildlife snapper James Arnold, 61, spent seven weeks capturing the images near Malpas, Cheshire. The starlings gather to scare off predators such as sparrowhawks. James said: “As soon as I took the pictures I knew I had got something special. It is quite a thing to see.” “There were thousands and thousands of them moving in incredible shapes like dolphins, seals and all sorts of birds. It was a great thing to catch. “Since then I have been trying to find places that have the same thing but I have not experienced that since. “These shapes are created when birds of prey are trying to come and catch them and kill them.

"Orangutans may hold the key to how humans evolved to speak, say scientists","ORANGUTANS may hold the key to how humans evolved to speak, say scientists. The ginger tree-swingers — like The Jungle Book’s King Louie — “talk” using a complex range of calls involving both vowel sounds and consonants. But other advanced, ground-dwelling apes such as chimpanzees can make only vowels as their lips, tongues and jaws lack flexibility. Researchers say that because orangutans lived up in the trees, they had to use a limb to cling on — so used their mouths to strip hard-to-get plants, fruits and nuts. Professor Adriano Lameira said: “Because of this, orang­utans developed greater control over their lips, tongue and jaw and can use their mouths as a fifth hand to hold food and manoeuvre tools.” It suggests living in trees was a pre-adaptation for the evolution of speech — and that human ancestors had a more arboreal lifestyle than was thought. Vowel sounds come from the throat, while consonants rely on the tongue, lips and teeth. Primatalogist Prof Lameira, of Warwick University, said: “Wild orangutans use consonant-like calls consistently and for multiple behaviours, much like we do with speech.  “Their vocal repertoire is a rich display of clicks, kiss-sounds, smacking, splutters and raspberries.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/20820818/orangutans-talk-human-evolution-speech-say-scientists/
Fears men could soon be extinct after scientists find endangered rats lack male Y chromosome,"SCIENTISTS fear men could be wiped out after discovering that endangered rats lack the male Y chromosome. They say humans’ version of the gene data has been shrinking in size for years and may die out altogether. Experts tested Ryukyu spiny rats living on the Japanese island of Amami Oshima. Only a few now remain — but none has the Y chromosome. A baby’s gender is determined by chromosomes known as X and Y, which carry our DNA. Males have XY while females have XX. When conceiving a child, women contribute an X while men contribute the X or Y. Study author Professor Asato Kuroiwa, of Hokkaido University, said: “Y chromosomes in many mammals have been shrinking over tens of millions of years — and could eventually disappear.” Award-winning geneticist Jenny Graves claimed two decades ago that our Y chromosome will eventually go. Prof Graves, of La Trobe University, Melbourne, told New Scientist: “I think this latest piece of work is brilliant. The evidence is very compelling. “There is no reason to think our Y chromosome is any more robust than the spiny rat’s.” Prof Kuroiwa said: “I agree with Jenny. I also believe the Y chromosome will disappear.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/20635460/endangered-rats-y-chromosomes-males-risk-wiped-out/
"Untrained rats can dance and prefer similar musical beat to humans, study finds","UNTRAINED rats can dance — and prefer a similar musical beat to humans, a study claims. Scientists believe it proves for the first time animals have an inbuilt rhythm. They attached motion sensors to the heads of 20 people and ten rats then played Mozart’s Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major. The humans and the rodents bobbed along in the same way as they listened at normal speed — 132 beats per minute. But the Japanese study showed they grooved less when the piece was slowed down or sped up. Many animals can be trained to dance or react to music. But Prof Hirokazu Takahashi of the University of Tokyo said: “This is the first report of innate beat synchronisation in animals without training or musical exposure. They displayed it most distinctly within 120 to 140 bpm, to which humans also exhibit the clearest synchronisation.” He believes the creatures are genetically programmed to feel human music as the brain’s auditory cortex is similarly tuned. Rats dancing to music are traditionally seen on BBC1’s Strictly. Comedian Seann Walsh, 36, who had a long-term partner, was caught snogging married dancer Katya Jones, 33, in 2018. Former Strictly pro Vincent Simone, 43, admitted cheating on his pregnant wife with co-star Kristina Rihanoff, 45, in 2009. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/20401341/untrained-rats-can-dance-study/
What is Planet X? Conspiracy theory explained,"WEALTHY businessman Percival Lowell was a 19th-century astronomer who claimed to have found the ninth planet, although scientists have claimed no such planet exists. The unconfirmed planet was named Planet X and has created a basis for conspiracy theorists who claimed it will cause the world's end. Percival Lowell was a wealthy businessman-turned-astronomer in the 19th century after he reportedly read a book on Mars and was inspired to study the universe. As he searched for phenomena through the lens of a telescope, Lowell made numerous conspiracy claims, one of which was the belief he had found the ninth planet, which he called planet X. Although Lowell never saw the planet, he remained convinced of its existence and when he died in 1916, he left $1million to fund research that would locate the elusive Planet X. Astronomers continued to search for the ninth planet and thought they found it when they discovered Pluto in 1930, which later turned out to be a dwarf planet. The search for planet X ended in 1989 when astronomers concluded the planet never existed and the search had been in vain. However, the search was revisited after two astronomers discovered the Kuiper Belt in 1992 and discovered three other dwarf planets, Sedna (about 40 percent the size of Pluto), Quaoar (about half the size of Pluto), and Eris (almost the same size as Pluto). The discovery showed a gravitational pull from outside the immediate universe that affected Sedna, taking it from the center of our solar system, which is about 11billion miles from the sun, to more than 84billion miles, meaning it takes 11k years to complete its orbit. Astronomers believed this discovery meant there may be a planet outside our solar system that is between five and ten times the size of Earth. More than 130 years after Lowell proclaimed there is a ninth planet in 1855, scientists have still been unable to find it but Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin are continuing their search. Brown and Batygin are professors of planetary science at Caltech and co-authored their paper proposing that a massive planet does exist. ""I didn't have a particularly strong appreciation for just how difficult would be to find Planet Nine until I started looking together with Mike using telescopes,"" Batygin told the BBC. ""The reason it's such a tough search is because most astronomical surveys are not looking for a single thing."" He told the outlet their opportunities to search for the ninth planet are limited because they only get three nights each year to use the lab's telescope. Despite the limited opportunities with the telescope, he said: ""The good news is that the Vera Rubin telescope is coming online within the next couple of years, and they are going to probably find it."" Conspiracy theorists first predicted that planet X would cause the end of the world in 2003, which they believed would smash into Earth, causing its complete destruction. Planet X, also known as Nibiru, should have collided with Earth on several occasions based on conspiracy theorist claims and YouTube videos and websites that feed into the doomsday theory. David Morrison, a planetary astronomer at NASA Ames Research Center and senior scientist at the NASA Astrobiology Institute and NASA Lunar Science Institute said on Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SERVI) website that he gets roughly five emails each day asking about Earth's destruction. “At least once a week I get a message from a young person ― as young as 11 ― who says they are ill and/or contemplating suicide because of the coming doomsday,” Morrison told SERVI in 2012. Although followers of this conspiracy theory first believed it doomsday would occur in 2003, Nancy Lieder was the first person to predict such an occurrence in 1995. Lieder claimed aliens in the Zeta Reticuli star system sent her messages through an implant they placed in her brain. She claimed they told her planet X would crash into Earth in 2003, effectively wiping out all civilization. However, when her prophecy didn't happen, her followers selected 2012 as the projected year for the collision, which coincided with other doomsday conspiracy theories and the end of the Mayan calendar which many believed predicted the end of the world because it ended that year. Morrison advised those who follow conspiracy theories to gauge their belief system based on mainstream news rather than the opinion of an anonymous source online. “If [a story] is real, it is likely to be in regular news media, not just posted on some website,” Morrison told the outlet, adding: “Not everyone who claims on YouTube to be a scientist or an employee of NASA is. But there is no simple way to distinguish truth from lies.” The conspiracy theory that planet X will collide with Earth has continued long past the first 2003 claim, with three additional projected dates occurring in 2017 and 2018. Scientists have said they are tired of the substantial amount of doomsday misinformation that is circulating online, and Morrison expressed his disdain on the SETI Institute podcast in 2017 after he was asked about claims of a third apocalypse in three months. “You’re asking me for a logical explanation of a totally illogical idea,"" he said. “There is no such planet, there never has been, and presumably there never will be — but it keeps popping up over and over.” He said NASA had contemplated responding for fear of legitimizing the doomsday claims, but after receiving an email from a 12-year-old girl who said she and her classmates were afraid of the end of the world, they decided they needed to say something. Morrison started posting YouTube videos to educate young viewers about misinformation, and conspiracy theories, and to inform them that planet X does not exist. When Morrison's website was inundated with comments and predictions about the alleged 2012 collision of planet X and Earth in 2008, he wrote: “I assumed that Nibiru was the sort of Internet rumor that would quickly pass. “I now receive at least one question per day, ranging from anguished ‘I can’t sleep;' 'I am really scared;' 'I don’t want to die’ to the abusive ‘Why are you lying;' 'you are putting my family at risk;' 'if NASA denies it then it must be true.’” NASA finally spoke out in a 2012 statement, saying: “Nibiru [planet X] and other stories about wayward planets are an Internet hoax. “If Nibiru or Planet X were real and headed for an encounter with the Earth … astronomers would have been tracking it for at least the past decade, and it would be visible by now to the naked eye.” We pay for your stories!

Are aliens real? Conspiracy theory explained,"SCIENTISTS are questioning if aliens really exist, a question that has caused debate and controversy among humans for centuries. The US government's unclassified report on Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) was released in June 2021 and discussed whether extraterrestrial life had been found. Marilyn Monroe's death remains shrouded in mystery, and one conspiracy theory claims the actress was murdered by the US government after threatening to reveal top-secret information about aliens. The theory was revealed in the UFO documentary Unacknowledged and claimed Monroe made the threats after having affairs with both then-President John F Kennedy and Bobby Kennedy and was allegedly seeking revenge after they both ended their relationship with her. In September 2017, it was also reported that Chuck Zukowski and Debbie Ziegelmeyer discovered a ""UFO highway"" across America. The brother and sister alien hunters spent years traveling across the US investigating hundreds of UFO sightings and other paranormal occurrences. The pair believe the 37th latitude line is a kind of UFO or paranormal highway along which extra terrestrial craft enter and exit the earth. Their theory became the subject of the book titled the 37th Parallel, written by Ben Mezrich. Chuck told The Sun: “Back in 2006 I was looking at my cattle mutilation investigations - there were huge similarities between them all - most of them were laying on their right side, they’re laying east to west and then I noticed that lots of them were on the 37-degree latitude. “I called my sister at midnight and I said, ‘Didn’t you have cattle mutilations on the 37-degree latitude in Missouri?' ""And she said, 'Yes' and we started looking more into it. We soon realized it wasn’t just cattle mutilations – there were all kind of events."" He added: ""We're up until 2.30 in the morning going through all these cases and started seeing these amazing patterns.” The 37th latitude line runs from California through Nevada, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, and across to Virginia. Meanwhile, Paul O'Grady revealed he is too terrified to go to sleep in case he wakes up surrounded by aliens. The 67-year-old presenter even fears extra-terrestrial beings from outer space are watching him after first realizing it when listening to an interview with 80s pop singer Kim Wilde. The number of UFO sightings is currently flying at an all-time high, according to data cruncher and blogger Sam Monfort. The alien expert said there have been more than 100k recorded UFO sightings in the past 100-plus years. An alien autopsy video dates back to 1995 with a video of fighter jets that appear to be chasing a UFO over the M5. There are hundreds of additional videos that people have claimed to be proof of alien life. There's even a clip of a UFO supposedly attacking a Taliban compound, as well as sightings in Peckham and Warminster. Most of the videos have been debunked by experts. In the M5 clip, for example, the trucks on highways look like models of real things. Meanwhile, the Peckham UFOs were ""almost certainly Chinese lanterns,"" former Ministry of Defence UFO investigator Nick Pope told The Sun. He added that ""true believers wouldn’t be dissuaded"" by evidence the videos are fake. Popstar Peter Andre also claimed to have seen several UFOs on a family trip through the Nevada desert. The desert is also the site of America's famous Area 51 - a highly classified military base at the center of alien conspiracy theories due to scores of UFO sightings in the area. Artist Dave Huggins believes he lost his virginity to a busty alien called Crescent - and has allegedly fathered 60 'hybrid' babies. Some people even believe this picture of Jesus' crucifixion - which hangs on the walls of the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral in Georgia - is proof that aliens visited Earth thousands of years ago. In July 2017, new research was published that suggested ""free-floating"" earth-sized plants could exist and that some of them may even be able to harbor life. And at the end of August, alien hunters from the Breakthrough Listen project detected ""fast radio bursts"" coming from a mysterious cluster of stars – which may have been produced by ""extraterrestrial civilizations."" In October 2017, an Australian woman took a picture of what she believed was a ""flying saucer"" hovering over the Great Barrier Reef. Far North Queensland is considered a UFO hotspot, with several sightings of mystery aircraft in the sky over several decades. A UFO shaped like a tic-tac stalked a US Aircraft carrier for days before vanishing into thin air, according to a Pentagon report which emerged in May 2018. The object - which could reportedly hover in midair and make itself invisible - bamboozled US Navy fighter pilots during a training exercise in the Pacific Ocean in November 2004. In July 2018 a secret dossier revealed that British spies spent at least 50 years hunting UFOs in the hope of stealing alien technology. The US government released a report in 2021 that would allegedly support the notion that alien lifeforms may exist, but they instead found they were unable to confirm 143 out of 144 reported UFO sightings. A study by The Astrophysical Journal Letters found there is no evidence to support the theory that there is alien life in our universe. The other planets that are similar to Earth orbit M dwarf stars and do not have an atmosphere necessary to sustain life. An M dwarf star, also known as a red dwarf, has a likeness to the sun but with a lower luminosity, they are found to be the smallest and coolest stars. A planet would need to closely orbit an M dwarf star to be warm enough to host life and researchers have found it is not possible. ""It's possible this planet's condition could be a bad sign for planets even further away from this type of star,"" Michelle Hill, an astrophysicist at the University of California Riverside and co-author of the study, said in a statement. ""This is something we'll learn from the James Webb Space Telescope, which will be looking at planets like these."" However, the new data revealed if a planet is far enough away from an M dwarf star, it may retain an atmosphere, Scientists hope the James Webb Space Telescope can shed light on our universe and other universes through highly focused images. The telescope is highly advanced and may provide the information needed to determine if there are, in fact, planets that can sustain life. ""We will see the more distant, more extreme galaxies, where the environmental conditions are very different from what we see in the Milky Way,"" Olivia Jones, a JWST scientist at the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh, told Space.com. ""Previously, we could only see stars about 8 times the mass of the sun, she said. ""But now we should be able to see the formation of stars about as big as the sun and that process has never been observed before.""

Britain braced for invasion of creepy cannibal praying mantis,"BRITAIN is bracing itself for a praying mantis invasion. The insects, commonly found in France, have already been tracked to the Channel Islands. Record numbers of them have been recorded on the south east coast of Jersey.  Experts say they are moving further North as our climate warms up. Praying mantis can grow up to 30cm in length and females are known to eat males after sex.  They also eat flies and crickets. Jersey’s Sangan Island Conservation said: “We don’t think they are breeding but that will be the next thing we ask people to keep an eye out for.  “As a species they should just fit in with our ecosystem and on paper there isn’t a perceived negative impact from their arrival.” Last year a European praying mantis was caught in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwicks.

"Humans evolved from armoured shark that lived 439 million years ago, researchers claim","HUMANS evolved from an armoured shark that lived 439 million years ago, researchers claim. Scientists reckon the bizarre beast could be our oldest jawed ancestor. The fish, named Fanjingshania renovata, grew to up to 2½ft. It was covered in bony plates and bristled with spines on its fins. It has been reconstructed from thousands of tiny skeletal fragments unearthed at a prehistoric animal graveyard in southern China.  The fish was an early member of the modern gnathostomes, meaning “jaw-mouths”. They include tens of thousands of living vertebrates, ranging from fish to birds, reptiles and mammals. Fanjingshania belonged to a group known as chondrichthyans — fish such as sharks and rays with a skeleton made of cartilage. It lived before the split between the earliest sharks and the first bony fishes — a lineage that eventually included humans. But its bones show evidence of extensive changes typically associated with skeletal development in bony fish — and humans. One of the study’s authors, Professor Zhu Min, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, said: “This is the oldest jawed fish with known anatomy. “The new data allowed us to place Fanjingshania in the family tree of early vertebrates and gain much needed information about the evolutionary steps leading to the origin of important vertebrate adaptations such as jaws, sensory systems and paired appendages.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19949855/humans-evolved-from-armoured-shark/
"Cavemen carried out medical amputations over 30,000 years ago — and the patients survived","CAVEMEN carried out medical amputations more than 30,000 years ago — and the patients survived, scientists have discovered. The prehistoric procedures were tens of thousands of years before the discovery of antiseptics — normally a must to fight off post-surgery infections usually leading to death. Experts found the skeleton in a cave in Borneo of a Stone Age human male who had his left foot surgically removed — and lived around another ten years. The patient is believed to have been aged around 11 when his foot was cut off. A “clean sloping cut” excludes an accident, experts said. They reckon this “remarkable” find is the first example of a complex operation and “rewrites history of human medical knowledge”. Amputations require detailed understanding of human anatomy and good hygiene. Before antiseptics were first used in the 19th century, most patients died from blood loss, shock or infection. Tim Maloney, of Australia’s Griffith University, told journal Nature that it shows “a really strong case the community had developed advanced medical understandings”.

Blood-sucking bedbugs & ‘porn star’ fleas set for population explosion in homes,"BLOOD-sucking bedbugs and “porn star” fleas are set for a population explosion in homes. A mild winter followed by a hot summer were ideal conditions for breeding, experts say. Bedbugs will be lurking in dark corners and skirting boards, ready to hunt for an easy meal when people dive under the duvet this autumn. And super fleas with male genitals two-and-a-half times longer than their bodies have had “an abundant breeding season which is set to continue this autumn”, pest control group Basis Prompt warned. Basis Prompt added: “The summer weather has been ideal for creatures like fleas and bedbugs. ""If you do have fleas in your home, you may even see them jumping on your carpet or furniture.” Favourite flea target areas are low down - around the ankles or legs. Pets that are constantly scratching can provide the first sign of an infestation.  Pharmacists at Chemist Direct have reported a jump in sales of Anthisan flea bite cream. The Fine Bedding Company said: “Duvets should be washed every few months, or at least twice a year, and replaced every five years, pillows more frequently - every two to three years.” The RSPCA says a flea can live from between 14 days up to one year, with the female laying up to 50 eggs a day.

Cambridge University’s Martine Skumlien said: “We’re so used to seeing ‘lazy stoners’ on our screens we don’t ask whether they’re an accurate representation.  “Our work implies that this is a lazy stereotype.” The study asked 274 teen and adult spliff smokers in London to rate aspects of their personality and enjoyment of life.  They also had to press buttons quickly in sequence to win rewards.  Boffins found no difference in answers or results compared with similar aged people who did not smoke wacky baccy. Prof Barbara Sahakian reckoned: “Our evidence indicates cannabis does not appear to have an effect on motivation for recreational users.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19681822/stereotyping-cannabis-smokers-dull-unmotivated-unfair/
Killer Asian hornets invading Britain are being BEHEADED by native British species,"HORDES of killer Asian hornets invading Britain are being wiped out by our home-grown insect hit squads. The unwelcome aliens, whose sting can be deadly to humans, are being ruthlessly beheaded by native hornets. The Asians are reportedly surrounded by the bigger and tougher defenders and dragged away to an execution spot, where their heads are bitten off. It is a sight giving hope to volunteers battling to keep the invaders from our shores. Asian hornets, first seen in Europe in 2004, are feared because they destroy honey bees. But they pack enough venom to send a human into a life-threatening anaphylactic shock. So far, Defra records show just one confirmed sighting of an Asian hornet in Britain in 2022. But record numbers have been seen in Jersey, where 106 have been destroyed this year. Volunteers there are battling to keep them at bay as warm weather encourages nest-building. Chief bug buster Alastair Christie, 56, said: “Almost every day we are finding two or three nests.” But Channel Islands wildlife expert Bob Tompkins said he had seen the invaders being attacked. He wrote in his newspaper column: “More recently, I have begun to find dead Asian hornets that have clearly been stung, killed and partially dismembered.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19669586/asian-hornets-invading-britain-beheaded/
Scientists grow mouse embryos with working hearts and brains WITHOUT using sperm or eggs in incredible breakthrough,"SCIENTISTS have for the first time created mouse embryos with working hearts and brains — without using sperm or eggs. They used blank stem cells to grow the embryos, describing it as the “holy grail” of creating life in a lab. The embryos grew for 8½ days like a natural pregnancy and developed beating hearts and fully formed brains. The scientists from Cambridge University who created the embryos hope they will help them study the brain in pregnancy without using live animals. It could reveal why humans miscarry early, they said in journal Nature. Study leader Professor Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz called the work “complex and beautiful”. She said: “This not only develops a brain, but also a beating heart and all the components that go on to make up the body. “It’s just unbelievable that we’ve got this far.” Prof David Glover, of the California Institute of Technology, called it the first demonstration of the development of the forebrain. He said: “That’s been a sort of holy grail for the field.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19621495/mouse-embryos-no-sperm-eggs/
Watch as Perseid Meteor Shower 2022 lights up the night sky as stargazers look to the heavens for incredible display,"THE Perseid meteor shower is set to light up the night skies for a third night running on Saturday as a heavenly display explodes above earth. The shower peaked in the early hours of Saturday, with up to 150 shooting stars streaking through the sky per hour. But it will continue over the weekend offering a stunning display for stargazers across Britain. The shower is considered one of the best of the year because it produces bright meteors and is one of the most active. Its shooting stars leave distinctive “wakes” of light and colour, and the Perseids are well known for extraordinary fireballs which streak across the night sky brighter and longer than an average meteor. The display is caused by Earth slamming into the debris left behind by comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle. Stunning footage captured the galactic light show in full swing on Friday night as the shower showed off the true wonders of our universe. The shower gets its name from the Perseus constellation which is where astronomers believe the meteors burst out from. The Royal Observatory, Greenwich, noted that in 2022 the shower will be active between August 17 and 24. Observers can look out for the shower wherever they are, but a clear sky with minimal light pollution offers the best chance of catching a glimpse. One issue currently is that because of the full moon - the conditions are not ideal. The August full moon is also known as the Sturgeon Moon, named by North American fishing tribes since the species appeared in number during this month. Though Brits will still be able to catch a few glimpses if they keep their eyes peeled. But all is not lost for stargazers. Saturn will be at its closest approach to earth on Sunday with its face fully illuminated by the sun.  It will be brighter than at any time of the year and you will be able to see it throughout the night.

Saturn facts: How many moons does the planet have?,"SATURN is notably the most unique among the planets - adorned with thousands of beautiful ringlets. But how many moons does the planet have? And what else should we know about this fascinating planet - here's all the facts. Saturn has 82 moons.  However, only 53 of these moons are confirmed and named. Another 29 moons are awaiting confirmation of discovery and official naming.  These moons rangle massively in size from the giant moon Titan, which is bigger than the planet Mercury, to others which are as small as a sports arena. Titan, the planet’s largest satellite, has a rare molecule with a similar chemical structure to DNA in its atmosphere, astronomers say. This means it may have the ideal conditions to support alien life. The finding suggests a salty ocean beneath Titan’s icy crust may contain further building blocks of life, potentially making it a paradise for fledgling ETs. Rosaly Lopes, a Nasa research scientist, said: “We’re trying to figure out if Titan is habitable.” The experts say the types of molecules that may sit on Titan’s surface could be the same ones that formed the building blocks of life on Earth billions of years ago. Back then, when methane filled Earth’s air instead of oxygen, conditions could have been similar to those on Titan today, scientists suspect. Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the solar system, behind Jupiter. Like Jupiter, Saturn is a giant gas planet and is composed of similar gases including hydrogen, helium and methane. If you're are a lover of astronomy - then you will love finding out things you never knew about the solar system. And we have a number of fascinating facts about one of the solar system's residents - Saturn. Here's everything you need to know. It’s thought Saturn’s rings are made up of pieces of comets, asteroids, or shattered moons that broke up before they reached the planet. They are made of billions of small chunks of ice and rock coated with other materials such as dust. Each ring orbits at a different speed and the rings extend up to 175,000 miles out from the planet. The rings are named alphabetically in the order that they were discovered. Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are visible for much of the year. Neptune and Uranus are not visible - and of course the eighth planet in our solar system is Earth itself. Planets look different to stars because their brightness varies in a cycle over a period of time and they are close enough to Earth to look like a tiny disk whereas stars look like a point of light. Saturn and Mars are commonly mistaken for stars during their dimmer periods, according to Naked Eye Planets. Stars also generate their own light whereas planets do not.  Planets shine by reflecting a portion of the sunlight they receive back into space. The brightness of the planet depends on its distance from the Sun, the size of the planet and the position of the planet and Earth. Planets can be seen during a period called apparition.  Mars, Mercury and Venus can be seen during dawn or dusk when in this period. Jupiter and Saturn can be seen in the dawn sky - apparitions can last a few weeks (in the case of Mercury) to almost two years (in the case of Mars). The distance to Saturn from Earth is constantly changing - as both of the planets make their way through space.  When the two are closest, they lie approximately 746 million miles apart - or eight times the distance between the Earth and the Sun. At their most distant they are just over a billion miles apart - or 11 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Saturn was formed at the same time as the rest of the solar system - from a large spinning disk of gas and dust.  According to astronomers, all this happened around 4.6 billion years ago - so Saturn is about 4.6 billion years old. Like all of the planets, Saturn travels in an ellipse rather than a circular path - and so its distance from the sun varies slightly over the course of its year. Saturn averages 886 million miles from the Sun, at its farthest Saturn hovers 934 million miles and at its closest , the distance to Saturn from the sun is 839 million miles. This means at such a distance Saturn's temperature remains chilly all year round. Unlike Earth, Saturn is not a solid planet - instead it is a giant gas planet. It is made up of 94% hydrogen, 6% helium and small amounts of methane and ammonia. Hydrogen and helium are what most stars are made of.  As of January, 2022, four spacecrafts have flown by, or around this planet. In 1979, Pioneer 11 became the first spacecraft to ever fly by Saturn  and study the spectacular planet up close. In 1980 and 1981, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 also flew close enough to study Saturn as well as many of its moons. In 2004 the Cassini spacecraft reached Saturn. This spacecraft was able to send back observations of the planet, its moons, and ring system - until it was sent in a controlled plunge into Saturn’s atmosphere on September 15, 2017. Saturn orbits the Sun once every 29.4 Earth years - or once every 10,755.7 Earth days. This slow moving planet has earned itself the nickname of “Lubadsagush” from the ancient Assyrians, meaning ''oldest of the old''. Saturn travels at an average speed of 21,637 miles per hour or 34,821 kilometers per hour in its orbit around the Sun.

Georgian-era UFO Westminster sighting found in Royal Society journal from 1746,"’TIS most certainly a case for Master Mulder and Mistress Scully. Britain’s first X-File has been found — and it dates from 1742, when George II was king. Physician Cromwell Mortimer reported seeing a UFO over central London, and even drew a diagram of the mystery craft. Mortimer, secretary of the Royal Society, saw it above St James’s Park as he walked home to Westminster on December 16 at 8.40pm. He wrote: “I saw a light arise from behind the trees and houses in the south by west point. When it had risen to the height of about 20 degrees, it took a motion nearly parallel to the horizon and went over the houses.” He believed it passed over Bloomsbury before he “lost sight of it over the Haymarket”.  He added: “Its motion was so very slow, that I had it above half a minute in view; and had time enough to contemplate its appearance fully.”His diagram showed a flaming head “enclosed as it were in an open case” with “bands of iron”. It had a long tail of light, growing gradually fainter. Mortimer published his report in 1746 in the journal Philosophical Transactions, vol XLIII, which has recently come to light. British UFO expert Steve Mera said: “It is the first of it’s kind.” He went on: “Folk stood out on a balcony witnessed it. They were well to do, which encouraged proper research into it.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19475758/georgian-era-ufo-sighting-in-westminster/
Nasa spacecraft snaps reveal giant ear-shaped crater on Mars,"EAR’S a discovery worth trumpeting about — a giant lughole on Mars. The familiar shape was on one of the latest images beamed back from the Red Planet by a Nasa spacecraft. It appears to have a lobe and ear canal opening but, alas, no pointy top like Mr Spock’s ears in Star Trek. In fact, the shape is a crater left behind after a space rock smashed into the planet’s surface. It is 1.8km across and was spotted in Mars’s northern hemisphere. Nasa called it an example of pareidolia, where we imagine features, such as faces, or patterns in objects. It said: “In this case, we’re looking at an odd-shaped impact crater that looks a great deal like an ear.  ""And once you see it, it’s almost impossible to un-see.” The image was captured by the US space agency’s Mars.  Reconnaissance Orbiter during a fly-past 291km above the surface in September 2020. The craft, which has been orbiting and studying the planet since 2006, uses imaging technology nicknamed HiRise to study the geology and climate of Mars. It is not the first time body parts have been spotted on the planet — the orbiter picked up a happy face crater near its south pole, while a European craft found an eyeball crater in June. Another crater caught by HiRise in 2018 was said to resemble arcade favourite Pac-Man in full munching mode, while the following year it found what appeared to be an E and a T daubed on the planet.

Pigs brought back to life after their hearts stopped in ‘incredibly significant’ breakthrough,"PIGS have been partly brought back to life an hour after their hearts stopped in an “incredibly significant” breakthrough. The technique could revolutionise transplantation by giving doctors extra time to harvest organs, experts say. And it could help bring back people who have died from drowning or cardiac arrest — but some doctors have raised ethical concerns over the idea. The OrganEx technique, reported in Nature, involved Yale researchers pumping a cocktail of synthetic blood and drugs into pigs that had been dead for an hour. Six hours later, organs, including the heart, were partly revived.  Dr Sam Parnia, from New York University Grossman School of Medicine, said: “This is a truly remarkable and incredibly significant study.” An NHS Blood and Transplant spokesperson said the research had “potentially far-reaching applications”. But Dr Anders Sandberg, from Oxford University, said: “There is a risk that it mainly prevents people from dying rather than making them recover.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19411641/pigs-brought-back-life-hearts-stopped/
How long is Dippy the Dinosaur?,"IF you've been to a history museum across the UK, you might have come across Dippy The Dinosaur. Get to know more about the nation's favourite dinosaur and its tour across the UK. Dippy the Dinosaur is a replica of a diplodocus made from original fossil bones discovered in the US in 1898. A diplodocus is a herbivore dinosaur with a long neck that was used to reach high and low vegetation and water. It lived during the Jurassic Period which would be about 150 million to 155 million years ago. It arrived in the Natural History Museum in London in 1905 and then moved to central hall in 1979. He became a symbol of the museum as he stood inside the main visitors' entrance before he went on tour for visitors in different parts of the UK to also see him. On the tour, he also got some upkeeping with remaking some parts and giving him a new, modular support structure which will make the packing and unpacking easier. Dippy got to visit several places across the UK while on tour such as Dorset, Birmingham, Newcastle upon Tyne, Wales, and Glasgow. When he was kicking off on tour in 2017, Museum director Sir Michael Dixon said: ""We wanted Dippy to visit unusual locations so he can draw in people that may not traditionally visit a museum. ""Making iconic items accessible to as many people as possible is at the heart of what museums give to the nation, so we have ensured that Dippy will still be free to view at all tour venues."" Dippy the Dinosaur's length is about 88 feet, making the diplodocus the longest known dinosaur. That would be converted to 27 metres. Dippy the Dinosaur is back in the National History Museum until 2023 when it finds another place to visit. It was moved for the first time from this museum in 2017, after 112 years. Its tour resulted in an income of just under £36 million and created what was called the ""Dippy effect"" as it saw an increase of museum visitors everywhere it went.

Record temperatures and hot winds from South cause steep rise in large moths,"RECORD temperatures and hot winds from the South have seen a steep rise in large moths. Experts say there are six times more than usual in British gardens — and three times more than the previous record year of 2017. The two-inch wide hummingbird hawk moths breed 5,000 miles away in Africa and in southern Europe — with a few making it to Britain in summer on warm winds. But recent weather patterns have seen them arrive in much greater numbers — with sightings in six per cent of gardens instead of the usual one per cent.  Numbers are usually higher in September, so more could be on the way. They feed from flowers while hovering, just like regular tropical hummingbirds. It is the only moth species included in the Garden BirdWatch, run by the British Trust for Ornithology.  The group said: “In recent weeks, we have seen unusually high numbers. “Feeding on the wing from a long proboscis can often mean they are mistaken for actual hummingbirds, hence the name. ""In recent weeks, we have seen unusually high numbers of gardens reporting these large, charismatic moths. ""During June and July, we’d expect a little over one per cent of gardens to report them, but this has been as high as six per cent in July. ""Hummingbird Hawk Moths are largely a migratory species in the UK, breeding further south in Europe and Africa, and numbers increase following warm, southerly winds.""

"Chocolate protects your heart by lowering blood pressure and benefits are ‘undeniable’, scientists reveal","CHOCOLATE protects your heart by lowering blood pressure, researchers have found. Flavanols — antioxidants found in cocoa — help loosen veins and arteries. A University of Surrey study found people who took cocoa supplements had lower blood pressure and stretchier blood vessels within three hours. The super-concentrated pills had as many flavanols as about 500g of dark chocolate. Study author Professor Christian Heiss said: “The positive impact cocoa flavanols have on our cardiovascular system is undeniable. “We used a lot of flavanols but some dark chocolate has significant amounts, too. “Average intake of flavanols is about three times lower than you need to feel the effects so I think even if people increase it a little bit they would get a benefit. “A diet of 100 per cent chocolate would definitely cause other problems but you can also get them from red wine, blueberries and spinach.” One in three Brits has high blood pressure and it increases their risk of heart attack and stroke. The study, published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition, saw 11 people alternate days between cocoa pills or a placebo during their normal daily life. It found blood pressure was lower on the days they took the cocoa and their blood vessels were more able to grow and shrink. The supplements did not lower blood pressure on days when it was already low, which could give it an edge over current medications. Prof Heiss added: “The next step is to test it in patients to see if it’s useful. “We don’t know whether it can replace pills but I think in the future we’re going to try. “Drugs don’t work for a good proportion of people so if someone doesn’t have a really high blood pressure we might want to start with a health intervention like this.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/science/19328889/chocolate-protects-heart-blood-pressure/
"I’m a shark expert and I know the best way to survive an attack, but you’ll need to be brave","A SHARK expert has revealed the best way to survive an attack - but you'll need to be brave. Marine biologist Ryan Johnson said the worst thing to do when seeing those big pearly whites is to act like prey. ""If you act like prey, they are possibly going to treat you like prey. Don’t panic, don’t thrash, don’t try to get away,"" he said. ""You should hold your ground and 99.9% of the time you’ll have a wonderful time and then it’ll go on its way."" Ryan says as more underwater predators filter into UK waters as temperatures continue to rise, swimmers will need to get 'shark smart'. He said: ""It’s important everybody who goes into the water is educated about sharks. ""Then when they start turning up in strange places, we know how to react."" Meanwhile, Adventurer and TV star Bear Grylls spoke exclusively to The Sun to give his top tips on what to do if you come face-to-face with a shark. ""Most shark attacks are mistaken identity, or they think of something else. So if you see a shark make yourself visible, make yourself strong, make yourself not look like prey,"" he said. ""As soon as you start panicking and start thrashing in that water and sending off prey-predator signals that you are food and you're scared and you're weak - that's whether you're facing wolves or sharks. ""You know, the signal is a really dangerous signal. So if you're with a shark in the water, bags of confidence, swim, you know strong, swing, swim, stable. ""If it's coming for you, if it's looking like it's attacking, you go for it, dive towards, it be aggressive. Cause confusion in a shark's mind. Yeah, they're unlikely to attack - even Great Whites."" Bear went on to confirm that sharks ""don't want to eat you,"" but tend to confuse humans for prey. ""If they see you're human, and you're not scared, and you're swimming with it, they leave you alone."" WW2 sergeant Edgar Harrell told us he survived days in shark-infested waters off the Philippines by huddling together with his navy pals. The late US vet was on the USS Indianapolis in 1945 when it was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine. Harrell was floating with a group of roughly 80 other men when dorsal fins started to cut through the waves around them. The men clung to each other in a bid to intimidate the predators – but those weakened by injuries would lose their grip. And once alone in the open, the sharks would close in. Harrell says: ""You would hear a blood-curdling scream and look and see someone going under."" And as the victims' blood spread in the water, sharks – which can smell blood up to three miles away – were attracted to the defenceless sailors, creating a feeding frenzy. Harrell added: ""When you get some 900 boys out there decaying in misery, sharks are gonna swim through there and they’re gonna attack what’s in their road. ""If I’m flopping around in their road, they’re going to take me under, and they only have to hit you once. ""All we heard was men being eaten alive. Every day, every night.""

What is a Supermoon?,"SUPERMOONS rarely happen, but when they do, they create great scenery that you do not want to miss out on seeing. But you may be wondering how such phenomenon happen, and that is why here we tell everything you ever wondered about supermoons. The term Supermoon was first defined in 1979 by astrologer Richard Nolle. He explained that the phenomenon is “a new or full moon which occurs with the moon at or near (within 90 per cent of) its closest approach to Earth in a given orbit”. Based on Nolle’s theory, the moon would have to be around 226,000 miles away from the Earth to be considered ""super"". Because of its relatively close proximity to the Earth, the celestial body’s surface appears a lot bigger when a Supermoon occurs. Meanwhile, some describe this phenomenon as a Moon Illusion. The Moon appears 30 per cent brighter and 14 per cent larger than it actually is and it is an illusion because of our brain's inability to understand that the sky that we live under is a dome. The scientific event is fairly uncommon, as it can occur around every 14 lunar months or full moons. During the last such cycle, November 14, 2016, saw the most impressive Supermoon since January 26, 1948. It is estimated that this supermoon will not be exceeded until at least November 25, 2034. It is also estimated that the closes supermoon in this century will be on December 6, 2052. Even though a full moon is sometimes associated with madness and lunacy, there’s no evidence that it actually has any effect on humans. Despite this, a Supermoon is believed to have an impact on the Earth’s waters. When a full moon is closer to our planet, the tide levels are often higher. While there is no solid scientific evidence, some astrology boffins believe that a supermoon was responsible for tsunamis in Tohoku in 2011 and the Indian Ocean in 2004.   ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1870409/supermoon-explained/
What time can I see the supermoon in the UK tonight?,"SUPERMOONS happen when the Moon is full, and its orbit is closest to earth, making it appear larger than normal. But what time will you be able to see it in the UK tonight (July 13, 2022), and when will it happen again? Here's all you need to know. When you look up into the sky tonight, you may find yourself doing a double-take. Due to an effect called the Moon Illusion, the Moon will seem 30 per cent brighter and 14 per cent larger than when it's at its furthest point from Earth (also known as its apogee). The Moon will appear huge compared to the rest of the surrounding landscape, but this is an illusion, caused by our brain's inability to understand that the sky we live under is a dome. The supermoon will hit peak illumination at about 7.38pm BST on July 13, 2022, but the best time to see it will be following the moonrise at 9.47pm. The Met Office's latest weather forecast suggests Brits will have a clear sight of the phenomenon, with showers ""or occasional longer spells of rain in the north, dry with sunny spells elsewhere"". This strikingly enlarged Moon - or so it appears - will rise up from the east. If you're planning to observe it, it's therefore important you have a viewpoint that is east facing, and doesn't have any buildings or structures blocking your view. You won't need any specialist equipment as it will be clearly visible, though it may be worth getting a pair of binoculars if you want a clearer view of the lunar terrain. You will have to wait a while until experiencing yet another supermoon - until August 1, 2023 to be exact The supermoon that will be experienced tonight is called a Buck Moon or a Thunder Moon. The July supermoon follows on from the Strawberry supermoon, which took place on Tuesday, June 14, 2022. There is a full moon every 29.5 days - meaning there is one every month and sometimes two in a month. These are the full moons to look out for, and their (amazingly) specific timings: ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19170716/what-time-supermoon-uk/
Complete fossilised skeleton of gorgosaurus to fetch up to £7m at auction,"A COMPLETE fossilised skeleton of a cousin of T.Rex is expected to fetch up to £7million when it is sold at auction. The remains of a gorgosaurus — a top predator whose name means dreadful lizard — will go under the hammer this month.

New digital pound could be launched by Bank of England to use for everyday purchases,"A NEW digital pound could launch in future under plans being considered by the Bank of England.  It could allow households and businesses to use a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in stores and online. The Bank of England is discussing the use of a digital pound in the future after agreeing it might be necessary.  Both HM Treasury and the Bank have said a digital pound may help when prioritising the public's access to safe money. They also agree it could support private sector innovation, choice and efficiency in digital payments. It's been announced further research will take place and public opinion is now welcome. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt said: ""While cash is here to stay, a digital pound issued and backed by the Bank of England could be a new way to pay that’s trusted, accessible and easy to use. ""That’s why we want to investigate what is possible first, whilst always making sure we protect financial stability.” Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, added: “As the world around us and the way we pay for things becomes more digitalised, the case for a digital pound in the future continues to grow.  ""A digital pound would provide a new way to pay, help businesses, maintain trust in money and better protect financial stability."" A digital pound will always have the same value as cash, just replicated into digital format, accessed through digital wallets on smartphones or smartcards.  The Bank claims it would be widely available for use, risk-free, convenient and trusted. It claims the digital pound would be subject to rigorous standards of privacy and data protection too, and that neither the Bank nor the government would have access to personal data.  The idea is for it to be similar to a bank account. There may be initial restrictions on how much you can spend or hold at once, but that is still to be discussed.  However, the Bank has said there may be a limit at least in the introductory phase. The digital pound issued by the Bank of England would not be volatile, because it would come from a legislated organisation rather than a private sector. It's very important only to invest in a digital pound or any form of cryptocurrency if you understand it.  Remember, there's no guarantee you can convert cryptocurrency into real cash and investing is not a reliable way to make money.  That's because it can be highly volatile too - meaning your cash could soar or plummet at any given moment.  Online currency and decentralised finance is also very risky a lot of the time due to the prevalence of scams. For example, just over 7,200 reports of crypto scams were made to the FCA, the UK's finance watchdog, in the year leading up to June 30, 2022. It marks a staggering 45% increase over the previous year, in figures obtained by Capital Block.  Common ways to get scammed are: And keep in mind you won’t be able to take a complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service, because cryptocurrency firms are not regulated in the way others are.  There are lots of things to look out for but, most importantly, if something looks too good to be true it probably is.

Magistrates ordered to stop approving warrants to fit pre-payment meters amid energy crisis,"ENERGY firms face further scrutiny about their treatment of vulnerable customers in the wake of the pre-payment meter scandal. It comes as magistrates were yesterday ordered to stop approving warrants for pre-pay meters in England and Wales. The Government has given energy firms until today to report back on what action they will take and compensation they will give victims of forced installations.  An investigation by The Times last week found that debt agency workers for British Gas were breaking into vulnerable customers’ homes to fit meters. Being switched on to pre-payment meters means immediately facing higher energy costs, extra installation charges, and a struggle to pay off the debt of existing bills. Last year, courts approved more than 1,000 warrants a day for energy firms to force-fit meters. Magistrates can approve hundreds at a time in bulk within 15 minutes.  Ministry of Justice figures showed 32,790 warrants were issued in January alone.  Since the revelations, Ofgem has already told companies to suspend installing their meters. And one of the country’s most senior judges said that magistrates had to “act proportionately and with regard to the human rights of the people affected, [in] particular any people with vulnerability”. Lord Justice Edis said that no further warrant applications for installing energy meters should be filed until further notice. The revelations come as energy producers such as Shell, BP and British Gas owner Centrica are making record-breaking profits from soaring oil and gas prices. Households are falling behind on bills as rocketing energy costs are driving the cost-of-living crisis. Energy giants have repeatedly argued that they have looked after customers with hardship funds. However, the reality has been very different for the most vulnerable members of society, including those with disabilities who have returned home to find meters installed without their knowledge. The Business Select Committee will meet today to discuss allegations about energy firms’ behaviour. HOW can energy regulator Ofgem believe it is fit for ­purpose after it was in the dark about the scandal of forced pre-payment meter installations? Before The Times’s revelations, Ofgem boss Jonathan Brealey resisted the idea the watchdog should be tougher.  He told MPs last week it was the “day job of energy bosses to make sure they are looking after their customers”. So what’s Ofgem’s job? Business Secretary Grant Shapps has said regulators were “having the wool pulled over their eyes” by the energy firms. Damningly, Ofgem allowed firms to mark their own homework on looking after the most vulnerable.  As ever it will be the poorest who end up paying the price. UNILEVER’S decision to keep selling ice cream in Russia has boosted the Russian economy by £432million in the past year. This could fund Putin’s war with a new tank every day, a Sukhoi Su-25 fighter jet every week or a 122mm shell every minute, the Moral Rating Agency says. Unilever continues to sell Dove soap and Cornetto and Magnum ice creams through its Inmarko unit in Russia. The firm will reveal financial results this Thursday. Mark Dixon, founder of the MRA, said: “A Cornetto ice cream seems innocuous until you realise millions sold each day can quickly pay for the launch of a missile.” Outgoing Unilever boss Alan Jope has said it stayed in Russia to look after its 3,500 employees there. THE mini-budget meltdown last autumn was made even worse because of risky borrowing by pension funds, a House of Lords Committee has said. The sharp rise in interest rates and slump in government bonds forced funds to dump billions of pounds of assets to stay afloat.The chaos led the Bank of England to intervene in buying government bonds. The House of Lords said the Pensions Regulator required “greater control and oversight” over borrowing. INTEREST rates remain likely to rise again according to a Bank of England rate setter. Just days after the Bank hiked rates by another 0.5 per cent to 4 per cent Catherine Mann yesterday gave a speech saying the next interest rate move was “more likely to be another hike than a cut or hold”. Traders had started to bet that Britain was coming towards the end of rate rises as inflation was falling and central banks in the US and Europe were also slowing the pace of increases. The market reckons interest rates will peak at 4.25 per cent. That is a big jump from the last decade of very low interest rates but lower than earlier fears they would keep soaring to 6 per cent. Ms Mann said that the Bank needed to “stay the course” on raising rates to bring the rate of price increases back down to its 2 per cent inflation target. THE Bank of England is to introduce a “digital pound” which will work alongside cash and online payments. Nicknamed Britcoin, it will be launched in the second part of this decade as a way of preparing for the declining use of cash. Users of the coin will be protected by the Bank of England, so a digital £10 will be the same as £10 in cash. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: “A digital pound could be a new way to pay that’s trusted, accessible and easy to use.” DESPITE the high street’s December boom, retailers suffered the January blues. UK retail sales rose by 4.2 per cent in January, but this was below the three month average of 5.2 per cent, according to the British Retail Consortium. The BRC revealed sales volumes have almost halved in comparison to December. Their chief executive said: “Rises in bills and mortgages mean discretionary spending will remain weak.” BARCLAYS down 2.18 to 186.46 BP up 0.89 to 486.94 CENTRICA up 0.66 to 95.92 HSBC down 2.20 to 594.50 LLOYDS down 0.5 to 52.83 M&S down 158.96 to 4.04 NATWEST down 6 to 300.20 ROYAL MAIL down 2.40 to 234.7 SAINSBURY’S down 0.90 to 266.6 SHELL down 15.50 to 2,398.50 TESCOup 0.10 to 246.50 ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/21296897/warrants-pre-payment-meters-ruling/
What is Tyson Fury’s sports energy drink and where can I buy it?,"FANS have been flocking to buy the Prime hydration drink but Tyson Fury's own energy beverage is proving popular too. The heavyweight boxing champ launched his ""Furocity"" range early last year. But in the same year, YouTube boxing rivals-turned-business partners KSI and Logan Paul brought out Prime hydration. The beverage has sparked a craze in the UK, with fans scrapping to get their hands on a bottle and shops selling them for up to £100. But all was not lost, as Tyson's dad caused Furocity sales to jump by 300% after posting a scathing video of him reviewing a Prime drink. So what are Furocity drinks and where can you get them? We've got all the info below. WBC heavyweight champion Tyson launched his Furocity line in early 2022, striking an exclusive deal with Iceland. The drinks come with as much caffeine as two cups of coffee and come in four flavours. These are: Tyson has also launched ice sticks in the same flavour and chewing gum.  Packaging for Tyson’s drink has a shiny black and red design, with a photo of his face. It appears alongside the slogan: “Unlike my opponents, Furocity packs a real punch. ""It’s about hitting your day harder and making the moment count. It’s a feeling you can’t bottle. So I put it in a can.” Tyson's energy drink can be purchased from Iceland stores.  Of course, stock may vary depending on what options your local Iceland has but it is worth checking.  At the time of writing Iceland did have all flavours in stock online.  The drinks currently cost £1 at Iceland.  Iceland delivery has a minimum spend of £25 though, so you could pair the purchase with your weekly shop.  Or, if you're a big fan, you could buy 25.  You can also get them on Tyson's official merchandise website, though you can only buy them in packs of 12 for £16. Shipping costs £3. Since it launched, the drink has had mixed reviews online. Some fans love them, while others prefer the Prime drinks. One tweeted: ""Not sure if he helped create it or just putting his name to it but @TysonFury's Furocity black & blue raspberry is nicest energy drink around."" While another said: ""[Tyson Fury] has got one hell of a energy drink go try it its called Furocity."" But another clever shopper said: ""Oh dear Furocity Tyson Furys drink is already on the reduced bargain bin shelf in Iceland UK."" Do you have a money problem that needs sorting?

How much does it cost to run a heated clothes airer?,"HOUSEHOLDS are looking at alternative ways to dry their laundry this winter in a bid to slash energy bills. With energy costs high, tumble dryers are an expensive appliance to frequently rely on. Appliances like heated airers could make a big difference to your bills. They're cheaper than using a tumble dryer, according to experts - which is why they are becoming more popular with shoppers. Over recent months, shoppers have scrambled to buy bargain airers from places like Lidl and Aldi. But how much does it cost to run one, and how does it compare to a tumble dryer? We've worked out the costs so you can decide if it's the best option for you and how much to budget for with energy bills. Heated clothes airers are like traditional ones, but you plug them in. The bars of the dryer heat up, shortening the time it takes to dry the clothes hanging on it. You can buy covers for some as well, which speeds up the time it takes to dry your clothes. The cost of running a drier depends on the wattage. Generally, how much an appliance costs to run depends on how much you use it, what model you have and how much energy you normally use. But usually the higher the wattage, the more it will cost to run. A 300w airer uses 0.3 kWh - a kilowatt hour is the unit of energy used for billing your electricity. Based on the Energy Price Guarantee (EPG), running a typical heated airer for an hour costs 16p. So, if you had it on for eight hours, it would cost £1.28. But this will go up in April, when the EPG will be raised.  At this point, is expected that the average household energy bill per year will increase to £3,000. The cost of running an airer will depend on the model you've got.  For example, we tested how much it would cost to run a Lakeland 3-tier heated airer. Without the cover, the airer took around 20 hours to dry a full load of laundry.  Although it only costs 10.2p per hour to run, the long drying time meant it cost about £2.04 per load.  Two to three washes per week would cost around £112 over the winter. But with the cover, the drying time nearly halved to about 13 hours – meaning it cost just £1.33 per load or £73 over a winter. If you're on the hunt for a heated clothes airer, it's best to look around other shops first to make sure you aren't missing anything cheaper. The prices will vary depending on the model you have. For example, we previously covered this Aldi heated air dryer which only costs 6p to run. That means if you use Aldi's one three times a week and keep it on for four hours, that costs £9.36 over the year. This Lidl airer costs just 7p an hour to run and many are splashing out on the gadget, which costs £44.99 from the discount supermarket. You should also always check possible delivery costs and return policies. The price of running a tumble dryer depends on what type of machine you buy. But on average, Uswitch estimates a tumble dryer costs 85p to run per hour of use. This estimate is based on one using 2,500w. That means if you use it for two hours a week, you'll be paying £81.60 a year. We've listed the cheapest models to run. There are a number of ways you can reduce your bills for drying clothes. The most obvious way to save money is to hang them out instead of using a tumble dryer. It won't cost you a penny, but with temperatures dipping as autumn hits, keep in mind that getting your load dry could take longer. You could also save money on washing your clothes too by reducing the temperature you wash them at. If you're wondering how much a microwave costs to run, we've got you covered. We have revealed the full list of appliances and how much they cost to run from air fryers to dishwashers here. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/16324816/how-much-cost-run-heated-clothes-airer/
‘Blackout chaos’ warning as power grid workers threaten to strike over pay,"BRITS have been warned of the possibility of ""blackout chaos"" as power grid workers threaten to strike. Unite, the UK's second largest union, announced that around 1,300 UK Power Networks staff are being balloted over potential walk-outs, with a decision expected tomorrow. Industrial action could potentially lead to blackouts in the affected regions in March as striking workers would not be on hand to repair any unplanned outages, which the union said could cause ""chaos"". A Unite spokesperson told the Mirror: ""The workers maintain and repair the power network so if there’s an outage when the strikes are on there will be a delay in fixing it."" The union accused UK Power Networks, which operates electricity distribution across the South East and London, of ""rampant profiteering"" amid a cost of living crisis. They added that workers were angry that the company had offered them a below-inflation pay rise this year, despite being ""obscenely profitable"". UK Power Networks has reported profits of £2.4 billion since 2019. Sharon Graham, general secretary of Unite, said: ""UK Power Networks’ rampant profiteering when people’s homes are freezing due to astronomical energy bills is a perfect illustration of why the UK’s economy is broken.  ""And just because our members work on the power grid doesn’t mean they are exempt from the sky-high electricity bills that have helped plunge the country into crisis.  ""Putting forward a pay offer our members could accept would barely make a dent in UK Power Networks’ obscene profits. The company can afford to pay and must do so."" A spokesperson for UK Power Networks said: ""We have long supported our employees and recognise their key role in our success.  ""Most of our employees have received above inflation pay increases over recent years and a current formal offer tabled of around 18% (based on current forecast inflation rates) covering 2022/2023 has been made. Negotiations with Unite and our other recognised Trade Unions are ongoing. ""We hope to avoid strike action, however we are making plans to ensure our network remains resilient in the event Unite press ahead with strike action.""  Unite disputes the 18 per cent claim and says that a seven per cent rise was ""imposed"" on workers in the first year. Around 98 per cent of their members voted in a consultative to reject the deal offered by the company. Before a power cut there are a few things you can do to make sure you are equipped to deal with the dark times. You should make sure you have at least one torch in your house and spare batteries. Try to avoid candles if you can because they are a fire risk. External battery packs are also handy for charging your phone without relying on electricity. Make sure devices are fully charged and write down a list of important contacts in case your phone dies. Having some blankets and thick clothes ready to keep everybody in your household warm is also a good idea. Have a first aid kit handy too in case of an emergency. Make sure you know how to operate the manual release of your garage door, if you have one. It may also be a good idea to keep your car's petrol tank full as petrol stations rely on electricity to pump petrol. Have some cash handy too because all card machines work with electricity. If you rely on anything that requires batter power like a medical device, make sure you talk to your doctor about a back up plan. If you have a stair lift for example, you should have a back up battery Non-essential electronics should be unplugged or turned off at the wall to prevent damage in case of a surge when power returns.

Key supermarket rice item shrinks in size but prices remain the same,"A POPULAR supermarket item has shrunk in size but shoppers are still being charged the same prices. Pouches of Ben's original rice have shrunk from 250g to 220g to mitigate soaring costs. Mars, the manufacturer of Ben's rice, justified the move as it battles ""significant cost increases"". But it means that shoppers will be left paying the same price for less rice.  Food prices soared by 16.8% in the year to December, with basics such as milk, cheese and eggs seeing the largest increases. A spokesperson for Mars said: ""We have been absorbing these rising costs for some time, but the growing pressures we are facing mean more needs to be done. ""While it has been a difficult decision to decrease the weight of our ready-to-heat pouches, we believe we are still providing nutritious, great-tasting, quality products that offer value for money."" Manufacturers can't force retailers to lower their prices. Right now, Morrisons customers can get 250g packs of Ben's Basmati rice for £1. But the newer, smaller 220g pouches are also on sale for the exact same price. This means that if shoppers were to get hold of the remaining larger pouches they'd only fork out 40p per 100g, but if they were to get the new pouches it costs 45p per 100g. It's the latest example of something known as shrinkflation, which is when items shrink in size or quantity, while their prices remain the same or increase. Shrinkflation most commonly affects food and drink products - and it's an easy way for manufacturers to cut costs. Rising the price per given amount is a well-oiled strategy used by companies, mainly the food and beverage industries, to stealthily boost profit margins or to cement them in times of rising input costs. It is a form of hidden inflation as shrinkflation often goes unnoticed by customers. Companies run the risk of turning customers away from a product or brand if they do notice they are getting less for the same price. Other items recently affected by shrinkflation include bottled beers, frozen vegetables, cheese, tea and coffee. You can compare the prices of products across a range of supermarkets by using sites like Priceable and Trolly.co.uk. It's important to remember that prices can change from day to day if new offers come about if the supermarket raises prices - so take any prices you find online with a pinch of salt.  Research what you need before you go. Prices always vary by supermarket and it can pay to change up your shop. One shopper ditched going to supermarkets altogether in favour of their local wholesaler, that way they could stock up in bulk, at lower prices. You can also cash in on reduced foods like yellow sticker bargains - these will be items reduced because they're about to meet their best-before date. They'll still be safe to eat or freeze to make them last longer, but it means you can pick up the same products at an even cheaper price. Sometimes even timing your shop to stock up just as items are discounted on the shelves can help you get the best bargains - lots of shoppers have said this is in the evening typically. But being smart about how you shop isn't the only way to slash spending. Especially as prices continue to rise, there are schemes in place to help the most hard-up buy essentials.

Major supermarket to give kids free warm breakfasts this half-term,"A MAJOR supermarket is offering kids free warm breakfasts over the February half-term.  Asda will give children the cheap deals this month as families combat the cost of living crisis. From 8am to midday during half-term, kids can get a free bowl of Quaker porridge on top of any kids' main meal for £1. The current kids for £1 menu includes a choice of one of six hot meals or a cold pick and mix sandwich meals deal for just £1. The offer is available throughout February half-term and across all 205 Asda cafes. The dates are February 9 until February 22 to cover all variations of half-term holidays.   Kris Comerford, Asda’s chief commercial officer said: “We know when families are preparing for the school holidays it can often mean an additional strain on household budgets – especially feeding and entertaining their children. ""We remain as committed as ever to supporting our customers in tackling these tough times."" Sainsbury's has also confirmed that it'll be offering kids free hot meals or a lunch bag over half-term. Parents will just need to purchase any of the adult main meals for £5.20. The offer is available in all Sainsbury's cafes between February 13 and February 24. During term time, Sainsbury's is also offering kid's meals for £1 for every adult main purchased.  We've asked other supermarkets what they're doing for half-term and will update this piece once we hear back. The Range is also giving shoppers the chance to get a free breakfast. Two children under 16 per family can get a free warm breakfast  with every adult breakfast purchased.  Household Support Fund To help families juggle the cost of living crisis, many councils are offering free cash or supermarket vouchers through the Household Support Fund. The pot of money from Government has been shared between local councils. But each local authority decides how to allocate their portion of the fund so what you will get depends on where you live. In most cases, the help is given to households on benefits or a low income so check with your local council to see what it offers.  Healthy Start vouchers Struggling parents can also apply for Healthy Start vouchers.  Families that qualify for the Healthy Start scheme get one or two vouchers per week, per child, depending how old each child is. If you have a child that's younger than 12-months-old, you get two vouchers each week. That means in the first year of your child's life you could get £442. Pregnant women get one voucher a week, and parents also get one voucher for each child between one and four. That means they would get at least £221 in a year. Supermarket rewards schemes Most supermarkets have their own loyalty schemes which customers can sign up to to earn points and get discounts on products. Tesco offers personalised coupons to its loyal customers through its Clubcard scheme. Asda Rewards allows customers to collect ""Asda pounds"" every time they buy Star Products and complete Missions in store. Meanwhile, Sainsbury's revamped the Nectar loyalty scheme in 2019 to also offer personalised discounts. Customers can see the deals on the website or app each week, then collect the extra points if they buy the item in store or online. Morrisons shoppers can no longer collect points through the My Morrisons loyalty scheme after the scheme was overhauled in May 2021 and points collecting scrapped.

Exact dates millions of households will get up to £200 energy bill help this spring as payments start going out today,"MILLIONS of households can now get up to £200 as another form of energy bill support.  The Alternative Fuel Payment (AFP) scheme will reach roughly 2.5million households off the gas grid. The UK government has announced those who are eligible will get the £200 today, whilst businesses who are off the grid will get a separate £150 on March 10.  To be off the gas grid means you don't use mains gas. That means you'll only get the cash if you warm your home using alternative energy sources such as heating oil, biomass and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). It comes after Jeremy Hunt announced he would double the amount of support for those using alternative fuels to heat their homes from £100 to £200 in his Autumn Statement. More than 1.6million are thought to currently rely on heating oil, including those in rural homes. If this is you, you likely won't need to do anything. The £200 will be credited onto your electricity bill from today.  However, if you live in park homes or on static houseboats with no direct energy supplier, you'll need to apply through an online portal on the government website.  This hasn't launched yet, but should do later in the month. You'll just need to enter your household bank details into the portal, so have them handy. It should also provide a more detailed list of households needing to apply. You'll also need to do this if you're on the gas grid but without a gas connection and using alternative fuels as your main heating source. And if you're a business running off the grid, including shops, offices, libraries, schools, hospitals, factories and farms, you'll need to wait until March 10, although the £150 could arrive earlier.  You might need to apply on the portal for this too, so you'll need your Meter Point Access Number (MPAN) handy.  But instructions should become clearer on the portal this month. Minister for energy and climate Graham Stuart said: ""Our main energy bill support schemes have seen millions of homes and businesses across the country get much needed help to cover costs, with figures today showing nearly £3 billion in government support has been paid out to business to date. ""Now we’re getting support to those remaining few that are off the gas grid and most difficult to reach. ""I am determined to see households and businesses of all stripes protected from global pressures this winter – whether that’s those living in a houseboat, park home or operating a rural hospital or school."" If you're not eligible for the £200 or £150 for business, there's more you can receive.  For example, there's the £400 payment which has been split into six monthly instalments. Payments have been made since October, and the final payment will be made in March. For the majority of energy customers, their monthly bills are automatically discounted. However, households with traditional pre-payment meters are being sent vouchers to redeem at their nearest top-up point instead. Also, millions on benefits are in line for up to £1,350 in free cash from spring. The help is aimed to help soften the blow of high energy bills, food costs and other necessities. The first chunk of the £900 cost of living payment will be paid directly into claimants' accounts. Unlike last year's help, this cost of living payment will be paid in three, not two, instalments. More than eight million people will get the help directly to their bank accounts, and the £900 help will be paid over the financial year. And don't forget to keep checking your local council for the Household Support Fund scheme.  It's a £421million scheme which every local council in England has access to.  You may be eligible for a chunk of cash to go towards essential costs - so do check your council website when you can.

Thousands on Universal Credit could get £720 compensation after move from benefits left them worse off,"THOUSANDS of people on Universal Credit could get a share of £150million in compensation after moving from legacy benefits. Over 50,000 of those who've transitioned to Universal Credit are losing out on payments worth £720 a year on average. A legal battle revealed that many of those who transitioned from disability premiums to Universal Credit are those that have been left out of pocket. It comes after the court said that two severely disabled men were discriminated against by the Department for Work and Pensions last year. The pair who were transitioned from receiving disability premiums to Universal Credit were left £180 a month out of pocket. Both received severe disability premium (SDP) and enhanced disability premium (EDP) payments worth £178 a month prior to being transferred to UC in 2016 and 2017. Disability premiums are extra amounts of money added to other benefits including income support, jobseeker's allowance, and housing benefit. But the pair were automatically shifted onto UC after moving houses because the DWP considers this a change of circumstances. This is because Universal Credit is replacing legacy benefits and thousands of people have already been switched before the deadline of 2028. Even though the pair were reassured by the DWP that they would receive the same amount, they found that they were £178 a month worse off. They challenged the case in the high court in 2018 but the DWP only offered them £120 a month in compensation.  But they returned to the High Court last month which ruled in their favour. With the backing of their solicitor, the pair have now written to the government asking them to set out how thousands of others will be compensated. The claimant's solicitor Tessa Gregory said: ""The Court of Appeal’s latest ruling means the secretary of state has now exhausted all legal avenues open to her. ""She must take steps to remove the discrimination identified without delay by adopting provisions which reflect the actual loss severely disabled benefit claimants like our clients have suffered."" It's unclear how and if all 55,000 will be compensation and we've asked the DWP for its response.  Thousands of households on legacy benefits face being moved on to Universal Credit by 2028. Managed migration is the process of moving people over to Universal Credit. Everyone on five so-called legacy benefits will be moved over to Universal Credit by the end of 2024. This includes those on: And those on income-related employment and support allowance will be moved over by 2028. Households on legacy benefits can also be moved over to Universal Credit due to a change in circumstances - which are listed on the government website. It's estimated that 1.4million will be better off on Universal Credit. A further 300,000 will see no change to how much they get, while around 900,000 will be worse off under Universal Credit. Anyone worse off will get transitional payments to top up their income to the same amount - but only through managed migration. If you chose to move over and are worse off you won't get them, so you need to check carefully if you'll be better off and wait to be moved if not. A benefits checker can help you understand if you'll be better off or not. Using an online benefits calculator can help you compare and are free and easy to use from charities such as Turn2Us and EntitledTo, and it's also worth asking them for advice. Once you move over, you won't be able to go back to legacy benefits. If you do find you're better off on Universal Credit you can start making a claim straight away on the government website.

Popular fashion retailer gives urgent update about when all 170 stores will close forever,"A COLLAPSED fashion retailer has given a new update about the closure of its 170 stores.  The M&Co brand was bought by Yours Clothing last week after falling into administration in December. As the deal included just the brand, the 170 stores are set to close - and this process is expected to begin after the Easter weekend. Administrator Teneo said stores will continue to trade over the next few weeks. However, at least 20 stores have confirmed on Facebook that they'll be shutting from April. The exact dates each shop will close is yet to be revealed so it might be wise to return any items you have sooner rather than later. M&Co is currently accepting exchanges made on purchases in store.  Shoppers can exchange it for an item of the same value within 14 days of purchase.  However, the retailer is no longer accepting loyalty cards and vouchers.  M&Co has closed its loyalty scheme for any new customers and any future purchases will no longer qualify for loyalty points.   If shoppers have a gift voucher for the store, it must be used by Sunday, February 12.  M&Co will accept the full value of gift cards in store, provided the value of the gift card is no more than half the total price of items purchased.  No new gift cards are being sold, and no balances will be added to existing gift cards.  Unfortunately, the use of gift cards for online orders has been suspended. If you have any questions, you can contact M&Co by email at custor-services@mandco.com.  A spokesman from Teneo confirmed the sale of M&Co brand and intellectual property to Yours Clothing last week. The Peterborough-based group also owns menswear line BadRhino, womenswear retailer Long Tall Sally and maternity brand Bump It Up Maternity. It is currently running a closing down sale before the stores disappear.  Shoppers can get between 30-50% off sale online and up to 60% off in-store. Administrators at Teneo put the bust business up for sale with an auction deadline for interested buyers. They blame M&Co’s collapse on the sharp rise in costs while squeezed household budgets have also depressed sales.  Nearly 2,000 jobs are now at risk though we don't know for sure if and when redundancies will be made.  M&Co isn't the only store to go into administration and shut its shop doors. Stationery retailer Paperchase collapsed into administration this week after it failed to find a buyer. Supermarket giant Tesco quickly stepped up to buy rights to the brand, as they plan to sell Paperchase items in stores. When a business is liquidated, they will look to sell stock for as much as possible to pay back creditors. Stores may disappear off the high street within weeks but the process could take up to two months. Major burger chain Byron Burger also recently fell into administration and is set to close nine restaurants immediately. Further popular chains including Las Iguanas, Cafe Rouge and Bella Italia also fell victim to the pandemic. In December 2022, pub chain Wetherspoons announced it would be closing a total of 39 pubs after being hit by soaring inflation. While H&M also announced it would be shutting a handful of its stores. H&M has closed branches in recent months, with more to follow this year. H&M has confirmed to The Sun that two branches in Hartlepool and Isle of Wight are set to close.

I was told my business was ‘worthless’ on Dragons’ Den – I’ve now sold it for £12million,"AN entrepreneur who got rejected from Dragons' Den has now sold his company for £12million.  Rob Law has passed on Trunki, which makes kids' suitcases, to e-commerce brand Heroes for a hefty price tag. Law initially appeared on Dragons' Den in 2006 at 28 years old, asking for a £100,000 investment in exchange for 10% of his business.  But he got turned down after one of the Dragons broke the handle off a suitcase, calling it ""worthless"". At the time, investor Theo Paphitis lashed out, saying: ""You shouldn’t come here with problems that can be solved.  ""It drives me mad that we waste our time with these things."" Afterwards, Law grew the business himself, selling over three million suitcases in over 100 countries by 2016. Now, after 16 years and selling five million suitcases worldwide, it will be headed by e-commerce platform Heroes, which takes care of youth and maternity brands.  Alessio and Riccardo Bruni, Heroes co-founders, said: “We are extremely excited for Trunki and the team to join the Heroes family and embark on the next journey together.  ""The acquisition will further strengthen our core focus in the baby and children category and gives us further expansion into retails and worldwide distribution”. Rob Law, Trunki founder and chief executive, added: ""It became apparent after the first few discussions that Heroes was the right buyer for Trunki.  ""The Bruni brothers’ vision for the brand was far more ambitious and creative than what other buyers presented. ""Whilst Trunki has been around for over 16 years, we couldn’t be more excited for the next chapter of our journey”. Founded during the pandemic, Heroes now heads over 35 brands, including the Boba baby carrier and Onco baby car mirror, and has 120 employees.  Trunki first landed a contract with John Lewis to sell the bags, which are now also sold across the UK in stores including Boots, Argos and Amazon. All the products are designed in England before being distributed worldwide. You can catch the latest episodes of Dragons' Den on BBC One. Most recently, the dragons meet 18-year-old Myles Dickinson-Brown, who's the youngest candidate to make £124k in profit from his business.  Starting your own business can be quite intimidating, but there are top tips to note down for an easy launch. First of all, it's important to be organised. So make a business plan.  Consider what your business is for and what differentiates you from the rest of the market as well as the costs and how much money you could make. This is helpful so you know what you are working towards and also can be used if you are applying for a loan. Secondly, make sure you know the two main business types - limited company and sole trader.  A limited company is a registered business that is legally separate from you as an individual. This means if your business gets into legal or financial trouble, your personal assets such as your family home cannot be put a risk. Running a company has extra responsibilities such as completing company accounts. In contrast, a sole trader only has to complete a self-assessment tax return each year. There are tax differences as well - you can read up on what these are on websites such as TaxAssist and Simply Business. Also make sure you have enough funding to start a business and you may need to set up an online and social presence too. Elsewhere, it's been revealed Revolution Beauty founders gave loans to distributors in return for bumping up orders. Around £9million of sales should not have been counted, says a report. Founders Adam Minto and Tom Allsworth made fortunes when they listed the firm for £500million in 2021. But they did not tell the rest of the board about the secret deals which gave the impression that Revolution’s business was bigger than it is. Auditors had refused to sign off the accounts, which prompted a months-long probe. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/21287245/business-worthless-dragons-den-sold/

List of major chains set to disappear from the high street this year as more retailers shut branches,"MAJOR retailers are shutting up shop across hundreds of UK high streets. Some 15,000 stores are expected to close this year, according to the Centre for Retail Research. The mass retailer exodus includes hundreds of stores operated by popular household names - including Paperchase and M&Co. Retailers are feeling the pinch due to high inflation, which was sitting at 10.5% in December. Although that's down from November's rate of 10.7%, it's still five times higher than the Bank of England’s target of two per cent. High inflation causes a squeeze on people's incomes - meaning many are forced to shop less. Combined with high energy costs and a shift to shopping online after the pandemic - many high street shops have struggled to keep open. Energy and fuel costs have all been hit by a pandemic hangover, the war in Ukraine and a shortage of essential workers which has put immense pressure on businesses. Here's a full list of retailers affected by soaring costs. Boots has confirmed it will be closing three stores in the UK this spring. The stores are located in: Boots has confirmed these closures were pre-planned and no other branches are known to be shutting. The chain has over 2,200 stores across the UK. H&M has started closing branches across the UK as high street retail struggles. The clothing brand's closures include branches in Burton and Maidenhead. It's also confirmed another two closures will happen in Hartlepool and Isle of Wight. These closures will be permanent. The pharmacy chain is withdrawing its services from hundreds of Sainsbury's stores. Lloyds outlets will close across 237 Sainsbury's branches, the supermarket said. Sainsbury's struck a deal to sell its pharmacy business to Lloyds Pharmacy in 2015 for £125 million. At the time it meant around 2,500 Sainsbury's pharmacy staff transferred to Lloyds. But Lloyds Pharmacy has now confirmed all its Sainsbury's pharmacies will stop operating - but it's unclear when this will take place. The retailer, previously called Mackay’s fell in to administration for the second time in two years at the start of December. Administrators at Teneo put the bust business up for sale with an auction deadline for interested buyers. And while the M&Co brand has been bought by Yours Clothing, the stores haven't. An insider source also told The Sun that the sale of the brand means M&Co's 170 shops will close forever, putting 1,910 jobs at risk. Although no store closures are officially confirmed for Paperchase, the company started lining up administrators. The business was in talks to secure a pre-pack administration deal. However, Tesco saved the stationery chain's brand last week but hundreds of branches will still close. We've listed all the Paperchase stores at risk of permanent closure. Argos will be shutting all of its stores in the Republic of Ireland this year. The chain has roughly 580 staff members in 34 stores across the country. The closures will happen by June 24, but no other UK stores will be affected.  The company said it found that the investment required to develop and modernise the Irish part of its business was “not viable”. You can read about where all the Argos branches in Ireland are in our guide. Argos is owned by major supermarket Sainsbury's. It comes as Sainsbury's announced recently that Lloyd's Pharmacy is withdrawing its services from over 200 Sainsbury's stores.

How to get a McDonald’s Big Mac and fries for £1.99 every time,"MCDONALD'S fans can get their hands on a big mac for £1.99 with a simple code. Hungry diners simply need to fill out a quick survey feedback survey after a previous visit to the fast food chain to redeem the offer . The trick will come in handy during a crippling cost of living crisis, with budgets tight. McDonald's also raised prices last year, so any money knocked off your bill will be good news for shoppers. All you need is an old McDonald's receipt from a previous trip no longer than 60 days ago. Or you can buy a cheap item from the menu if you don't have an old receipt handy. Don't forget to print your receipt if you order from a self-service kiosk. A 12 digit code will be printed on the proof of purchase, and you can enter this McDonald's Food for Thought website to need to fill out a quick survey regarding your recent trip. You'll then receive a five digit code which is your voucher for the £1.99 offer, so jot it down. This five digit code can be used in any McDonald's branch to get a Big Mac and fries for £1.99. Otherwise it costs around £5.29 so you can save £3.30 with the lesser-known rewards offer - roughly half price. If a Big Mac isn't your thing, you can choose a Fillet-O-Fish, or Vegetable Deluxe instead, and you can swap out the fries for a side salad if you prefer. Either combination will still only cost £1.99 with the code. There is no minimum spend required to get the 12 digit code, so technically you could buy the cheapest thing on the menu and still get the discount. Customers can use the offer multiple times but each code only redeems one Big Mac and fries so you'll need a different receipt each time. The fast food giant also said the codes can be tracked to avoid fraudulent activity, so you can’t just write five random numbers on your receipt. You have 60 days from receiving a receipt to claim your voucher, after that you'll need a new receipt with a fresh 12 digit code. Once you've got your five digit code, you'll be issued a new personal expiration date to use it by. Just remember to ask for the receipt and keep it safe as you won't be able to claim the deal without it. McDonald's has brought back the popular McSpicy burger as part of a menu shake up. But that means fans can no longer order the Big Tasty burger or Creme Egg McFlurry, which have been axed. If you fancy a Maccies breakfast, find out what time the fast food chain switches to its lunchtime menu. No. Even though McDonald's took the decision to hike the prices of several items by 20p last year, the Big Mac trick still works. The fast-food chain hiked the price of the much loved cheeseburger from 99p to £1.19, for example. The price increases also affected the cost of a McFlurry and McNugget sharebox.

Full list of mobile networks that don’t require financial checks – how to get connected with poor credit,"THOUSANDS of people get rejected from taking out mobile contracts every year. This is because taking out a new phone contract is a form of borrowing. Mobile networks run hard credit checks to make sure customers can afford to meet their monthly bill payments. This is bad news for those who have a poor credit history or low credit score. This could be from having little previous history of borrowing, or marks on your record from missed payments, for example.  Those with a poor credit history needn't miss out though, as there are a number of mobile networks that don't run credit checks. Rehan Ali, Uswitch mobile expert said: ""Taking out a mobile phone contract is a form of credit and therefore providers will often require you to pass a credit check before they give you a contract. ""However, with the cost of living crisis putting added pressure on credit ratings, securing a mobile phone deal with a poor credit history could be a common problem for many."" “If you do have a poor credit history and are in the market for a new mobile phone deal, there are a number of ways you can still acquire a good deal."" One way is to make sure you're network savvy. There are four major mobile networks in the UK - EE, O2, Three and Vodafone - all of which run hard credit checks when you apply for a new contract. If your credit file is already poor, applying for a contract with these firms could put a further mark on your file, potentially reducing your credit score further if your application is rejected. But a number of smaller networks which ""piggyback"" off the bigger player's signal don't run any checks. Here's a full list of these networks that don't require you to pass a credit check to be accepted for their 30-day sim-only deals. These deals come with calls, messaging and data allowances for a monthly fee, but not the handset. As you won't be paying off the cost of the phone itself, they can also work out cheaper if you already have a device. Remember to check different deals to find the best price. You can use comparison sites and directly with providers as they may not always be listed on them. Plus you can use the signal checker tool on Ofcom's website to see if you get the coverage you need from the network where you are. GiffGaff runs off O2's network and customers wishing to take out a new sim-only deal won't face a credit check. All deals come as a 30-day rolling contract and customers are able to cancel this at any time without an extra fee. Right now, customers can get unlimited UK calls and texts, free EU roaming and 5GB of data for just £8 a month. Lebara runs off the Vodafone mobile network but customers don't face any credit checks when applying for a sim-only contract. Contracts last on a 30-day rolling basis and customers can cancel with 30 days' notice without facing exit fees. Right now, customers can get unlimited UK calls and texts and 15GB of data for just £10 a month. Like other smaller networks, Lyca Mobile's sim-only deals work on a rolling prepaid basis. This means that customers don't need to pass any credit check when signing up. Right now, new customers can pay just £1 a month on a rolling basis for three months, rising to £5 thereafter and get 6GB of data and free roaming in the EU. Lyca Mobile runs off O2's network coverage. Smarty runs off Three's mobile network but customers don't face any credit checks when taking out a new sim-only deal. Right now, customers can get unlimited UK calls and texts and 24GB of data for just £8 a month. And subject to Smarty's fair usage limit, you can use up to 12GB of data each month out of your monthly allowance when travelling in the EU.  iD Mobile runs off Vodafone's network but customers don't face credit check when signing up to a new sim-only deal. Right now, customers can get unlimited UK calls and texts and 250GB of data for just £14 a month. All iD Mobile plans also come with inclusive EU roaming. Unlike the plans offered by the four major mobile networks, customers have less choice when it comes to sim-only deals. Those with these tariffs also miss out on exclusive additional subscriptions and promotions offered by larger network sim-only deals offered  For example, O2 offers up to six months of free Apple Music on some of its tariffs. And Vodafone offers some customers a 24-month subscription to Spotify Premium included in their sim-only deal. Paying for poor credit sims also won't help you improve your credit rating because these providers don't report payments to credit reference agencies. Find out how you can boost your credit score with nine simple steps. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/21254228/full-list-mobile-networks-dont-run-credit-check/
I went to UK’s only charity shop department store & saved £285 on one item – here’s where to find it,"THE UK’S only charity shop department store opened just last week - and savvy Brits have already saved big. CharitySuper.Mkt has launched in north London shopping mall Brent Cross and thrift fans say it is shopping heaven. Ten charities feature in the store: TRAID, Havens Hospice, Barnado’s, Shelter, Cancer Research, Age UK, Marie Curie, Emmaus, SCT and All Aboard. And one savvy shopper this week saved a whopping £285 on just one item. Writer Alexandra Bullard says after digging through piles of garments, a black blazer from L. K. Bennett caught her eye. She snapped it up for just £14.99 - compared to the online price of £300. And that’s not the only bargain she landed. She wrote in MyLondon: “I also spotted a gorgeous leopard print dress from Ralph Lauren for only £12, and saw a yellow Polo Ralph Lauren hoodie for only £33.  “This is thrifting at its finest.” The charity shop department store is only open until Saturday February 25. It comes after we told how shoppers at one of the UK's most-expensive charity shops can browse through racks of designer clothes, with some costing a whopping £500. Labels such as Armani and Chanel hang on the railings at the high-end thrift shop. The budget-busting Mind store, nestled in London's trendy Soho, even boasts a plush dressing room. Luxury brands found at the charity shop - which supports mental health patients - is a world away from the usual M&S and Peacocks clobber in most stores of its type. The shop had a £195 yellow jacket by Sies Marja for sale. But the most expensive was a leather skirt by Chanel that will set you back a whopping £495, MyLondon reports. A charity shop expert also revealed their insider secrets for getting the best bargains to The Sun. Ross Dutton said as a rule of thumb, the posher the area, the better quality the clothes that are donated. The charity shop manager said you should also snap up items you like when you see them. ""Most items in our stores have no more than a two week shelf life so you can’t hang around,"" he said. Cut-off labels could also be a dead give away that an item is completely unworn and from top high street brands. They often have deals with local charity shops to get rid of unsold end of season items, as long as they remove the labels - they are  donated straight from the shop floor. You don't even have to leac your home in some cases spot the best deals, Ross says. While some charities have their own site, like Oxfam and Crisis. many also sell from dedicated eBay stores, such as British Heart Foundation and Scope. Meanwhile we spoke to one Dad who makes £500 a month from his charity shop side hustle. Luke Hadley told The Sun how he picks up bargain finds from charity shop and sells them for a profit on eBay.

Collection of more than 400 Star Wars toys kept in a cupboard for 40 years sells for eye-watering sum,"A COLLECTION of more than 400 Star Wars toys in their original packaging has sold for £622,000. They were stored in a cupboard for 45 years and included five of the rare Luke Skywalker figures with a double telescopic lightsaber. This early Jedi weapon was quickly replaced with a single telescopic piece of plastic by toy firm Kenner because it was too complicated. One of them alone sold for £34,680 in the auction in Pennsylvania, USA. There were eight Boba Fett figures, one of which sold for £10,898.  And a box of 24 unopened Yodas sold for £18,360. The seller, now in his 70s, had bought multiple copies direct from Kenner so his kids could play with some while others were stored. Chuck Lang, for Morphy Auctions, said: “There was a lot of buzz in the Star Wars collecting world over this, the quality of it is just incredible. ""Seeing it now is like being transported back to a toy shop in the late 1970s. Whatever Star Wars you would have wanted at the time is there.

Big change to train tickets planned – and it could end up costing you more,"A SHAKE-UP to the way we buy our tickets could mean we pay more to travel. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has given the green light to scrap return tickets. A new system of ""single-leg pricing"" will be introduced according to The Telegraph. The change means that two single tickets will equal a return. Passengers will no longer be able to buy return tickets once the change comes in. Instead, they will buy two single tickets. The government hasn't revealed how the change will affect prices but it could mean people end up paying more.  This of course, will depend on the travel provider, journey and distance.  Mark Smith, travel expert and creator of cheap train ticket finder Seat61 told The Sun that the amount of train operators in the UK makes it hard for online ticket retailers to present a clear choice of fully-flexible, off-peak and advance-purchase fares for an outward and inward journeys. ""It makes it harder to present fares in a simple way on ticket machines, and harder to implement effective contactless 'touch in, touch out' systems. ""It also penalises people making open-jaw or circular journeys rather than simple returns."" He said the government should now deliver three things: Transport secretary Mark Harper will announce the changes next week.  The move comes as part of a plan to manage the crisis within the transport network.  Many Brits across the country will be left without any services as members of Aslef and the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) unions walked out last week as part of a long-running dispute over pay and conditions. It was the second strike by train drivers last week, after they took part in the huge day of industrial action on Wednesday, which also involved teachers, university staff, civil servants, bus drivers and security guards. The latest round of talks between union bosses and train operators has seen a significant increase to the offer put on the table. Previously, an offer of a 4% payrise over two years was suggested. However, on January 17, 2023, the RDG (Rail Delivery Group) made its ""best and final offer"" to the RMT leadership. This offer includes a pay rise of 4% from January 2023. and 5% (or minimum £1,750 rise) backdated to January 2022. The deal includes changes to work practices. This offer comes after the January 6, 2023, offer from RDG to Aslef of 4 plus 4 per cent rise backdated to 2022. It includes no compulsory redundancies until March 31, 2024. It is thought that the strikes have had significant cost to the industry as a result. Do you have a money problem that needs sorting?

Thousands of hard-up families can get up to £650 in free cash – how to claim,"HARD-UP families can struggling with rising costs could get up to £650 free cash. The support comes via the Household Support Fund (HSF) which is worth £421 million. The pot of money from Government has been shared between local councils. But each local authority decides how to allocate their portion of the fund so what you will get depends on where you live. In most cases, the help is given to households on benefits or a low income. For example, residents in Manchester could get up to £650 in free cash - but they only have until March 31 to apply.  How much you get depends on your circumstances. You'll get up to £650 if you: You'll get £400 if you: You'll get £324 or £326 if you: If you think you qualify you'll need to apply via the Manchester City Council website - just search Household Support Fund.  You'll then get the payment into your bank account.  Yes you can. But each council has been given a different amount through the Household Support Fund. That means households are receiving different amounts depending on the area. The money is being distributed in different ways too - some councils are giving out supermarket vouchers while others are paying the money directly into people's bank accounts. Households in Luton can get up to £500 in free supermarket vouchers. Meanwhile, thousands in Exeter have just days left to apply for up to £650 of support. How you apply depends on where you live. In some cases residents are being asked to apply directly on council websites. But you might be able to call through and apply too. The best thing to do is get in touch with your local council to see if you're eligible and how to apply. If you don't know what council area you fall under you can use the locator tool found on the Government's website. Just type ""find my local council"" into Google and it should be the first link that appears on the page. Once you've clicked through you just have to enter your postcode and the tool tells you what council area you fall under. If you are not eligible for the Household Support Fund you might be able to get help through different means. Lots of energy companies offer grants to customers who are struggling with bills, including British Gas, EDF and E.On. In some cases, you might be able to get up to £1,500 worth of help, so it's worth seeing if you're eligible. The best thing to do is contact your supplier to see what they have on offer. Millions of households should be in the process of receiving the £400 energy rebate as well. Two payments worth £66 were paid in October and November and a third of £67 in December. The remaining three payments worth £66 will be paid in January, February and March. As part of the Autumn Statement, a second round of cost of living payments was announced too. This includes a £900, £300 and £150 payment. It's not yet clear who is eligible for each of the payments, but the dates for all three have been announced.

I spent £665.50 on a burger and chips from a fast food van – it’s taking weeks to get my money back,"A MAN has been left stunned after accidentally spending £665.50 on a burger and chips - facing a nightmare process lasting weeks to get his cash back. Toby Wilson, 35, unknowingly spent the whopping sum on the veggie burger and chips meal on his way home from a night out. The burger should have cost just £6.50 at food truck Efe's Kebab Kitchen. But Toby only clocked the huge miscalculation of more than £600 when he checked his account balance days later to find it had dropped ""significantly"".  And when the HR manager approached business owner Ahmed Abdullah about his huge card payment, he said the vendor told him to seek a refund through his bank. Business owner Ahmed Abdullah says he has now agreed to repay the cash - but Toby was left fuming over the month-long nightmare process to get his money back. Toby said at the time, what started off as a ""funny"" saga has now caused him unending weeks of ""stress"". He said: ""It's very frustrating. Admittedly, at the start, it was a bit of a funny story. I thought it would be quickly sorted out and the banks would go, ""Yep, it's an error."" ""But the bank is very slow at doing things. They said, ""have you got a receipt?"" The human aspect of it is I don't. No one has a receipt for things like that. ""I have a mortgage and bills to pay. It is just very worrying. The point is the money is mine, and it's a significant amount."" Business owner Ahmed Abdullah told a local paper at the time that he had wanted Toby to talk to his bank for safety reasons, adding: ""This is the legal way"". Toby, from Manchester, said he'd travelled to York to see friends just before Christmas last year and had purchased the pricey meal at around 11 pm. He said: ""I was out on December 23 for a sort of friends reunion. We all live in different parts of the country but go back to York. We do it every year."" Toby added alcohol wasn't to blame for the mistake: ""I am a non-drinker. Maybe it would be different if someone was drunk and just stumbled into to get a kebab and got it all wrong. But that's very much not the case. ""I just ordered a veggie burger and chips, and I looked at my bank balance a couple of days later, and I was like: ""What's going on? It's significantly lower."" ""It was like: ""No way, this can't be real!"" Toby asked a friend in York to visit the kebab van and ask the owner if they wouldn't mind refunding him the extra £660 he'd paid. But after the pair began exchanging texts, Toby claims Mr Abdullah didn't refuse to send him the money - he instead told him to speak to his bank, leading to the stalemate. Toby said: ""Being a large conglomerate, they have rules to follow and things like that. ""I explained the story to them, and they essentially need him to say ""Yes, it's happened."" ""I've worked in hospitality, so I know how these things work. I know he'd be able to see it in his accounts and what that transaction would relate to. ""It wouldn't relate to anything, because I didn't pay £666.50 for a veggie burger. He would be able to see that."" Toby is still stunned he managed to spend hundreds on a meal that should have cost him just a few pounds. He explained, exasperated: ""Sometimes I still look it now and think ""Was it definitely that?"" I look at the bank transfer, and it's got the name of his business.

He added: ""If it was £50, I might be able to go, ""You know what, just keep it, I'm not bothered with the stress"" But it's a lot."" Mr Abdullah said after the event he was speaking to his card machine company to see if they could provide proof £666.50 of Toby's money had gone into his account. He said: ""I'm talking to them to prove that the money is in my account or not. If they prove it, or if they don't prove it, I'm going to tell him."" Owner Mr Abdullah says he has now agreed to repay Toby Wilson back the £660 he mistakenly overspent for his veggie burger and chips meal after confirming that the money had reached his account."" He added: ""They say the customer needs to send me his details, or he can come with his bank card to the business."" If you want to return a product, there are laws that can protect you.

Argos shoppers rushing to buy air fryer that makes the ‘perfect’ food every time,"ARGOS shoppers have been raving about an air fryer that cooks the ""perfect"" food every time.  The Instant 4-in-1 3.8L Air Fryer is currently being sold online for £75. It comes with removable dishwasher parts with the options to air fry, bake, roast and reheat food.  And Argos shoppers have been raving about the air fryer. One happy customer said: ""Bought this last week,only regret is I didn't get one sooner!  ""Perfect food every time."" While another said: ""Much less hassle than using the oven.  ""I can cook everything for a full English, (except eggs and tomatoes), in half the time with half the mess."" Another shopper added: ""Very happy with air fryer, easy to use and powerful for great price."" These cooking gadgets make cooking easy, use less oil, and can help you cut back on your energy bills. For example, this Argos air fryer uses 1650 kilowatts per hour.  Based on that and the current energy price cap, it costs just 28p to run for half an hour. You'll be paying £8.40 if you used it every day for a month or £102.20 if you used it every day for a year.  Bear in mind that this will vary from house to house.  However, while it isn't as expensive as the famous Ninja air fryers, it is one of the more expensive ones we've seen.  If you're after something cheaper, Asda shoppers can get their hands on a slightly smaller 1.5ltr air fryer for £28. But be aware that if you order this product online you'll be charged a £2.95 delivery fee. Those looking for an air fryer with a much bigger capacity can get a 6.7ltr gadget from Costco for just £54.99. But be aware that not everyone will be able to pick up the bargain fryer as it's only available to Costco members. Of course, do shop around for the best products and deals as we may have missed something. Before you buy, it would be useful to work out how much it will cost to run - so make sure you know the watt power.  Do you have a money problem that needs sorting?

My make-up side hustle is set to make thousands this year – here’s how,"A WOMAN has made thousands from her makeup side hustle - here's how you can do the same. Zoe Trigwell's business skyrocketed in the last year after her powder puff product went viral online while it has also been used by celebrities 29-year-old Zoe quickly became TikTok famous after changing the everyday makeup routine for thousands of people. The viral ""TikTok made me buy it"" product aims to minimise the appearance of pores and shine.  It has been praised by fans as a “miracle product” after leaving users feeling airbrushed. And the powder puff is even used and recommended by the likes of US music star Lizzo's makeup artist. Having been in the makeup industry for more than eight years, Zoe launched her new business venture during the pandemic with the last of her savings.  Zoe told Wales Online: ""I always wanted to start a makeup brand and I thought: 'Now is the perfect opportunity to do this.' I had so much time so I thought: 'Now let's just go for it."" During lockdown Zoe decided to close her makeup training academy and her family were living off 80% of her husband’s income.  She said: “It was the last bit of money we had and we did have big arguments about it but now it’s paid off. I’m a true believer that you have to go for it and take risks to have that payoff."" Under Trigwell Cosmetics Zoe first launched 1,000 sets of false eyelashes called 'harmony lashes' in May 2020.  She added: “I already had a good following on social media and a nice community where I had been doing makeup for such a long time. ""I just promoted it to my clients in and around south Wales. We sold out within three to four days, which was absolutely amazing at the time – I couldn’t believe it.” The idea to bring the powder puff back as a makeup staple came to Zoe in 2021 and she launched her new product on March 31, 2022.  After seeing ""the cheap as chips"" powder puffs that were available on the market Zoe decided that she could ""improve"" the product.  Since launching the microfibre powder puff her once-small business went viral leading to thousands of orders over night. Almost a year later her business has skyrocketed and she now has a team of seven. Zoe said: “It’s crazy because no one was really using them and now the whole of the beauty community use a powder puff in their makeup routine – it’s mind-boggling. ""It changed my life completely – it went from zero to 100 really quickly. Until early August last year it was just myself running the business from my garage and house.  ""I’ve gone from just myself to now a team of seven and into a warehouse within the space of three to four months. Financially the business is more stable and I’m able to buy large amounts of stock. ""My partner has just quit his job to come to work for the business, which for us is incredible. It's a huge decision as we have two young boys but it means we’re more flexible with our time if one of us needs to look after the kids and for family time."" Zoe said their best financial month was in November 2022 as the company turned over six figures, which she said was ""absolutely incredible"".  She added: ""We’re set to turn over £1m this year. It’s crazy to me because we were in a totally different position six months ago so the business has skyrocketed."" The tipping point in the business came in June 2022 when Zoe would hope for 100 orders a week but soon turned into thousands.  She added that was the point that she needed to invest in staff as she ""couldn't keep doing all-nighters trying to pack them”. Zoe said she and her team have big plans for 2023 and hinted that she is working on three new products with one set to go hand in hand with the powder puff.

Martin Lewis warns millions of Tesco customers need to take urgent action now or they’ll lose Clubcard points,"MILLIONS of Tesco customers could lose their Clubcard points if they don't take action now warns Martin Lewis. The MoneySavingExpert.com (MSE) founder reminded shoppers in his weekly newsletter that £16million in Clubcard vouchers will expire this month.  It means that over two million customers could be at risk of losing their vouchers if they don't use them by 11:59pm on February 28. The vouchers, which were first issued in February 2021, will expire on February 28 and will help households up and down the UK. Customers can use vouchers in-store and online to knock money off their weekly shopping bill or cut the cost of filling up their car with fuel - or swap them for rewards worth more. Alternatively, Tesco customers could extend the use of vouchers they have earned through the Clubcard loyalty scheme. The MSE experts explained how to avoid losing points.  Just make a small purchase on the Tesco Clubcard Rewards website and you'll get the remaining points credited back to your account. For example, you could get a 50p voucher to spend at restaurants like Hungry Horse pubs, Zizzi or Cafe Rouge. It'll give you £1.50 to spend at your chosen location, as the rewards are worth three times as much as the voucher value. Note that you'll need to do this for each individual voucher though, so weigh up if it's actually worth it for smaller denominations.  If you've a £10 voucher it's probably worth it – if you've got a handful of £1 vouchers, maybe less so. The Sun first reported the Tesco Clubcard points warning last month.  You can view your statement - and see how many points you have - in the Tesco Clubcard app. Just head to your account and select statements.  Tesco’s Clubcard was launched in 1995, allowing shoppers to earn points as they shop which can then be turned into vouchers for money off food or other partner schemes.  Each time you spend £1 in store and online, you get one point when you scan your card or app. You also get one point for every £2 spent on fuel. One point equals 1p, so 150 points gets you £1.50, for example. You'll need a minimum of 150 points to request a voucher. Once you have enough points, you can turn them into vouchers worth the face value to spend in store at Tesco, or you can triple their worth to spend at reward partners, including restaurants, and on days out. Clubcard holders also get cheaper prices on some items compared to those without the loyalty card. For more loyalty schemes, you can read a full list and our verdict over which ones are worth it here. Do you have a money problem that needs sorting?

People think black coal is if you’ve been naughty… but it changed my life forever thanks to £1m EuroMillions lottery,"THIS lottery winner believes a piece of ""lucky"" black coal brought him his whopping £1million win. John Edmond from Edinburgh was given a lucky piece of coal by his grandad - which changed his life forever.  John, his wife Amanda and their two daughters were delighted with the win, and praised the lucky black coal for altering the family's fortune. John said after his big win: “My grandad used to have a piece of coal he said was lucky – he used it as a paper weight for his lottery tickets before he passed away. He gave it to me and said it might bring me luck, which it did!” The Edinburgh roofer, who scooped up his prize back in 2015,  said he arranged the “trip of a lifetime” to the Maldives for his family. John won the huge sum as well as the dream holiday in the EuroMillions Mega Friday draw. John said at the time: “This is absolutely life changing for us and neither Amanda nor I slept a wink on Saturday night when we realised we had won the money and the holiday.” “Going to somewhere like the Maldives could only have been a dream ambition up to now, but this allows us to give ourselves and our two girls the trip of a lifetime and we will try and get it all arranged soon.” What's more, the win allowed the family to move to a larger home and upgrade their car.  John revealed: “We can move out of our current two-bedroomed house, where the girls share a room, into one where they will each have their own bedroom and that again was only an ambition until now.  ""We will also be looking to upgrade our old 10-plate Nissan Qashqai now we have the means to do so.” John has worked as a roofer since he was 16 and planned to carry on working - although he said his wife Amanda was likely to give up her job as a therapist. John said: “Working is all I have ever really known and we are really busy just now, so I am hoping to carry on working at least until we get our heads around everything that has happened.  ""The boss has been great to me over the years and I want to pay them back for that by staying on and working – here’s hoping he will let me have time off for the holiday though!” John explained he played the National Lottery regularly, but got his days mixed up and was too late for the Wednesday draw – so while he was in the shop on a Thursday, he bought a EuroMillions ticket for Mega Friday instead. The rest is history... It comes as National Lottery revealed that over half of their winners believed they received a ""sign"" before they won. While over a fifth (22%) of millionaires believe their fortune was all down to a ""lucky charm"". This lottery-winning couple praised a stray black cat as their ""lucky charm,"" claiming it helped them scoop up a £1million win. Last year, Ian Black from Carlisle won big after he was nearly diverted from his usual routine on his way home from work due to road works. Something made him continue and, as he was buying his paper, a National Lottery Scratchcard caught his eye - a decision which led to a £2M win. Meanwhile, another couple hit the jackpot after a crazy dream prophecy - which didn't make sense until they got mind-blowing news about their £15.5million win.

I was left with no money for weeks because my bank thought I was dead…I couldn’t pay for my nan’s funeral – I’m furious,"A MUM has told how she was left without any money for weeks after her bank accidentally registered her DEAD. Natalie Holdsworth, 30, was shocked to learn Halifax closed her account in May last year thinking she was deceased - when it was actually her grandmother who had died. The mum-of-three had been taking care of her nan, Eileen McEvoy, and her gran’s pension had been going into Natalie’s account every four weeks. But when Ms McEvoy passed on May first, 2021, her bank somehow thought it was Natalie who had died. Natalie, from Bridlington, told The Sun: “It was about the 17th of May, that's when I had first realised that I had been registered dead. “I had gone to Tesco and when I tried to pay my card said it was suspended on the card machine. “I thought ‘oh well that’s strange’. I had money on it so I was confused. “I came out of Tescos and I rang the bank straight away and it asked me to enter my sort code account number and all of that. “All of a sudden I heard a ringtone. This lady answered the phone and she was like ‘Hi you're through to the bereavement line’. “I told her who I was and then she said ‘oh I’ve got it down that you passed away on May first’. “I said ‘pardon?’. I was so shocked. I said ‘well I’m clearly not dead because I’m on the phone to you’.” Natalie explained to bank staff that it was her granny who had died - and after three hours on the phone, they said they would get her account back up and running. But it took weeks for her new card to arrive and be set up. Natalie said: “Then the next problem was that I owed the funeral directors money for my nanny’s funeral. “I told them what had happened and I was crying and upset because I owed them all the money. “I asked them to help me but they said they’d never heard of anything like this happening before. “I had to get an emergency loan from the council and rely on my family and my partner’s family for money. It was absolutely ridiculous.” Once Natalie’s bank account was back up and running she went back to Halifax to try to seek compensation for the distress they caused her. But she was shocked when she learned how little they were offering her. She explained: “They offered me £11 to cover the three-hour phone call I had made previously.  “I thought they were joking. £11 for all the stress and hassle that they had caused me.  I said ‘well I’m clearly not dead because I’m on the phone to you’. “When I pushed then he said he could offer me £73. “I said no that's still not cutting it. I’m not happy with what they had done to me."" The Financial Ombudsman has reviewed the case twice and has paid £1,289 to settle the complaint. But Natalie believes the amount is not fair - as she is still experiencing problems as a result of their error. Bank and credit card providers are required to have a written complaints process that tells helps customers how to make a complaint. You should be able to find the information on their website but if you don't, ask them to send it to you. It's worth making your complaint as soon as possible, as it'll be easier to remember all the relevant details to strengthen your case. Then simply follow each stage of the process, and submit as much evidence as you can. Once you've sent in your complaint, the firm needs to give you a response within eight weeks. If you don't get a response within eight weeks or you're not happy with the one you do get, you can take your complaint to the free Financial Ombudsman Service. She said: ""To be honest with all the hassle they’ve put me through it's just not enough."" “Since then I’ve just had a massive issue. I can’t get credit, I can’t get anything on finance. “Even catching up with my bills is hard work after having to go that long without money.” A Halifax spokesperson: “We were very sorry to hear of Miss Holdsworth’s loss and understand the distress and inconvenience the issue with her account will have caused at such a difficult time.  ""When Miss Holdsworth contacted us, we immediately removed the block and issued a new card which arrived in less than a week, and agreed to cover any costs incurred.  ""We also made an additional payment in recognition of her experience.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/19985767/bank-accidentally-registered-mum-dead/

You’ve been using your electric blanket all wrong – six things you must avoid,"ELECTRIC blankets are a staple in older households - but they're becoming a growing trend among the young too. But households should be aware of the risks that come with using the handy gadget - especially if you aren't using it correctly. If you do use them wrong you could put yourself at risk of electrocution and your home at risk of fire. Electric blankets have become a must-buy for many as they are a cheaper way of keeping warm instead of relying on central heating. Heating yourself rather than your entire home is more cost effective for those worried about rising energy bills. Blankets cost just 3p per hour to run, on average and usually cost from around £30 all the way up to £100, depending on the model you choose. Many associate the gadgets with pensioners but this isn't the case anymore. Young people are now the most likely to use electric blankets as an alternative heat source, according to Electrical Safety First. In fact, young people are now three times more likely to use an electric blanket than the elderly, the electrical safety charity says. But there are a number of risks many first-time users may be unaware of. Lesley Rudd, chief executive of Electrical Safety First has said that it's imperative that people do ""all they can to stay electrically safe."" Here are the six things you need to avoid when using your electric blanket. Those with the handy heating gadget should always roll their blanket as opposed to folding it. This is because over time folding can weaken the wiring in the blanket. If you don't have the space to store the blanket it can be left on your bed all year round, according to Electrical Safety First. Lesley said: ""Lots of us are guilty of folding our blankets to put them away but over time you’ll stress and weaken or wear the wires that heat the blanket up leaving them frayed, exposed or vulnerable to becoming too hot. ""Roll your blanket instead, this way you’ll reduce the chance of damaging it or causing a fire."" Using your electric blanket with an extension lead is a major no-no. This is because it increases the risk of overloading the circuit and this could cause an electrical fire. Only plug your heated blanket into a mains plug socket. It's recommended that you do not sleep with an electric blanket on. If it is left turned on for a long amount of time, the blanket may overheat and cause severe burns. Electric blankets are designed only to pre-warm your bed. The blankets and pillows that you have on your bed, will help to capture the heat and keep you warm all night. That way, you won't end up getting easily cold throughout the night when you're asleep. If you're pregnant or trying to get pregnant, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that you should not use electric blankets. If you suffer from diabetes, the doctor might also advise you against it. This is because diabetes can cause a complication called neuropathy, or nerve damage. When this happens, you might not be able to feel how hot the electric blanket actually is and might burn yourself. It is common knowledge that water and electricity are a deadly mix. That's why it's imperative to keep your hot water bottle as far away from your electric blanket as possible. And if you spill a drink or any water on the gadget switch it off and unplug it from the mains immediately. Lesley said: ""If water comes into contact with any of the elements, you risk electric shock. ""At the first sign of discolouration or scorch marks, stop using your blanket immediately, it may be damaged and risk a fire."" Some electric throws are machine washable but it is vital to ensure that these devices are completely dry before they are switched back on.  Electrical Safety First recommends that shoppers stick to British High Street stores or go directly to their trusted online websites to ensure that the products they buy are safe. The advice comes just days after Which? warned that some devices being sold in the UK are made so poorly that they risk giving the user an electric shock. The consumer website tested 11 electric blankets, throws and shawls from retailers including AliExpress, Amazon, eBay and Wish. It found that nine out of the 11 items that it bought should not be sold legally in the UK because they were badly made or had problems with packaging, markings or instructions. Lesley said: ""Times are tough, so we know cheaper products will be hugely tempting but beware of bargains that seem too good to be true on online marketplaces. ""Dangerous electric blankets have been found for sale on these sites that aren’t safe for you to use. Registering your electric blanket with the manufacturer is always a good trick to ensure that you can be updated quickly if there are any product recalls. Households can check if their item has faced a recall on the Electrical Safety First website. The handy tool lets you search for specific products and brands to keep your mind at ease.

Eye-watering sum dog owners will spend celebrating Valentine’s Day with their pooch revealed,"DOG owners will spend £300million celebrating Valentine’s Day with their four-legged friends this year, a report claims. They will spend an average of £30 on gifts for their pets. Men typically spend £8 more than women on Valentine goodies for their dogs, a poll found. More men than women described their dog as their “baby”. Meanwhile, most of those polled would rather have a long walk with their dog than a mini-break with a partner. Moreover, a third of those who enjoy a regular date night make sure their dog is included in their plans. It comes as Love Island star Olivia Attwood, 31, partnered with dog food company Butcher’s to launch a range of Valentine’s Day cards. They cost £1 online with all proceeds going to Butcher’s Nourish Every Dog programme. Olivia said: “My dogs are the centre of my life, so it’s no surprise pet owners are going wild in the aisles to celebrate the love they have for their dogs during the season of love.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/21276747/dog-owners-spend-celebrating-valentines-day-pet/
We’re fuming after ‘cowboy’ builders left us in unlivable half-finished homes – they cost us thousands,"HOMEOWNERS have been left fuming after cowboy builders left them in ""unlivable"" homes.  Shocking pictures show ""unfinished jobs"" and ""months of frustration"" for people left in the lurch by a company who have since gone bust.  Customers who used Nova Building and Developments Ltd claim their lives have been put on hold for nearly one year. The Weymouth-based company statements reveal they owed 18 creditors a total of £296,095,000 - which included around £123,000 owed to HMRC. Piles of rubble and brick, unfinished floors, and leaking ceilings is just the beginning of what people claim they've had to live with. Former customer Jane Eagles said her house hasn't been in a livable state for months. Jane took to social media after the stress of an unfinished home forced her to pull the plug. She reached the end of her tether after ""months of shoddy work, false promises"" and ""sleepless nights"". Steve Taylor, who had made payments for a single-storey flat roof extension, said new contractors had to ""completely start again"" following Nova's original work. Nova said they were forced to fold due to ""repeated challenges"" and a ""hate campaign"" which saw them lose business. A spokesman for the company said: ""Like many businesses we started to struggle with rising costs over the past year but we were coping.  ""Deadlines weren't always able to be met because of these issues but this was communicated with our clients at all times. ""A lot of the work was subcontracted and we had people on site that we thought we could trust and we did trust them but, in some cases, things could have gone better.  ""We were paying workers for a full day of work and quite often they would be clocking off early: these are issues that we didn't always know about. ""We are confident that if we were allowed to finish the work in the cases highlighted then there would have been no issues. ""A lot of claims have been made on social media about the company - some have been completely outlandish - and that has contributed to us having to liquidate.  ""We have lost business as a result of a hate campaign and it left us with nothing. ""We have received an awful lot of support from clients, friends and family that know we would not rip anyone off and we would always complete a job to the best of our ability. ""We have been harassed, and in some cases threatened, which crosses the line."" Trading Standards confirmed they were aware of one outstanding complaint regarding the company and were ""looking into"" the circumstances. If the building company you're using goes bust before the job is finished, you do have rights. According to Consumer Rights Expert, if you paid a deposit between £100 and £30,000 on a credit card you can try using Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. This would give the credit provider equal liability in law for a breach of contract. You could also try and claim the deposit and any out of pocket expenses back from the finance company. You might also be covered if you have a finance agreement.  ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/21295737/cowboy-builders-left-unlivable-half-finished-homes/
Inside ‘UK’s tallest house’ built on top of a water tower with 67 steps to the top  – here’s how to stay there,"THIS former watertower is now the UK’s tallest house - and Brits can book in for a holiday in the sky. The House in the Clouds in Thorpeness, built in the 1920s, used to have the important job of supplying water across Suffolk. Now holidaymakers can book in for a relaxing stay with fantastic views. It boasts five bed rooms, three bathrooms, a dining room, and a drawing room and a stunning living area at the very top of the building. But to get to the beautiful room, decked out with a pool table and a wrap around mezzanine, guests must trod up a whopping 67 steps. It was built in 1923 to receive water pumped from Thorpeness Windmill and was designed to improve the look of the water tower by disguising its tank. But in 1977 the water tower was made redundant by a mains water supply to the village, and 10 years later it was converted into a home. The house was designed in children’s writer Mrs Malcolm Mason - who wanted it to mirror homes in fairy tales. Standing at 70ft tall it’s thought the home is one of the tallest in the UK. It comes after we told of the UK's smallest home. The wee house stands just 122 inches tall, is 72 inches wide, and only has specially made furniture - because that's all that will fit through its door. The Conwy, North Wales, home attracts more than 50,000 visitors a year. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/21277723/inside-uks-tallest-house-built/
"One bedroom home could be yours for just £9,000 – but there’s a grim catch","A ONE bedroom home has gone on the market for just £9,000 - but there's a grim catch. The flat in Birmingham was recently made available on property site Zoopla for the cut-price fee. And at first glance, house-hunters will be thinking they could snap up a bargain. But any potential owners may have to get their hands dirty to make the most out of the property. The cheap one-bad flat commands such a low fee because it is in need of a clear out and some serious modernisation.  While the exterior looks relatively promising and well-kept, the interior is a different story. With stained walls, peeling wallpaper, no carpets and debris littering the home, the new owners will need to get stuck in to make the house liveable. The house in general is faded and in desperate need of a modern overhaul. But if you’re willing to put in some elbow grease, it could be a great investment for just £9k. Photos from inside show there is plenty of space for a couple who want to make it their first home. The purpose built ground floor apartment stands in communal grounds. It has an open plan reception and kitchen, a bedroom and a shower room. The property also benefits from having a gas fired central heating and double glazing And it has excellent links to both transport and schools in the local area. The flat is available to be bid on at a live auction which will be live-streamed. Prospective buyers can also take a virtual tour if they wish to view the house remotely. Bond Wolfe Auctions are the letting agents facilitating the sale. It comes after a terraced property is on sale for just £15,000, although it comes with a catch. Eagle-eyed viewers may well be able to spot the strange feature. And a pokey flat is available on the market for £1,300 a month, but the bed might put some renters off.

I live in the middle of a roundabout – we don’t have to worry about neighbours… we love it and we’ll never move,"A MAN who has lived in the middle of a roundabout for more than 40 years says he loves his property on a public road and has vowed to never move out.  Clwyd Howatson, 64, feels most at home hearing hundreds of cars whizz past his pad on the Denbigh bypass in Denbighshire, Wales. His charming bungalow on the busy stretch of the A525 from Rhyl to Ruthin has been in his family for more than 60 years.  Despite the boundaries of his land being adorned with the typical flower beds and chevron signs, Clwyd adores his unorthodox home. The grandad chooses to look on the bright side of being plonked in the middle of a hectic highway and even brags that he doesn't have to bother with any neighbours.  He and his wife Anwen, 60, have become accustomed to the noise on the rowdy roundabout and instead boast of their picturesque views. Clwyd explained that his rustic bungalow is the perfect spot to observe the idyllic landscape of the Welsh countryside.  And he is keen to pass on his appreciation for the outdoors to his seven kids and 12 grandchildren after his upbringing on the rural roundabout. The 64-year-old now proudly watches the little ones enjoy playing with his two hens, just as he did as a child.  Clwyd said: ""The lovely views are spectacular and we are lucky to have them.  ""We probably take them a bit for granted, but they are great in all the seasons. ""I've lived on the roundabout for over 40 years so it's pretty much all I know.  ""We'd lived here for 20 years before that as well so it's been in the family for a very long time. ""Life on the roundabout does get busy at times - especially when the grandchildren stay over. ""But I was working on the A55 the other day and the traffic noise from that is much greater than anything we get.""  But most importantly, Clywd doesn't have to care about conversing with any other residents - and is in a convenient spot for travel. He continued: ""We don't have to worry about the neighbours as we don't have any on the roundabout.  ""Most of the family live close by, so it's a handy central point. I'd say it's like living by any road but it's not that bad.  ""We have double glazing so it's not something that bothers us and the road only gets really busy at peak times, which is only a few times a day."" But the grandad admitted there are some drawbacks to living in the middle of a roundabout.  Clywd said: ""Sometimes getting off the roundabout can be a bit of a challenge.  ""When people are on a roundabout they don't expect someone to come out of the roundabout itself so we do get a few double-takes."" As well as this, he explained delivery drivers are often driving in circles when trying to find his address.  The grandad added: ""We share the same postcode as the houses around us so it can take a while for drivers to realise the house is on the roundabout if they've not been before. ""Normally when we give instructions it's fine, but I do end up saying: 'No, no, we're not by the roundabout - we're on it and they always sound a bit dubious until they get here."" Clwyd's father David John and his mother Eurwen Howatson moved into the bungalow back in 1960.  Back then, there was no roundabout or Denbigh bypass, just a small holding that surrounded their home. That was until the late 1970s when plans were submitted for a roundabout following the completion of what at the time was the new Denbigh bypass. David John and Eirian were told they could not build another bungalow on their small holding and they refused to uproot their family, so they stayed put as the roundabout was built around them. The roundabout was completed in 1980 by which time David John had sadly passed away. But 42 years later, it remains in the Howatson family - and is set to for many more years to come.  In other property news, one couple came up with a very unusual way to heat their home and people stop to take pictures. Plus, take a look inside seven other unusual properties with prices from just £75,000 including a church and coach house.

UK’s ‘shortest house’ could be yours for £70k – but you better mind your head,"YOU could be the proud new owner of the ""UK's shortest house"" as it hits the market for just £70k.  The miniature abode would make the perfect cosy cottage - but you better mind your head as it's only two metres tall.  The pocket-sized pad in Newton Poppleford, Devon, is 265 years old and was originally built in 1758.  The thatched toll house has walls that measure the same size as an average door - but it fits more than you may imagine.  Crammed inside is a porch, a living room with open attic space, a kitchen, shower room and bedroom.  There is also a tiny paved outdoor area to take a breather when you're feeling confined.  The remarkable property was put on the market via the Clive Emson Land and Property Auctioneers website.  Home experts say it would be the perfect ""lock-up and leave"" hideaway or an opportunity for renovation.  The ""charming"" toll house is also located just a stone's throw away from the tourist hotspot, the Jurassic Coast.  The listing read: ""The property is likely to be of interest to a homeowner or those looking for a lock-up-and-leave bolt hole. ""It could also be of interest to investment purchasers."" Another ridiculously small home went on sale for £215,000 The unique Eastgate Lodge has 306sq ft of space hidden underground for any prospective buyers. Current owners boasted it ""only takes 30 minutes to clean"" as well as being in a prime location in North Yorkshire.

Judge begs widow to give up her obsessive 20-year fight over garden fence,"A WIDOW has been begged by a judge to give up her obsessive 20-year fight over a garden fence. Norma Yozin-Smith’s case has run up more than £100,000 in court bills and is said to have caused misery for herself and her neighbours, Anthony and Julie Alexander. Now, after another court ruling went against her, Judge Alan Johns has said: “All boundary disputes are regrettable but this one is more regrettable than most. “I implore her to give it up and to move on from it for her own good as well as for the good of the Alexanders.” Norma, 73, claimed the fence between her house and neighbours strayed into her garden in New Barnet, North London. She argued it ignored a boundary line drawn by a surveyor in 2007. Judge Johns ruled that the fence line was correct at Central London county court. But he said she was entitled to £500 as the fence encroached on her garden through disrepair. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21270372/judge-obsessive-widow-legal-fight-garden-fence-costly/
Pensioner locked in £100k 20-year fight with her neighbours over fence ‘that crossed into her property’,"A WIDOW has been locked in a fight with her neighbours for 20 YEARS after claiming their fence crossed into her property. The long-standing feud has racked up an eye-watering £100,000 in legal fees and two decades of bad blood which Judge Alan Johns has said ""brought misery to her as well as to her neighbours."" Norma Yozin-Smith, 73, claimed the fence between her house in New Barnet and neighbours Anthony and Julie Alexander strayed into her garden.  The widow alleged that the fence violated a boundary line tepidly agreed upon by both parties in 2002. In 2007, both sides enlisted a surveyor who spoke to the respective households and prepared a final letter - before marking out the boundary. Soon afterwards, the Alexanders put up the new fence along part of the new boundary line. The couple assumed a compromise had been fairly reached. However, Yozin-Smith sued the couple, citing a violation of the recommendation made by the surveyor.  She argued that the couple hadn't followed the prescriptions - resulting in her trees and plants ending up in her neighbour's garden. The couple have denied that accusation. Judge Alan Johns has since thrown out Mrs Yozin-Smith's case. Giving his ruling, the Judge said: “All domestic boundary disputes are regrettable, but this one is more regrettable than most. ""It continues despite having already been resolved by a boundary agreement as long as 15 years ago when both sides agreed to be bound by the determination of their shared boundary by a surveyor - who set out his views on the boundary in a report on 9 February 2007 revised by a letter on February 15."" He went on to rule that the marked out boundary line faithfully reflected the surveyor’s report, adding: “I reject entirely her case that the line marked out on the ground failed to reflect the report of 9th February. “It follows that the agreed boundary line is represented by the line marked on the surveyor’s digital plan."" However Judge Johns went on to find that part of the Alexanders’ fence was leaning into Mrs Yozin-Smith’s garden due to dilapidation.  He conceded: “I find that there is a nuisance by encroachment to the extent of half the width of some of the posts”. While refusing to order an injunction against the Alexanders  and ordering them to modify the fence, Judge Johns said Mrs Yozin-Smith should be entitled to a compensatory sum. He concluded: “I have in mind an award of £500.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/property/21265324/neighbours-100k-20-year-fight-over-fence/
Our village with miles of beaches is now a ‘ghost town’ – locals are being pushed out and can’t afford shoes for kids,"RESIDENTS have been left fuming after their village became a ""ghost town"" with locals struggling to survive. Withernsea in East Yorkshire is a popular seaside resort in the summer as families flock to the sandy beaches for the school holidays. But outside of the holidays, locals have branded their village a ""ghost town"", ravaged by a cost of living crisis that has left hundreds dependent on emergency food parcels. It's seen hundreds more households signed up to a community scheme to pick up supermarket food at knock-down prices. Charity bosses say the town is now so poor some kids have ""no shoes"" and warn how parents have turned to predatory loan sharks to survive. The heartbreaking conditions have seen even teachers and nurses turn up to the town's food bank desperate for food to feed their families. A toy bank has even been opened, just so kids living in poverty have a birthday present to open. Pensioner Ray Morley, 75, has lived in Withernsea for 45 years and spoke of how the ailing high street - with three vape shops and four charity shops nestled among discount stores - was suffering. Mr Morley said: ""People haven't got the money left to spend once they've paid the bills. ""When the caravaners and holidaymakers aren't here, it's just like a ghost town. ""Hopefully when spring arrives, they'll come back and inject a bit of life into the place."" At the Shores Community Pantry, two in three of the town's 6,500 residents have signed up to access cheap food. Manager Jayne Nendick, 54, said: ""To enable a community to thrive, first we need to ensure it survives. ""At the moment we are seeing people in dire straits. We need to help them stand back up again. ""We don't want to see the town collapse and roll into the gutter. We're desperately trying to help people with the limited resources that we have."" The pantry obtains discount food from supermarkets and sells on the goods for a fraction of the price, including 50p for a supermarket-sized bag of fruit or veg, and 50p for a 250g pack of turkey mince. The store buys stock from FareShare, which it then sells at discounted prices to people on benefits and low incomes. Marie Bone, 40, picked up an £8 M&S chicken meal for just £3, as well as pies for less than a quid. She said: ""They get deliveries of food twice a week and as soon as it goes in to the shop, it goes out again. ""It's probably the busiest shop on the high street because no-one's got any money to pay supermarket prices."" The Healthy Start scheme offers out prepaid food cards to women who are more than 10 weeks pregnant or parents who have children under four. You typically must also be on certain benefits, such as Income Support, Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance or Child Tax Credit. Some supermarkets which are part of the scheme include Tesco, Iceland and Aldi. Also, Sainsbury's is offering at extra £2 to customers who shop with a Healthy Start card. The Household Support Fund sees thousands of households can get £60 of free supermarket vouchers to spend on food and essentials. The help will be dished out under a new round of £421million funding given by the government to the Household Support Fund. To be eligible, you must be a care leaver or have a child who receives free school meals. What you can get depends on your personal situation and also who your local council is. Welfare assistance Most local councils run their own welfare assistance schemes for households on low incomes or who are dealing with a crisis. Grants can sometimes be worth up to £1,000. Marie continued: ""I've spent a tenner and got about £30 worth of food. That will last me for two weeks. ""It's a lifesaver. There's not much around here and it's so hard to get a job."" The town - home to the 19th-century Pier Towers - will see a campaign launched this year to stop people turning to loan sharks. The council fear hundreds could turn to illegal lenders to pay soaring bills. Mrs Nendick said her charity had handed out 286 food bank parcels in December, and expected record-breaking figures in January. She said: ""I've been here for 18 years and this is the worst I've ever seen it. During Covid I thought it was bad, but that's nothing compared to right now. ""The problems are just escalating on a daily basis and you wonder where it will all end up. ""It's not what I would call the usual suspects who are struggling - it's the working poor. ""We're seeing people who work in education, in health, where their income doesn't match their expenditure. ""They've cut back on absolutely everything and still there is a deficit. We are seeing desperation every day."" ""They've cut back on absolutely everything and still there is a deficit. We are seeing desperation every day."" Brent Denning, 65, and his wife Sue, 61, run giftware shop Inspired on Withernsea's high street. They told how they open seven days a week just so passers-by do not think their store is among the many to have shut down. Sue said: ""We open on Sundays just so people know that we're open. We don't take much money at all but we don't want them to think we've closed. ""Fortunately we can get by because people know us and we've been here for a few years. But a lot of other shops have been like revolving doors. They keep opening up and closing down."" Brent added: ""People in the community are really struggling to get by. ""All their money is going on their heating and there's nothing left to spend. It's the same everywhere - it's not just Withernsea. Everyone is in the same boat.""  At personalised gist store Precious Prints, Ellen Cleworth, 45, accused the council of turning its back on the high street. She revealed she has to clear dog fouling from outside her shop ""once a week"" and rarely sees street cleaners. Ellen said: ""They don't seem to care. It's a shame that we don't get the backing that we deserve."" ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/21261801/village-miles-beaches-ghost-town/

"I’m living for free in a 5-bedroom house in Surrey – it saves me £1,000 a month on rent, how you can do it too","WHEN Alex Walker was faced with monthly rent and bills of £1,000 before Christmas he knew he had to do something. The editor and part-time student, then living in Camberwell, London, was coming to the end of his 12-month rental contract and the rate was going up. But rather than forking out the extra cash, he decided to get online and find somewhere to housesit - staying in someone's property while they are away. Now, Alex is in a 5-bedroom home in Esher, Surrey, living totally rent-free. He doesn't have to spend a penny on household bills or council tax either. The family who own the home are waiting for a sale to go through and are currently in Australia. But they still need someone living in the property so they are covered by their home insurance. Alex snapped up the temporary home after looking on housesitmatch.com. It's a website which connects potential housesitters with people looking for someone to stay in their property. Alex just needs to keep the home clean and isn't obliged to cover any extra costs. If anything needs fixing by a tradesperson he just needs to let the family know. Any breakages are covered by home insurance. The 28-year-old has already saved himself a whopping £1,000 on rent and bills in just one month. Alex said moving into the property had been the ""ideal situation"", as he's currently paying for a postgraduate degree. ""I'm really lucky, the house is number one, the most comfortable house I've ever lived in, maybe ever seen. ""It's turned into a bit of a holiday."" Alex, who has done housesitting before while at university, doesn't know exactly how long he will be in the current home, as it depends on when the sale goes through. He said: ""It is quite lucky, I've done house sits before, but it's not been so long term - when they come along they are wonderful. ""If I'm here for three months, I'll save about £3,000 in total."" The process you'll have to go through to get a housesit property will vary depending on the website you use. Alex found the Esher home through housesitmatch.com, where housesitters can join and show their interest in properties. Owners then get to choose who stays in their home from a pool of interested people. Home insurance policies usually stipulate that a property can't be left unoccupied, which is often why they are looking for a sitter. At the end of the process, each party can leave a review. There's no exchange of money between the matched sitter and owner, but if you want to housesit you have to pay a £69 per year fee to feature your profile on the website. People wanting to put their property on the website also have to pay the same cost. Both housesitters and homeowners can pay £89 for a premium account too, which includes a bigger profile and homeowners can post up to three adverts at the same time. You also have to go through an in-depth ID check, involving taking a selfie and sharing your identity via online websites such as LinkedIn and Facebook. Plus, you have to take a photo of an ID document and upload it - this could be a passport or driving licence. Housesitmatch.com recommends you have an up to date DBS check too. Alex had to sign a legal contract before moving in. This was provided to the homeowners from the website and is checked over by lawyers. How long you can stay in a property will vary - housesitmatch.com's average sit is three weeks, but you can stay in some for a year. You can pick from homes across the world too, including the US and Spain. In some cases, you might have to look after a homeowners pets as well as their property. One current listing is for a one-week stay from March 16 at a home in Bedford, near London. But it will involve you looking after the owner's three dogs, making sure they are fed and walked daily. Another listing is for a home stay in Haverhill, Suffolk, between June 30 and July 16, involving looking after three dogs. Or, if you feel like pushing the boat out, you could stay at a home in Charleston, South Carolina, USA, for five days from mid April. Again, you'll have to take care of the owners' dog. You don't have to use housesitmatch.com like Alex though - there are other websites out there. One is housesittersuk.co.uk where you can find a housesit to stay from one week to two months or more. The website has a useful tool too where you can refine your search to include properties with wheelchair access and where you can bring any pets. Or you could try housesitters.co.uk which gives you access to a pool of house sitters who have all been vetted. But remember to check the fees involved and any rules for sitters, or obligations.  Alex recommends using Trustpilot to check out any housesitting websites. It's a platform where you can see how customers have reviewed other websites and businesses. You just have to enter the name of the housesitting website and it will bring up the reviews and offer a rating out of five, and comments from users, both positive and negative.

10 areas that’ll be least affected by falling house prices revealed – is yours on the list?,"THE 10 areas that will be least affected by falling house prices have been revealed. New analysis by Garrington Property Finders has found the areas which are the most ""recession proof"". According to the house hunting firm, the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea is set to be the least affected area. Followed by Westminster, Camden, Swansea and Oxford. The ranking was based on factors including the levels of mortgage debt, the proportion of first-time buyers and price changes in the past year. The firm said that each of the areas have fewer people with mortgages, so are unaffected by rising mortgage rates. Garrington’s analysis shows that 27.6% of households in Kensington and Chelsea own their home outright. Levels of outstanding mortgage debt in the wealthy boroughare exceptionally low, at just 7.3% of the total value of homes there. Each of top 10 are all pretty pricey areas where there are ""almost no"" first-time buyers, said Garrington.  Here is the full list of areas: Jonathan Hopper, of Garrington Property Finders, said: “Prime London postcodes, as well as several popular university cities, are the most likely to escape relatively unscathed. “Homeowners in these markets often have a good chunk of equity under their belts and are therefore more insulated from rising mortgage costs. “Unlike much of the country, the three London boroughs in our ‘most resilient’ top 10 also saw prices fall last year, making them less prone to further correction now and thus an attractive proposition to buyers looking for stability.” At the other end of the scale, first-time buyer favourites Milton Keynes and Crawley face the highest risk of falling prices. First-time buyers typically have few savings to fall back on and are more exposed to interest rate rises as mortgage payments swallow up a big chunk of their earnings. In Crawley they account for 7.1% of households, whereas they make up just 0.1% of Kensington and Chelsea residents. Almost a third (32.1%) of households in Crawley have a mortgage on their home and the total debt-to-equity ratio is three times higher than Kensington’s at 21.4%. It comes as the average UK house price fell by 0.6% in January, according to Nationwide's latest index. Annual house price growth slowed to 1.1%, from 2.8% in December, and the typical property value is now 3.2% lower than its August peak, according to Nationwide. The average UK house price in January 2023 was £258,297. The annual growth rate of 1.1% is the lowest since the early months of the pandemic, in June 2020, when house prices fell by 0.1% annually. House prices started to stall in September after the fall out from the mini-Budget. Mortgage rates have also been on the rise as the Bank of England has hiked rates consecutively pushing up borrowing costs for millions. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said: “There are some encouraging signs that mortgage rates are normalising, but it is too early to tell whether activity in the housing market has started to recover. “The fall in house purchase approvals in December reported by the Bank of England largely reflects the sharp decline in mortgage applications following the mini-budget. “It will be hard for the market to regain much momentum in the near term as economic headwinds are set to remain strong, with real earnings likely to fall further and the labour market widely projected to weaken as the economy shrinks.” Do you have a money problem that needs sorting?

"I made £18,000 after selling Homes Under the Hammer house just 4 months after buying it – how I did it","A MUM has revealed how she sold her home, which appeared on Homes Under The Hammer, for an £18,000 profit just four months after buying it. Nikki, from Crewe, Cheshire, appeared on the BBC show on January 31 and bought the three-bedroom property at auction for £215,000. The mum-of five initially planned to completely refurbish the whole place. Her ""little sidekick"", youngest son Archie, was apparently excited to start ""destroying walls"" with sledgehammers. She told the show's presenter Jacqui Joseph that she planned to redo the ""out-dated"" decor and add an extension to the back and a second one over the garage as a new bedroom. Nikki's budget for the remodel was £40,000 and it was projected to take six months. However, in the end, she decided to put it back on the market with very little work done. When the Homes Under The Hammer team returned four months later, the only apparent changes were new furniture and new turf in the garden, which had been cleared of clutter. Now, despite spending just £2,000 on renovating the semi-detached house, she sold it for £235,000. With the costs taken into account, Nikki raked in a profit of £18,000, partly due to a spike in house prices around that time. The property-mad mum is an old hand at this sort of project, having been buying and renovating homes since she built her own at 18. By the time her eldest child was 12, she had already lived in a dozen different houses. She said she now plans to teach Archie ""everything I know"" in the hope that he can ""take over and carry on what I love"". This particular project, though, had a happy ending as she donated the furniture that she cleared out to a formerly-homeless woman moving into her first flat. Like any auction there are risks and rewards with buying houses at auction. It's a quicker. more flexible way to buy a property than the usual method and you could bag a bargain. However, if an auction gets competitive you could end up paying over market value. The two main types of auction are unconditional and conditional auctions. The former is the more traditional format, where all the buyers come together in a room and make bids in front of one another over the course of a day, or even a few hours. In the latter, the auction runs for a set time period (like 30 days) and the highest bid at the end of that period wins, like on eBay. Conditional auctions are the most common for average buyers, rather than investors or developers, as it makes it easier to secure a mortgage before buying the property. It is always important to do your research before going to an auction. Make sure to view the house, get all the paperwork checked over by a solicitor and check that you're in a secure financial position first.

I’m a traveller mum – I’ve been forced to live in a mouldy council flat… I’d rather live in my caravan,"A TRAVELLER mum says she has been forced to live in a mouldy council flat – and would rather be in her caravan. Disabled Marie Rooney, 34, moved into a Nottingham City Homes (NCH) flat in the St Ann’s district of the city in October 2021 after she suffered a stroke. The Irish mum said though she would return to her old lifestyle “in a heartbeat” if her health would allow her to. Marie suffers from severe asthma and a heart condition, giving her breathing difficulties and is dependent on steroids. The mum-of-four also has swelling in her vocal chords which affects her speech. Marie is worried about the health of her kids due to the scale of the mould in her NCH property and has called for it to be urgently fixed. NCH said that officials carried out a survey when Marie first reported the problems towards the end of last year. A survey was carried out which highlighted mould and damp problems which needed sorting out. It added though that when staff arrived to carry out the repairs Marie refused the workers access because she wanted to be moved elsewhere. Marie said she couldn’t be present in the flat while the work was being carried out due to her health issues, adding that she needed alternative accommodation which NCH is working to provide. While she waits to be found alternative accommodation she is concerned for her children’s health and safety rather than her own as the ceilings in both rooms of her home are covered in black mould. Three of her kids are autistic and Marie said the “disgusting conditions” are impacting on their wellbeing. She also said that she believes she is ""treated less than other residents just because I am a traveller"". Marie said: ""They would not let anyone to live in these conditions. But because I am a traveller they would just leave me here. “Sometimes it is hard to speak because of my condition and I feel like they know that so they do not do anything. I have never lived in mould in my life."" Marie said she cannot clean the ceiling herself because of her health condition. ""It is disgusting. It's a nightmare,"" she added. ""I believe I am being discriminated. I do not want to moan about me anymore - it is about my children. It is really hard to breathe. ""Three of them have autism and one of them also has suspected ADHD. ""It is affecting them, children with autism need routine and this is not the place where I could offer them that. ""They have severe sleeping problems, they go to school tired. I am scared for my children's health."" A spokesperson for Nottingham City Homes said: “When Ms Rooney first reported the problems towards the end of last year, we took it seriously, acted promptly and carried out a full survey which revealed unacceptable mould and damp issues that needed addressing. “However, when we arrived to carry out the repair appointment, she refused to allow us in as she wanted to be moved to alternative accommodation while works were carried out. ""We’re seeking a temporary property suitable for her needs, although this is a challenge due to current demands for housing. “Part of the works we have planned is fitting dehumidifiers and associated equipment to reduce the amount of condensation generated in the flat, and once works are complete we will offer Ms Rooney support in managing the property to avoid this happening again.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/21242788/traveller-mum-mouldy-council-flat-health-kids/
Mortgage payment calculator: How much can you borrow?,"HOME buyers may find they're offered smaller mortgages this year as interest rates rise after hitting record lows during the pandemic.    Mortgage calculators can help you work out how much you can borrow, the monthly repayments and interest. It comes after the Pound fell sharply in value after September's mini-Budget, which included £45billion of tax cuts to be paid for by additional borrowing. The Bank of England has hiked interest rates several times in the past year with an aim to tackle high inflation. This week, it's expected to increase the rate for the 10th consecutive time up to 4 per cent. In December, the BoE predicted interest rates to peak at 4.5% in 2023 - lower than the previous 6% experts had warned of. There are plenty of calculators out there to help you figure out how much you can afford on your mortgage amid the chaos. Having an idea of how much you can borrow should help you decide what you need to save for a deposit and the type of property you can afford. It's also worth noting that lots of applications for credit can push down your credit score, including mortgage applications, so having a rough idea of how much you can borrow will help.  There are plenty of online calculators that let you do this without having to apply through a bank or building society. We've wrapped up the best mortgage calculators, what data you have to give and how to find the best home loan: Most mortgage calculators calculate how much you can expect to borrow from the bank.  However, these are just an estimate, the actual amount will depend on the lender and circumstances. Bear in mind that while house prices have dropped for several consecutive months, lenders are short and interest rates have increased. Rising rates and the cost of living crisis have meant fewer people are looking to buy a home or move home - badly impacting the housing market. MoneySuperMarket's calculator requires you to input how many people are purchasing the house, your income and any guaranteed bonuses. Based on your circumstances, it will tell you how much you should receive and the maximum you're likely to be offered. Which?'s calculator asks how many people are applying and how much their incomes are. The calculator provides an estimate of what you can afford and gives you a figure to show what your monthly repayments might be. Barclay's calculator asks for the number of applicants, income, regular expenditure, the reason you want a mortgage and the size of your deposit. It tells you how much you can get and gives you an overall rough property budget. MoneySavingExpert's calculator needs your income, guaranteed bonuses and overtime. It will provide you with the upper range of mortgages that you may be loaned.  It will also calculate how much you'd repay each month. The calculator also highlights that your credit score can affect how much you loaned and that lenders will ask about your expenditure and debts. Compare The Market's calculator asks for salaries and features an option to add guaranteed income.  You'll also need to provide how much deposit you have.  The calculator will predict what kind of loan you can expect and the amount you can afford to spend on a house. Trussle's calculator needs your and your partner's (if applicable) annual salary and deposit. Trussle also features an option to add in regular monthly outgoings, meaning it will provide you with a more accurate figure of what the bank will lend you. The calculator will also work out how much you can borrow, loan-to-value rate and the total house price you can afford. WE explain how to ensure you get the best deal on your mortgage or remortgage: Websites such as  MoneySuperMarket and Moneyfacts have mortgage sections so you can compare costs. All the banks and building societies will have their offers available on their sites too. If you're getting confused by all the deals on the market, it might be worth you speaking to a mortgage broker, which will help find the best mortgage for you. A broker will typically cost between £300 and £400 but could help you save thousands over the course of your mortgage. You'll also have to decide if you want a fixed-deal where the interest you're charged is the same for the length of the deal or a variable mortgage, where the amount you pay can change depending on the Bank of England Base Rate. Remember, that you'll have to pass the lender's strict eligibility criteria too, which will include affordability checks, and looking at your credit file. You may also need to provide documents such as utility bills, proof of benefits, your last three month's payslips, passports and bank statement. You can find out how much you need to repay by using thorough calculators by banks and building societies. They will typically ask for more details including outgoings, credit cards and loans.  They'll also ask about how many children you have, whether you're self-employed as well as details about bonuses and overtime. Nationwide Building Society will ask for your date of birth and sex to help with their calculations. Often these calculators provide a better idea of what you can afford but it's based on the providers' individual lending criteria which can vary.  Most calculators don't include credit checks and won't keep a record of your personal details so it's worth trying a couple to see if your specific circumstances change what you can get. Free ones include Halifax, Barclay's, Nationwide, Santander, and NatWest. After using an affordability calculator, you can calculate your monthly repayments with a mortgage repayment calculator. Usually, you'll need to know the size of the mortgage, the mortgage term (how many years it will last) and the interest rate. If you don't know the interest rates, the calculators typically put in a figure for you, but this is higher than the best deals on the market.  It helps you see what repayments will look like, but bear in mind you might be able to get a better rate by shopping around. If you don't know your mortgage term most of the calculators will put in 25 years which is the usual mortgage rate. There are lots of these calculators out there, and they tend to be quite similar. We recommend: Providers also usually offer repayment calculators based on their specific lending criteria, this can be very useful when you've narrowed your selection down to a couple of lenders. GETTING on the property ladder can feel like a daunting task but there are schemes out there to help first-time buyers have their own home. Lifetime Isa - This is Government scheme gives anyone aged 18 to 39 the chance to save tax-free and get a bonus of up to £32,000 towards their first home. You can save up to £4,000 a year and the Government will add 25% on top. Shared ownership - Co-owning with a housing association means you can buy a part of the property and pay rent on the remaining amount. You can buy anything from 25% to 75% of the property but you're restricted to specific ones. Mortgage guarantee scheme - The scheme opened to new 95% mortgages from April 19 2021. Applicants can buy their first home with a 5% deposit, it's eligible for homes up to £600,000. Affordability and repayment calculators aren't the only calculators that can help you when buying a home. In fact, online tools can help you calculate stamp duty, work out how much you can save by overpaying and compare different mortgage offers. Here are some of the most useful ones we could find. MoneySavingExpert calculators MoneySuperMarket calculators Which? calculators Trussle calculators There has recently been a huge shake up with mortgages, what could this mean for you.  A mortgage expert told us what you need to do now or you may face paying an extra £2,000 a year.

My dream home became a nightmare after council let greedy neighbour build new mansion just 40cm from mine,"A FUMING couple claim they've had to stop constructing their dream home after the council let their neighbour build a mansion just 40cm away. Kathy Morin and Devon Matsalla are assembling a house in Queensland, Australia, but say builders can no longer put up scaffolding to complete it. The pair say the entire project has ground to a halt - leaving them ""heartbroken"" as they pumped all their money into the build. Ms Morin told A Current Affair: ""If it was a couple of centimetres we wouldn’t be having this conversation but it’s preventing us from building our house, like that’s big, it’s not aesthetics. ""We’ve put in all our money we’ve put in all the time, we’ve been waiting a long time."" Mr Matsalla says they have filed a complaint with Gold Coast City Council as they fail to understand why permission was granted for another home to be built within touching distance. He said: ""Somehow it got approved through the chain.  ""I don’t know how it got approved, our builder has no idea, how it got approved."" But Greg Yong, CEO of Dreamworld which owns the other build, claims his house has been approved. He told the programme: ""We wouldn’t have been able to build it if it wasn’t certified."" Mr Yong held a meeting with the couple to talk out concerns.  After the discussion, it is understood Dreamworld filed a document claiming the extension “will not undermine the amenity of the adjoining property”. Mr Matsella said: ""If they maybe wanted a bigger home then they need a bigger lot."" A spokesman for Gold Coast City Council told news.com.au that the authority ""is investigating this complaint"". The council declined to comment further. Meanwhile, a mum who watched her neighbours build a home close to her own was left furious when the council wouldn't do anything about it. Niki Caira was horrified when she realised how close luxury homes were going to be to her house in Thorton, Fife, and immediately contacted her local authority to complain - but got nowhere. Niki and husband Mario objected to the planning application for the two £350,000 properties in 2020, however, they were given the go-ahead by Fife Council in June 2021. When building work started next door to her Scotland home in May, the mum-of-seven said she felt like her family's privacy had been invaded.

I live in tiny wooden shed I built myself in my mate’s back garden – I’ve stopped paying rent & save £600 a MONTH,"A MAN who lives in a tiny wooden shed in his mate's back garden insists he's saving at least £600 a month. Chris Marsh quit renting conventional houses five years ago and has lived in miniature eco homes ever since. Last year he decided to take things one step further and build one of his own, The Mirror reports.  He now spends his days in the 140 sq ft property in the grounds of his pal's property in Riding Mill, Northumberland. While Chris pays a fee to use the small plot of land, he is no longer a tenant paying a landlord rent in a traditional sense, and he is completely mortgage-free.  His monthly expenses come to just £230 - hundreds of pounds less than when he rented a two-bedroom house in Hexham.  About £80 of that goes on electricity and £150 pays for the plot - but water is free as his pals that own the land are on a standard rate.  While at his old place, where rent alone cost £800 a month, he spent £80 on electricity, £70 on gas, £25 on water and £160 on council tax.  Chris reckons that if he were still there today, this would have doubled as the cost of living has gone up.  The 40-year-old, who now keeps his underfloor heating on all day, said: ""I'd always had a vision of building something and living in it and living in a garden rather than a traditional house. That's where the tiny house concept came into play.  ""It just seemed to work for my needs and it's a very comfortable way of living. It's a minimalist lifestyle, absolutely. ""When you rent, it's just disposable money that you never get back really.  ""Building something of my own was a bit of a win-win. ""If you take your rent, council tax, utility bills, I'm saving at least £600 a month living this way."" Chris's tiny timber home, which cost £50,000 upfront, sits about 60ft from the land owner's house.  It has a mezzanine bedroom, a spare bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and living space.  At 140 sq ft, it is significantly smaller than the average 656 sq ft British home and much easier to heat.   Chris, who runs Tiny Eco Homes UK, said: ""My electricity has gone up quite a bit, like everyone's, but in a tiny house, you're essentially heating one room, and a small one at that.  ""The building is very efficient."" ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/21235698/tiny-wooden-house-back-garden/
Inside Britain’s richest gypsy Alfie Best’s £6m mansion with a car showroom and sweeping staircase,"BRITAIN'S richest gypsy Alfie Best has a net worth of £740MILLION - and he has the mansion to show for it. The Sun visited the businessman's £6m bolthole - where his well-heeled neighbours include an Arab sheikh and Queen rock star Brian May. Nestled on a quiet country lane, visitors enter through huge wooden gates which lead to a grand driveway. Lining the front of the house are the millionaire's enviable collection of supercars - which include a Ferrari F8 Spider, Rolls-Royce and £2.7m Bugatti Chiron. Alfie often stores the motors in his personal car showroom built at the back of the garden.  Through the front door, guests are met with an entry hall framed by a sweeping staircase leading to the upper level. Decked out with silver wall decals, the hallway leads through to the home's dining room - with a silver lightbox table blasting swirling shadows on the ceiling. The dining room leads to a perfectly coordinated living space - with silver feather wallpaper, matching sofas and reflective coffee table. On the other side of the hall is the family kitchen. The silver theme continues in there - with a shining stag taking pride of place in the centre of the countertop. And the whole property is spotless, a fact which Alfie says in unsurprising. He told The Sun: ""You'll often find with gypsies' houses - they're spotlessly clean. ""And it's on purpose. It's because of the stereotype 'all gypsies are dirty'."" After a tour of the kitchen, Alfie showed us through his surprisingly classic study looking out over the front garden. The desk, chairs and dresser are all matching shades of dark mahogany brown. Alfie's at-home office has something of a nautical theme - with a marine engine gauge, old-school diving helmet and treasure chest dotted throughout. It is perhaps a nod to one of Alfie's biggest purchases - a £9million superyacht. The 90-foot vessel boasts several James Bond-style gadgets - including a watersports speedboat tender and a jetski. Alfie is on track to be crowned the world's first gypsy billionaire as early as next year. His jaw-dropping wealth comes from his residential park homes empire Wyldecrest Parks, which made £32MILLION last year alone. Sun reporter Jemma was offered a peek into a normal day in Alfie Best's high-flying life. Multimillionaire Alfie starts at 6am - with a simple cup of coffee in the kitchen before work kicks off bang on 7am. And his hustle doesn't stop, with Alfie working late into the night. Most baffling of all, he doesn't stop for breakfast, lunch nor dinner - only breaking his fast with a late-night meal before bed. He travels around the country on his personalised helicopter - designed by James Bond’s favourite car company, Aston Martin. Just 15 of the seven-seater aircraft have been made - and Alfie was given Number 007. In true Alfie form, he even crowned it with the registration G-YPSE which is emblazoned on the fuselage. Alfie didn't start off with millions. He was brought up on the living in a caravan on a lay-by with an outdoor camp fire as a stove. But his childhood was happy, he shares. Alfie said: ""There was nothing wrong with how I was living - if I'm honest with you. ""I hear all these sob stories about how people were living hard lives. ""But they never fail to tell you that they knew know different. ""I didn't see anything wrong with the way I was brought up. ""Our kitchen was a cooking pan and a pot outside on an open fire. That was our cooking stove. ""I thought there was nothing wrong with it. People pay to go camping. It's what you're used to. ""We lived in a small caravan, me, my dad and my mum. Three of us. By small I'm talking ten foot long. ""We always had food in the cupboard - but we'd go out with our lurcher dog and what we killed, we'd eat. ""I'm talking about pheasants, rabbits, hares. I'm going to be honest with you - it seems a lifetime away that didn't happen. ""This is becoming the real and that's becoming the surreal. You've got to be careful with that.""

Bidding on the property opens on February 13, BirminghamLive reported. Anyone interested should pre-register on the BP Auctions website.  The advert for the property reads: ""This three bedroomed mid-terraced property is situated in this popular residential area of Birmingham, also close to shops and local amenities, within easy reach of the M6.

We’re taking our millionaire neighbours to court after they boxed us in with 6ft fence – we can’t get to our front door,"A FUMING couple have said they are taking their millionaire neighbours to court after being boxed in with a 6ft fence. Gary and Kerry Hambling thought they had found a perfect country home when they bought Garden Cottage, near Suffolk, in 2015. The four bedroom house boasts massive gardens, its own stable block and a two-acre field just yards away, across a drive owned by neighbours Garry and Jenny Wakerly. But they had a row with the Wakerlys in 2016 - whose luxurious £1m house lies on the same former farm as their property. It led to their neighbours erecting a fence and blocking off steps the Hamblings had built from their front door to the track. The fence travels along the edge of their drive and down one side of their neighbours front garden and has effectively boxed them in. Gary and Kerry claim this not only prevented them leaving their property in that direction, but decimated the value of their home. The Hamblings say the fence has wiped £100,000 off the value of their £600,000 house and has blocked access from their stables to the field. They added that the fence has cut off the views across the field previously enjoyed from their living room and made the ground floor of their house dark. Gary and Kerry are now asking a High Court judge to force their neighbours to reopen their ""front door"" access, labelling their actions ""deliberately and unpleasantly antagonistic"". While the Wakerlys say the Hamblings have been using the door to unlawfully ""trespass"" on their driveway whilst going between their cottage and the field, and that they put up the fence to stop them. Judge Sir Anthony Mann heard that the Wakerlys were upset and ""friction"" grew about plans the Hamblings had to make changes to their rural property, and in particular when they turned part of their field into a ""car park"" for ""vans and trucks"". They responded by telling Mr Hambling, 48, and Mrs Hambling, 44, that they were no longer permitted to cross over the driveway - which lies between the Hamblings' front door and their field - to access the field from their house. The court heard that the Hamblings had inherited a right of way to access their field up their neighbours' track from the main road when they bought the property. They were forbidden from getting to the cottage the same way under the right of way, but were allowed to cross the track by their neighbours whilst relations were still friendly. But in June 2017 the Hamblings were accused by their neighbours of ""trespassing"" on the drive, leading the Wakerlys to hire contractors to put up a 1.8m high close-boarded wooden fence, with concrete posts and gravel boards. The legal row now centres on the wording of the right of way, granted stating that the Wakerlys' driveway could be used ""for access to the field not to Garden Cottage”. And in 2021 Judge Karen Walden-Smith ruled in favour of the Wakerlys and allowing the fence blocking off Garden Cottage from the track and the field to remain. Giving her judgment, she described the row as a ""highly unfortunate case where owners of two country properties have not been able to find a way in which they can co-exist without friction. ""The complaint is that the fence blocks off the opening to the stables, effectively stops them from having access to and from - what they consider to be - the front door to Garden Cottage and interrupts their views and the natural light into the property. ""The behaviour of Mr and Mrs Wakerly has been described by counsel to Mr and Mrs Hambling as being '… monstrous conduct. It was deliberately and unpleasantly antagonistic. It must have been intended to intimidate'."" Finding for the Wakerlys, she said they were entitled to put up the fence because the right of way up the track was only for the use of the field, while Garden Cottage had its own access on the other side of the property. The effect of the fence has been to make the front door to the cottage redundant Challenging that finding in the High Court, Dermot Woolgar, for Mr and Mrs Hambling, said the judge in the county court had misinterpreted the wording of the right of way. He argued that the Hamblings had the right to use the front door of their cottage from the track if they had travelled up it from the road to their field first. Mr Woolgar said: ""The effect of the fence has been to make the front door to the cottage redundant, and to make it impossible to go from the stables through the gate, across the track, and into the field. ""The issue is whether the transfer permits that right of way to be exercised only to and from the highway...or whether it also permits that right of way to be exercised to and from Garden Cottage. ""Even if it does not, Mr and Mrs Hambling contend that the right of way enables them to make use of it to go to and from Garden Cottage for purposes which are ancillary to their use of the field. ""The right of way was not happily drafted. Given its textual weaknesses, and having regard to the geographical and practical realities, its meaning is not as straightforward as the judge found. ""Perhaps above all else, it is a stretch too far to suppose that the objective intention of the parties to the transfer was to render the front door to the cottage redundant forever after. ""No one would suppose that the seller would have wanted to prevent the buyers and their successors in title, having driven a vehicle along the track and into the field, from leaving the vehicle and walking across and/or along the track to the front door of the cottage, or indeed any other part of Garden Cottage, and returning back along the same route to get into the vehicle and to drive it out onto the highway again. ""All of these activities are obviously reasonable. If they were not to be permitted, the transfer needed to say so in clear words. It did not."" But Charles Irvine, for the Wakerlys, asked the judge to throw out their neighbours' case and let the fence stand as it is. ""The transfer wording is clear that the track should only be used 'for access to the field not to Garden Cottage', i.e. for access to and from the field and not to and from the cottage,"" he said. ""Contrary to Mr and Mrs Hamblings' case, its meaning is as straightforward as the judge found. There is an express prohibition to, at any point, be on the track to access to or egress from the cottage. ""A car park is situated on the field, leaving little room to ride horses and the appellants have never used the field for horses."" The judge reserved his ruling on the case at the end of a day long hearing and will give his decision at a later date.

Seven ways to get cheap rent – and you could get a discount of up to 20%,"RENTERS are always looking for cheap rates as the cost of living soars.  Rents outside London have increased by 11% annually - costing an average £1,162 per calendar month between July and September last year. As property prices increase, more people want to wait until the market cools - and look to renting instead. So how can you find to the cheapest rent possible? We explore some options for you below.  Homesharing is when someone invites another person into their property to help out with chores and house keeping in exchange for cheaper rent.  For example, it's very popular with students who are looking for low rent, and pensioners who need help looking after their home.  There are organisations you can either advertise or search through, like Homeshare UK. You might need to lend support with the following in order to get involved: We spotted one property in north London costing £199 per month, including bills, and that's about £500 cheaper than the average London rent price. That amounts to roughly 20% less. But do keep in mind you might need to pay a little more for council tax on top. The Rent to Buy scheme is where tenants can pay up to 20% below market rent in order to save for a deposit.  The scheme is only available in England and is there to support those looking to get on the property ladder. To be eligible, you must: However, you can only apply for properties in the scheme - which excludes anywhere in London.  You can view these properties on different letting agent websites or simply call them up for more information.  The initial tenancy agreement will last for two years, but it may be possible to extend it.  You'll be able to buy your home as soon as you have enough to secure a mortgage.  London Living Rent is London's own version of Rent to Buy - but you'll need to live or work in London, reside in private rented accommodation and have a maximum income of £60,000 to apply.  You also can't own any other residential home. You won't be eligible either if you can afford to buy a property elsewhere using shared ownership.  These tenancies usually last three years, but again could be extended. A property guardianship is when firms let out properties for discounted rent - usually schools, offices, care homes or other non-traditional homes.  The rent will be below property market value - the exact price depends on the building - and the firm will act as your landlord.  Basically, they'll make sure the building is not falling into disrepair and fits your standards.  You can search online for property guardians using sites like Global Guardians, and Blue Door Property Guardians.  However, just make sure you know your rights as a renter - property guardians have been known to ramp up costs in the past.  For example, a rent repayment order (RRO) can force a landlord to return money for breaking rules. A tenant or the council can apply for this through a tribunal, and a council might offer help doing this as they run the licencing scheme. Housing charity Shelter says there may be fees involved but these can be claimed back if successful. A property without a licence is not the only thing that can break the rules. You can read more about that here. There are some websites like House Sitters UK where you can search for a property to live in for free over a specific period of time while the owner is away.  It could help you stay on your feet - perhaps if you're a student needing to stay in your uni town over summer.  However, if you do apply via these sites, you'll need to pay a membership fee.  House Sitters UK, for example, requires a £29 monthly fee.  You'll also need to create a profile page so that homeowners can browse through your information, and provide valid identification.  According to our research, you could also earn roughly £20 a day from housesitting, but that depends on if you need to look after a pet in the property.  Other sites you can look on include Trusted Housesitters, MindMyHouse and Nomador. You might be able to get extra cash towards rent and essentials through the Household Support Fund. It is a £421million government programme - and councils get a slice of the funding to dish out to hard-up families in their catchment area. Some councils are offering free cash under the scheme - which you could use to put towards your housing costs. For example, East Riding Council is offering a maximum £400 - but the deadline to apply for that is tomorrow.  The scheme ends on March 31 - so don't waste any time checking in with your local council.  You can find that using the government locator tool. If you're on Universal Credit, you can apply for a Discretionary Housing Payment to help with your rent. The cash can also be used to cover housing costs like putting down a deposit, and advances you'll need for moving house. There's no set amount you'll be given - help will be given out on a case-by-case basis. But recent research showed some councils were offering up to £4,500 to families. And in total, local authorities dished out a whopping £171million in Discretionary Housing Payments for the financial year ending March 2021 - up 30% the prior year at £132million. If you're worried you won't be able to cover your housing costs, you should talk to your landlord. By being upfront at the start, you could be more likely to renegotiate a better rate while you get yourself back up and running. You could also ask for an affordable repayment plan to pay back what you owe. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/21211851/seven-ways-to-get-cheap-rent/
Will house prices drop in 2023?,"THE average cost of a home across the UK stands at £281,272 - but are prices set to fall further? Average UK house prices soared by 9.5% in the year to September, according to the ONS. Property prices had surged due to pent-up demand following coronavirus, a lack of homes on the market driving demand up and the end of the stamp duty holiday. But they saw the biggest monthly fall since June 2020 in November, according to Nationwide. At the start of December, Rightmove reported that the average asking price dropped to £359,137 - down by £7,862 from the previous month too. Rightmove's latest data showed that house prices rose by 0.9% - to £362,438.  This is the highest at this time of year since January 2020. However, average asking prices are still £8,720 lower than their peak in October. The house price slowdown late last year followed mortgage rates hitting a 14-year high in September, though they have now fallen back slightly. This was caused by political and economic turmoil following former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-Budget. An increase in mortgage rates has meant people thinking about buying homes are holding off, which in turn sees house prices drop. Tim Bannister, director of property science at Rightmove, said house prices could go up towards the end of the year despite having fallen in recent months. He said: ""We expect that the full effect of affordability constraints and last year’s mortgage rate rises will hold back some segments of the market in the first half of the year. ""But our leading market indicators may start to identify some green shoots of growth that will go on to strengthen in the second half of 2023."" However, Nick Morrey from Coreco Mortgages, said house prices could drop. ""Given prices have risen 20% or more since the first coronavirus lockdown, a correction was always on the cards. ""Current predictions are for a reduction in prices of around 10% but that would only put prices back to where they were in around January last year. ""Plus, despite the cost of living crisis we are seeing plenty of enquiries for purchases and properties for sale are still in short supply in many areas.""

I’m being kicked out of my home with my disabled son with just weeks’ notice – we’ve got nowhere to go,"A MUM and her disabled son are among a row of neighbours being kicked out within weeks.  The woman, 59, was in tears when she read a letter saying her, her husband and son, 30, who has Down's Syndrome, need to move. They have lived in their home in Thealby, North Lincolnshire, for three years and are struggling to find anywhere else due to high rent prices, Grimsby Live reports.  Earlier this month tenants in their row of terraced houses were handed letters telling them they have until April to move out because the landlord decided to sell them all.  The mum told Scunthorpe Live: ""We'd always been told it was ours for life as long as we looked after it.  ""The gentleman just handed the letter over and said, 'I have to do this, I'm sorry', and passed me it and went. He didn't explain anything. I just opened the letter and just cried. I felt numb."" ""I'm nearly 60, my husband is in his 50s and he has heart problems. He works shifts and I'm a full time carer for my son, so we only have one income coming in.  ""We don't have that sort of money and we're not in a position to buy. We have to eat, drink and pay bills so how are we meant to get the money together?,"" she said. ""My son has Down's Syndrome, he has a heart condition and he also suffers with anxiety and panic attacks.  ""We need to live in this area because my mum, who's ill in hospital, is from Burton, and if she does get back home, I'm her carer as well. I can't be a million miles away from her. ""It's come at the worst possible time for me, I've got enough going on.  ""I know they've given us two months' notice, but what are we going to find in two months? Rent prices are extortionate. It's just going to be so, so hard to find anywhere."" She said she would have accepted a rent increase but blasted how there had been ""no negotiation with any of the tenants at all"" and that they had no indication this would happen.  She added: ""Even if they offered us other rental properties, that would be fine, but they're not even coming to us and saying they can help. We had no information on it whatsoever, so I don't know what his thoughts are or why he's doing it. ""I wish I knew. I could understand a bit more if I knew a reason, but there's been no reason given.

""It doesn't just happen overnight, they could've given us some insight.  ""We've been told it's a business decision, it's nothing personal, but it is personal. No-one can afford houses at the minute because of the cost of living crisis."" The letter, from DDM Agriculture on behalf of the landlord, reads: ""As you are no doubt aware, Robert Sheffield is now the owner of the property which you occupy and, as such, some of the Estate priorities have changed.  ""A thorough review of all assets has recently been undertaken and various options considered. It has been concluded that not without the deepest of consideration, the Landlord has decided to sell off the property that you occupy.

We live in the UK’s ‘BEST’ village – everyone is super-friendly and houses are cheap… we wouldn’t live anywhere else,"RESIDENTS of a picturesque village say it's the 'best' in the UK - with friendly neighbours, stunning views and cheap houses. Alvechurch village, located on the border with Birmingham and Worcestershire, is a popular getaway for people seeking a breath of country air but who still need to commute to work. Dina, who has been a resident in the village for 35 years, told BirminghamLive she ""wouldn't live anywhere else"".  She added: ""Apart from a lack of bus services it's a wonderful place to live - everyone is friendly, there are good shops and it's a wonderful community."" Properties in Alvechurch range from pre-war former council buildings to larger impressive homes. The older houses and historic cottages, some dating back at least 200 years, are found dotted around the village centre. Alvechurch's claim to fame is that Godfrey Baseley, the man who created Radio 4 soap The Archers, was born there.  Godfrey, the son of a local butcher, Walter Ernest Baseley, invented The Archers back in 1950. BirminghamLive reported: ""It has it all: shops, a train station, two schools, plenty of housing, good transport links, and several pubs."" Alvechurch village is known for its community spirit coupled with an array of places to eat and drink and clubs and societies to join.

Just a short drive away is village Barnt Green, a well-known village with a thriving High Street and links with mega-rich Premier League footballers and other celebrities.  But residents reported you get more for your money in Alvechurch - houses are cheaper and there are far more of them. This is not the only UK village hailed for its scenery and atmosphere.

We’ve been ordered to stop using our luxury barn by council after neighbours complained we’re too noisy – we’re furious,"A COUPLE have been ordered to stop using their luxury barn after neighbours complained they were too noisy. Victoria and Richard Kerrison have been told by their local council to shut down their holiday lets after 10 years. It comes after the two cottages in Norfolk, which can accommodate 20 people, were at the heart of noise complaints.  According to North Norfolk District Council, the countryside rentals were operating without the required planning permission. Courtyard Barn and Pear Tree are up for £800 per night - which the couple were given permission for. However, the site also has a bed and breakfast called The Orangery. Officials claim The Orangery should only be used as an extension to Pear Tree and not a holiday let on its own. Victoria and Richard have also been ordered to move out of their home on the site and remove its kitchen and bathroom. The local authority state the barns should only ever have been used as an office - but the couple say this was never the plan.  The Eastern Daily Press reported a statement submitted on the couple's behalf said: “The whole building has never been solely used as an office as alleged. “It makes no sense to suggest, as the council has done, that the whole building was used as an office to service the administrative requirements of a business letting three small cottages whose admin needs are more than adequately met by a laptop, some shelves and a filing cabinet.” A council spokesperson said the area shouldn't be home to these kind of developments because the countryside needs to be considered.  They said: ""The appeal site is deemed to be considered as the countryside where development is restricted to particular types of development to support the rural economy, meet affordable housing needs and provide renewable energy.”  Close friend, neighbour and film producer Lady Anwen Hurt is expected to support the couple's appeal. The wife of late actor Sir John Hurt claims she has had no issue with noise and will submit a statement. It is understood the Planning Inspectorate will make a decision later this year.

"More than a fifth of Brit homes suffer from damp – with homeowners unsure over how to fix it, study finds","MORE than a fifth of homes are suffering from damp – with owners unsure how to control the problem or what causes it. A study of 2,000 adults found 24 per cent have found mould in their property and 21 per cent are currently living with damp. While 20 per cent regular endure 'excessive' condensation. A further 42 per cent have reduced the amount they heat their home this winter due to the rising cost of energy - exacerbating the issue. Among the most common surfaces to be affected are windows (65 per cent), walls (61 per cent), and ceilings (43 per cent). Despite it being such a big problem, 24 per cent are not confident they truly know why the likes of condensation, damp or mould occur. And a third struggle when it comes to reducing or removing such problems. As a result, those polled have ventilated areas when drying clothes indoors (34 per cent), kept lids on pans when cooking (29 per cent), and opened windows at night (23 per cent). Others have invested in anti-mould spray (36 per cent), dehumidifiers (36 per cent), and portable heaters (16 per cent). With 71 per cent having spent money in an effort to get rid of damp, condensation, or mould in the past 18 months – an average of £92. This is almost a quarter (23 per cent) of the £400 energy support households received from the Government.   A spokesperson for Utilita Energy, which commissioned the study, said: “This latest research confirms the size of the problem. “Affording to stay warm is hard enough as it is, without all the additional problems that come with having a damp home.” “Our nationwide rollout of free Bill Buster sessions has enabled us to hear first-hand from households who are struggling with various issues related to the cost of energy, condensation and damp were a common theme."" The study also found renters seem to suffer more, with 34 per cent of them living with mould - compared to 22 per cent of homeowners. While 27 per cent of renters are suffering with damp in contrast to19 per cent of owners are. More than a third of tenants (35 per cent) reached out to their landlord for help or advice, only for 44 per cent to not hear back. This left them feeling frustrated (69 per cent) and helpless (43 per cent). It also emerged three quarters do not know their legal rights as a renter when it comes to damp. A fifth (21 per cent) of everyone polled have struggled with condensation in the past 12 months more than ever before. And 44 per cent believe if increasing costs continue everyone will experience a similar issue at some point. More than half (61 per cent) don’t think there has been enough help from the likes of the Government or councils to assist in the rising cost of energy this winter. As a result of condensation specifically, 25 per cent have been forced to throw away soft furnishings such as cushions or blinds. While 23 per cent have had to replace clothes and 12 per cent have even relocated for good. Common ways to see to the issue were wiping down surfaces to remove it (60 per cent) and placing a heater near the affected area (22 per cent). While 19 per cent have even called in an expert to help. More than three quarters (79 per cent) polled via OnePoll aren't aware of grants are available so they can improve their property to avoid damp, condensation and mould. Utilita Energy’s spokesperson added: “Being a specialist Smart PAYG energy provider, around 75 per cent of our customer base are tenants, hence this awareness campaign. “We hope landlords will take notice and be more forthcoming with support to avoid long-term damage.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/21181566/brit-homes-suffer-from-damp-homeowners/
From mortgage rates to savings – Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey answers your queries as interest rates reach 4%,"THE Bank of England today raised interest rates for the tenth time in a row to 4 per cent.  The move will heap extra borrowing costs on Brits at a time when they’re facing soaring food and energy increases.  So why is Bank Governor Andrew Bailey making life harder for all of us?  Sun Business asks the questions readers want to know: Q) Do you think the rate of price increases has peaked? A) I hope so. There are definitely signs that we’ve turned a corner but as long as Russia continues this barbaric war, there’s always the possibility that energy prices could go up again. Q) Why are you still increasing interest rates when inflation is already easing off? A) We’ve all seen how difficult high inflation has been for millions of people. It looks like it’s beginning to turn the corner. But it’s early days, and we have to make absolutely sure that ­inflation falls and stays low and that’s why we’ve raised rates again. Q) Will this cause mortgage rates to rise again? A) Variable or tracker rates will rise. But for those taking out new fixed rate mortgages, those rates have fallen from the highs we’ve seen recently and I don’t expect our decision today to have much impact. Q) Will this be the last rate rise? A) It’s just too soon to say. It’s our job to get inflation back down to the 2 per cent target and for it to stay there.  We’ll make whatever decisions are needed to ensure that happens. Q) Do you think you’re being too gloomy? A) I try to be as realistic as possible and tell the truth. There is a lot of uncertainty around the economy right now.  There are some silver linings — inflation looks like it’s turning a corner. If inflation keeps falling, I promise to be more upbeat in the future! Q) Last year you said we’d be in recession for two years, but now it’s only one — what’s changed? A) Gas prices have fallen a lot over the past couple of months. And fixed mortgage rates are a bit lower. Unemployment hasn’t risen as we feared it might. That all puts a few more Pounds back in people’s pockets. Q) You warned people off from asking for wage rises because of inflation but then gave your staff a pay rise.  Why should it be one rule for the Bank and another for the rest of us? A) We’re giving our staff a 3.5 per cent pay rise targeted to those on lower salaries. That’s a fair bit lower than the average at the moment and well below inflation. I didn’t say no pay rises, but rises which try to beat inflation will mean high inflation lasts for even longer and ultimately hurt those on low incomes. Q) Why do you think so many ­over-50s have stopped working and why should they come back to work? A) We don’t know for sure. For some it’s early retirement. For others it’s related to long-term sickness.  Even though the economy is slowing, there are still a lot of job vacancies out there. Near record highs. Q) Why aren’t savings rates rising as fast as interest rates? Savings rates are going up. Do shop around for the best rates and vote with your feet if you feel you aren’t getting the best deal. THE boss of Heathrow is stepping down months after being accused of creating “airmageddon” during a summer of cancelled flights. John Holland-Kaye, who has led Europe’s busiest airport for nine years, was involved in a row with airlines after introducing a cap on passenger numbers during the peak holiday season. The cap, which led to thousands of flight cancellations, lost baggage and long delays, came in as there was not enough workers to handle the rush of holidaymakers. Emirates accused Heathrow of “incompetence and non-action” and called for Mr Holland-Kaye’s resignation. British Airways owner IAG warned a repeat this summer would not be tolerated. Mr Holland-Kaye helped get parliamentary approval to build a third runway at Heathrow but it still has to resubmit its plans and there are doubts about whether it will ever happen. SAUSAGE maker Cranswick has cheered strong sales over Christmas as shoppers gorged on festive porky treats. The firm, which supplies pork and poultry to the UK’s biggest supermarkets, said trading was “particulary robust”. Cranswick, which is investing in more British pigs, also said it had passed on higher product prices to customers. Shares in the firm rose by five per cent, valuing the business at £1.77billion. SUPERDRY founder Julian Dunkerton has been forced by the Takeover Panel to confirm that he will not launch a bid for the company. The regulator told the Cheltenham-based entrepreneur that he had to clear up speculation about taking the business private and he is now banned from making a bid for the next six months. Mr Dunkerton, who still owns a 24 per cent stake, said he had “no plans to do this at the moment”. Superdry shares rose five per cent after his statement. “Nobody warns you about the level of focus thrown upon founders joining the LSE and I’ve had to learn how to roll with the punches”. Matt Moulding, founder of THG, as backers nurse heavy losses on its listing BT is hiking prices by 14.4 per cent next month — about £1 extra a week for its phone service — but still claims it’s “exceptionally good value”. Boss Philip Jansen said the higher-than-inflation rise reflected soaring energy costs. He said “extremely strong” demand had seen a record 155,000 customers connected to its ultra-fast Openreach broadband in three months.

"Food and drink prices could soar because of thefts by cargo hijackers, report finds","FOOD and drink are the commodities most likely to be stolen in the global supply chain, threatening higher food prices in 2023, according to a report published today. Thefts have ‘increased considerably’ this year, with theft of fuel and automotive products also on the rise. The number of cargo hijacking incidents have now been overtaken by thefts from facilities, as revealed in the British Standards Institution’s (BSI) Supply Chain Risk Insights Report 2023. In fact, thefts from hijacking have fallen as a proportion of the cargo theft from 24.4 per cent to 17.0 per cent. They are now second to theft from facilities, which now account for more than a quarter of total thefts, having increased from 24.2 per cent to 26.0 per cent. In February, thieves stole around 4,000 pairs of branded shoes from a truck parked at a motorway interchange South Lanarkshire, estimated to be worth nearly £400,000. And in August, almost £300,000 worth of coffee machines were stolen from a warehouse in Birmingham, with the company’s own forklift used to assist with the theft. It was reportedly the second time the company had been targeted. Susan Taylor Martin, chief executive of the BSI, which compiled the report, said: “2022 saw volatility in global supply chains that many would never have expected in their lifetime. “Successive crises, including a global pandemic followed by a war in Europe, have resulted in continued uncertainty on many fronts and have demonstrated to governments the benefit of ensuring a robust global supply chain. “Given the turbulence of the last twelve months, 2023 will be an important watershed for many organizations – with those that successfully manage their supply chain risks being more likely to thrive. The report also identified five additional imperatives organisations will need to tackle to enable future growth and provide financial sustainability. They include addressing issues around leadership, staying up to date with digital risk, maximising self-knowledge, understanding the challenges in differing sectors, and gaining an understanding of new technologies like the metaverse. Jim Yarbrough, global intelligence program manager at the BSI, added: “The threats facing global supply chains vary from region to region and are distributed unequally, but in the face of rampant global price inflation, all countries ended 2022 in conditions more precarious than they were at the outset. “Without intervention, businesses will see dramatic impacts on their bottom line, meaning that discussing supply chain issues at the C-suite level can help to ensure investments are funnelled to suppliers, building resilience to threats and supporting financial sustainability. “Failure to manage supply chains properly could ultimately mean further increases to food prices, amongst other things in the next 12 months.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/21156290/food-and-drink-prices-soar-thefts/
"Make-up brand Revolution Beauty’s founders ‘fiddled with the books’, probe reveals","A MAKE-UP brand loved by Love Island stars has been found to be fiddling the books. A probe says Revolution Beauty founders gave loans to distributors in return for bumping up orders. Around £9million of sales should not have been counted, said the report. Founders Adam Minto and Tom Allsworth made fortunes when they listed the firm for £500million in 2021. But they did not tell the rest of the board about the secret deals which gave the impression that Revolution’s business was bigger than it is. Auditors had refused to sign off the accounts, which prompted a months-long probe. Investigators highlighted “materially larger than normal” orders sent to distributors just before the year-end with the purpose of meeting sales targets. The sweetheart deals with those distributors included Revolution not having to pay for them until this year. Insiders said the firm — which has tie-ins with Love Island and Amanda Holden — is now stuffed with too much stock. Investigators are also checking the value of Allsworth’s Medichem lab, sold to Revolution for £26million before the flotation. Medichem also sold products from third parties to Revolution for a profit. Self-styled God of Lipsticks Minto has resigned while Allsworth is to step down.

Full list of Britain’s most entrepreneurial cities and towns – is yours on the list?,"WOLVERHAMPTON and Mansfield have been crowned Britain's most entrepreneurial city and town in an annual survey of small businesses. The Midlands communities saw more small businesses (SMEs) launched per head than anywhere else in Britain last year. SME insurance provider Superscript used ONS data to compare the total number of small businesses (with 0-49 employees) per unitary authority in 2021 to the same figure for 2022. This was combined with nationwide population data to generate a 'small business per capita' score. Wolverhampton came out top with a score of 0.48, with other cities including Worcester on 0.20 and Carlisle on 0.19. While towns to see significant growth lead with Mansfield scoring 0.38, followed by Blackburn with Darwen on 0.30 and Luton with 0.22. The increase in small businesses was driven by the accommodation and food service sector, which grew nationally by 4.9 per cent (8,175 more businesses). As well as construction, which grew by 4.25 per cent (15,270 more businesses). Superscript also commissioned a survey of 1,000 small business owners, which found 72 per cent set out on their own because of the potential to earn more than their current job. Cameron Shearer, co-founder and CEO, said: ""It’s encouraging to see so many new entrepreneurial towns and cities make this year’s top 10, while cities like Carlisle and Cardiff consolidated last year’s positions to climb even higher. ""These places have bucked the national trend, with the macroeconomic challenges causing a drop of 83,000 small businesses nationwide. ""However, history teaches us that great ideas and innovations are born out of challenging times, with businesses evolving quickly. ""That is why flexibility and customisation have become the most important insurance requirements of small businesses coming to us for cover."" Jasmin, 41 and Phil Robson, 47, run Hatch To Go in Darlington, which placed fourth for the top towns. The concept emerged following the success of adaptations to their existing business Hatch Luncheonette in 2020 and 2021 where customers still wanted dine-in experiences during Covid. The to-go store now provides retail as well as cakes, snacks and coffee, after Jasmin noticed an opportunity from customers popping in who could browse and pick up last-minute gifts and cards. Jasmin said: ""We use a lot of local suppliers for our takeout shop and in our retail and gift area where we try and concentrate on sourcing independent brands to stock, often focusing on women owned or independent brands that can’t be found on big sites like Amazon. ""We grew up in Darlington and it is lovely to have a business that makes the place where we live better. ""We set the business up as a place we would like to go to as customers."" Superscript’s data also revealed the key factors for entrepreneurs choosing a location for their business, with 15 per cent looking for good access to talent. But for 14 per cent, it’s simply where the would-be business owners happen to already live. Jackie Mulligan, founder of ShopAppy - an online platform for local shops - a government high street task force expert, said: ""The shift of our high streets to more experiential places is a positive opportunity for hospitality businesses in particular. ""It is clear that the growth of businesses in these locations is also connected to positive efforts by local partners (councils and business improvement districts), strong, supportive communities and effective business networks - all key for entrepreneurs in this challenging climate for local economies.""

Aldi boss reveals plans for stores in 2023,"THE Aldi boss wants “Brits to celebrate Christmas without breaking the bank."" It comes as he gears up for the discounter to poach more shoppers from its rivals this month than ever before. In an exclusive interview with The Sun, Giles Hurley, Aldi's chief executive, said the supermarket was gearing up for its biggest Christmas on record as the cost of living crisis has prompted shoppers to switch from every other supermarket. Two-thirds of British households now shop with Aldi for bargain staples but also its cut-price Wagyu beef and bottles of £14.99 Veuve Monsigny, which is now the UK’s second biggest champagne brand after Moet Chandon. In September, Aldi overtook Morrisons to be crowned the UK’s fourth biggest supermarket, and over the past twelve weeks, it’s gained over 1.5 million more shoppers, according to Kantar.   Mr Hurley said: ""We might be in the ‘Big Four’, but we will never be part of that club, we’re focused on our model."" He reasons Aldi’s success is largely down to its smaller stores and grocery ranges while 90 per cent of what it sells is its own brand, so it can sell groceries for less. ""We are committed to not being beaten on price."" Aldi’s rapid market share gains have prompted Tesco and Sainsbury’s to launch their own price-matching scheme to stop an exodus of shoppers. Mr Hurley believes the promotions are a ""feather in our cap because it shows that Aldi is the benchmark on price."" As it has become more of a threat, rival bosses have been quick to point out that Aldi is hiking its prices by more than others and Which? recently confirmed the discounter had raised prices by 19% compared to a year ago. These above inflation hikes have raised concerns that poorer households are squeezed further because there isn’t a cheaper alternative. Mr Hurley defends the grocer saying shoppers care about pounds and pennies, rather than percentages, and Aldi has put the average price of an item up by 12p, less than its nearest competitor which has raised prices by 14p while discount peer Lidl has increased it by 17p. While the cheapest, Aldi is not immune to inflationary pressures and this year its profits dived by 86% to just £36million. Mr Hurley says that not being dictated to by public investors or buyout group’s exit timetables was the ""luxury of private ownership."" ""We can take a long-term view and we believe long-term profitability is linked to growth and scale. ""Our market share and growth is very much determined by us having the lowest food prices in the UK."" Mr Hurley admits that Aldi, which will have 980 stores by the end of this year has fallen short of its target of having 1,000 stores by the end of 2022. He blames the delay on lockdowns, labour shortages, planning red tape and interference from rivals, rather than a lack of ambition. ""We might have slowed down, but we’ll never stop."" It is now racing to open 16 new shops in the last three weeks of this year and Mr Hurley says that it will reach 1,000 stores next year and keep going. There continue to be gaps in the south of the country and the capital. Earlier this year it also launched a cashier-less store in Greenwich, south east London in the style of Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology. ""I don’t think people would have expected innovation like that from this group, but there’s a few ripples that need to be ironed out before we roll it out further."" In January Aldi ditched Deliveroo deliveries and is now concentrating on its click-and-collect service that’s currently from 200 stores. While rival Lidl is steadfastly shunning online sales, Hurley says ""watch this space"" when it comes to rolling out click and collect further. ""Online grocery spending might have slowed, but it’s still 11% of the food market, it’s still going to be important.""

Primark to open four new branches in £140million high street investment plan – is there a location near you?,"PRIMARK is strengthening its commitment to the British high street with plans to invest £140 million in its shops over the next two years. At a time when a number of retailers are shutting stores or going bust, Primark is planning to open four new shops. The new stores will be located in Bury St Edmunds, Craigavon, Salisbury and Teesside Park.  Primark is also relocating its shops to better spots in Bradford and High Wycombe. The investments will boost its UK selling space by 160,000 square foot and create at least 850 new jobs. Primark is taking over the former Debenhams store in Bury St Edmunds in the latest sign of how the British retail landscape has changed since the start of the pandemic. More than 6,000 shops closed in the first half of this year according to the Local Data Company while big chains Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Warehouse, Oasis, Karen Millen switched to online-only after financial troubles.  Primark’s investment into bricks and mortar comes just a week after it finally dipped its toe into online shopping with the launch of click and collect counters in 25 stores.   During lockdowns, Primark lost £1 billion in sales because shoppers could not buy its products online. However, Primark has deliberately focused on click and collect, rather than home deliveries, because it still wants to drive traffic to its high street stores. The trial is so far proving popular with childrenswear and nursery furniture as families can order a wider range than their local store offers. Primark has 190 shops in the UK and employs 30,000 people and has plans to expand to 530 shops internationally in the next four years. The retailer has tried to lure more shoppers to its stores by launching concessions such as a barber, a vintage range, Tasty by Greggs cafes and Disney stores in Belfast, Birmingham and Merry Hill, which opened this week. It has also recreated the ""Central Perk"" cafe from the sitcom Friends in its Manchester store. ""The UK is our biggest market and as we continue to grow and expand our business internationally, we remain as committed as ever to investing on our stores to offer more customers our great value clothing, beauty homewares and more"", said Paul Marchant.

Who owns McDonald’s?,"MCDONALD'S is one of the biggest fast food chains in the world, but not many know who's on the inner circle. We all enjoy a Big Mac or Quarter Pounder with cheese, but where did the chain start and who founded it?  McDonald's has been owned by Kroc since April 1955. Kroc’s first McDonald’s location was opened in Illinois, USA, on April 15 that year. Not long afterwards, Kroc founded McDonald’s System, Inc., known today as the McDonald’s Corporation. In 1961, Kroc bought out the McDonald brothers – the founders of the franchise – for $2.7million (£2million). For the last 60 years, Kroc has owned the exclusive brand name rights of all McDonald’s locations. McDonald's was founded by the McDonald brothers, Richard (Dick) and Maurice (Mac). At the same time as founding McDonald's, the two brothers also created the 'Speedee Service System', now known as 'fast food'. Richard and Maurice McDonald were two American entrepreneurs who founded McDonald's - now the world's largest chain restaurant. The idea for the restaurant came to them in 1937, when they opened a hot dog stand in California, USA, which proved very popular during the car racing season. In 1940, they decided to open a bigger hot dog stand at a different California site, in a bid to attract more customers year-round. Their new restaurant proved a success, and soon the McDonald brothers adapted their business to focusing on hamburgers, milkshakes, and French fries - their most popular items. Richard McDonald died on July 14, 1998, at the age of 89, having outlived his brother, who died aged 69 on December 11, 1971. Ray Kroc was an American businessman, who went into partnership with the McDonald brothers in 1955. In the early 1940s, Kroc became the exclusive distributor in the United States of the “multimixer”, a blender that could simultaneously mix five milkshakes. In 1954, he was intrigued to receive an order for eight of these multimixers from just one restaurant in San Bernardino, California. He visited the restaurant to find the original branch of McDonald’s, being run only by the two McDonald brothers. Impressed with what he saw, Kroc went into partnership with the McDonald brothers the following year, and was the first to suggest franchising the restaurant. Kroc managed to open three McDonald’s restaurants in 1955, including the first franchised restaurant in Illinois. Kroc bought the McDonald brothers out in 1961 – leading some today to believe that he ‘stole’ their enterprise from them. Kroc died on January 14, 1984, with a net worth of $600 million – which today would be the equivalent of $1.4 billion (£1.06 million). His story is told in the 2016 biopic film, The Founder.

There are 38,000 McDonald's restaurants in 100 countries with the vast majority being franchise operations. Buying into one, or building an entirely now store, is a massive emotional and financial commitment. But opening one could lead to mouth-watering returns - between £1.5m and £4.3m a year, according to McDonald's. To invest in a McDonald's franchise, you'll need about 25% of unencumbered funds, or roughly £100,000. The remaining 75% can be funded by a bank, and franchisees may use banks which McDonald's has a relationship with that offer competitive rates. For 80% of restaurants franchised in 2018, the cost of purchasing franchise rights and equipment was between £350k and £1.85m - and this was priced on profitability over a 10-year period. On top of this, you'll need to pay a monthly 5% franchise fee on net sales and a 4.3% contribution to the company's marketing fund. The monthly fee paid by 80% of franchises in 2018 and 2019 ranged between 12.25% and 21% of your restaurant's net sales. The very first McDonald’s restaurant was opened in San Bernardino, California, in May 1940. It does not exist anymore. It was demolished in 1972 – but part of the original famous ‘Golden Arches’ sign, introduced at the site in 1953, still exists. An independent McDonald’s museum was opened on the San Bernardino site in 1998. The oldest existing McDonald’s restaurant today is a drive-up hamburger stand in Downey, California. It was the third McDonald’s restaurant to open, on August 18, 1953.   ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/13350906/who-owns-mcdonalds/
Shoppers could face egg rationing as supermarket bosses warn of shortages,"BRITAIN'S biggest supermarkets are considering putting rations on eggs or importing from Poland as they grapple with looming shortages. Three senior supermarket sources told The Sun that there were now urgent talks across the industry about how to cope with an egg crisis. The shortage of eggs has been partly caused by another outbreak of avian flu but also a delayed knock-on impact from millions of birds dying during the summer’s heatwave. In August the Department of Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs had said that it was ""deeply concerned"" about the scale of chicken mortalities in industrial chicken sheds as birds died from heat exhaustion when temperatures reached record highs. It is understood that a lot of the birds that died were broiler chickens - those reared for consumption rather than laying eggs. This summer was the hottest on record with temperatures passing 40 degrees centigrade or 104 Fahrenheit. The problems have been exacerbated by a number of farmers exiting the industry, with fewer laying hens than ever before, because rising costs has meant that it is harder to make a profit. Farmers have blamed a huge jump in animal feed costs, caused by the war in Ukraine which has sent grain prices soaring. Importing more eggs from abroad will likely lead to higher prices for shoppers, because of additional transport costs, at a time when Brits are already facing soaring food inflation. The price of a box of a dozen eggs has already risen by more than 22 per cent, according to official figures.  While shoppers are now paying 20p more for a dozen eggs, farmers are only receiving another 4p. Ioan Humphreys, an egg farmer in Wales, blamed supermarkets for not paying egg farmers enough. ""The price of new birds has gone up but our price of eggs has stayed the same. We physically can’t afford to produce these eggs"", he said in a social media video.  A spokesman for the British Egg Industry Council said ""Egg supply is fairly tight at present, however, availability does naturally fluctuate in terms of supply and demand and the industry is working closely with retailers to ensure we are able to continue to meet consumer demand for British Lion eggs."" Last year the UK produced 11.3 billion eggs and had to import another 1.4 billion to meet demand.  Britain typically consumes 13.5 billion eggs. The majority of UK eggs are free-range with just over a third produced by hens in cages. Supermarket sources told The Sun that there were already shortages of some eggs, particularly medium sizes. Food manufacturers are already having to turn to overseas egg suppliers to deal with the shortages of ""liquid egg"" which is used widely in baking products.  All turkeys and chicken are now having to be kept indoors to protect birds from avian flu and a rapid escalation on farms. Entire flocks of birds can be culled if they catch the disease. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/20352507/supermarket-egg-rationing-warning-shortage-ingredient-looms/
Inside glam life of £40m brothers who launched clothing empire in their 20s – while one worked for £150 a week in chippy,"WHEN Reiss Edgerton quit university after two years, he found himself back at home with no prospects and direction.  But after launching the multimillion company AYBL Group with his younger brother Kris in 2018, they are now worth a staggering £40million.  With hard work, they are now able to enjoy a life of luxury with expensive holidays to glamorous hotspots like Corfu, Barcelona, and Dubai.    Reiss, 30, also has a stunning influencer girlfriend, a fellow entrepreneur who owns an online clothing store.  Before their success, however, Reiss was embroiled in a scandal that looked set to derail his path while Kris, 28, worked in a chip shop that paid £150-a-week.  Here, we take a look at how the brothers were able to overcome adversity to be named on The Sunday Times Young Rich List.   The brothers grew up with Reiss' friends, Ben Francis and Lewis Morgan, who went on to become the co-founders of the billion pound company Gymshark.  In their teenage years, Reiss and his two friends, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, used to stay up all night to come up with business strategies and ideas.  While in college the trio set up an internet advertising company which made them an impressive £10,000 each.  But while Reiss went off to Nottingham Trent University to study business, his mates set up Gymshark.  Coming to the realisation that university wasn't for him, he quit after two years - only to go back home to Bromsgrove without a plan B, moving in with his grandmother.  Reiss even considered joining the army and said he was just a day away from enlisting and had sworn his oath of allegiance.  Meanwhile, his brother Kris was working in a chip shop and getting paid £150 a week.  However, the entrepreneurial pair turned their fortunes around by going into business with friends selling watches imported from China, a venture that brought in annual sales of £7million.  Reiss told the Sunday Times: ""It did well, but watches are one-off purchases. I wanted something that was more of a brand, where we had more of a relationship with our customers."" After the remarkable success of their firm, the brothers are now living a luxurious life, which they often share on social media.  Reiss has posted pictures of himself at a number of lavish holiday destinations including Corfu, Dubai, and Barcelona.  He is also dating Alice Cross, who alongside the brothers co-founded her online clothing store, Because Of Alice.  Alice, 27, who has over 552,000 followers on Instagram, often posts glamorous pictures flaunting her impressive designer bags and accessories, including a Cartier watch and Jimmy Choo shoes.  Before Reiss hit the big time in 2015, he made headlines when he was kicked off a Jet2 flight with his friend, Joseph Kings, for exhibiting ""aggressive and abusive"" behaviour.  The pair were a part of a group traveling to Ibiza and were reportedly seen being rude to airport security, shoving fellow passengers, and threatening Jet2 employees.  At the time, Phil Ward, who was the managing director of the airline said: ""We are a leisure airline and we simply won’t stand for such rude and disrespectful behaviour.  ""Many passengers on the flight were families travelling with young children, so there was no way we were going to expose them to this aggressive and abusive pair."" After being hit with a six month ban from travelling with the airline, the two friends threatened legal action with Joseph claiming the incident occurred as a result of a ""vendetta"" a flight attendant had against him. No further action was taken by police. After years of good and bad times, the brothers launched AYBL from a spare room of their Bromsgrove home in 2018.  The firm, based in Redditch, manufactures women's clothing such as crop tops, sports bras, and other gym attire in their trademark neutral colours.  In 2020 alone, the brand made profits of £4million on £22million sales of their clothes.  Last year, Reiss' old friend Lewis, who left Gymshark to go into property development investment, bought a 20 per cent stake in their business, bringing its value to £50million.  It also boosted Reiss and Kris's own shares to a whopping £40million.  Earlier this year, the brand was named the fastest growing private company in Britain with annual sales growth over three years pegged at 359.01 per cent.  Celebrating the win on Instagram, Reiss wrote: ""Less than 3 years ago, me and my brother were running the brand out of a spare room in the house and today we employ over 50 people."" For the first time ever, in 2021, the brothers joined their old friends Ben and Lewis on the Sunday Times Rich List after being ranked number 24.  In a post on social media, Reiss alluded to the success of his pals and wrote: ""We've all indirectly contributed to each other's success.  ""There's a lesson to be had here, good friends bring each other up. Too many selfish and greedy people in this world, there's nothing better than sharing success with friends.""

Inside Marks and Spencer’s plans to revamp business after huge shake-up announcement,"FOR almost two decades British shoppers and investors have been waiting for Marks & Spencer to turn itself around. The Sun's business editor Ashley Armstrong gives her verdict after the retailer announced an acceleration of its store closure plans.  The high street retailer has often been accused of being too slow to spot trends, too expensive or attempting to chase after young shoppers and alienating its core customers. Marks & Spencer’s new-ish bosses are now determined to give the retailer some of its mojo back. Stuart Machin, who was promoted to chief executive in May from running the food business, has been focused on sharpening M&S on price and making the business more attractive to family shoppers.  It is still a long way from the destination for many people’s weekly shop, particularly in the cost of living crisis.  But Machin wants people to buy more than just sandwiches and ready meals.  If he can get them to pop into the stores for a treat and a few everyday essentials M&S will be able to start growing its food volumes, rather than just relying on price increases for a sales boost. In fashion, M&S knows it will never be as cheap as Primark without also risking a customer backlash if it abandons some of its quality standards.  However, it has now spent £200million lowering prices including making 60 per cent of this season’s jeans under £30 and reducing the price of its basic lace bras from £12 to £10.  The move should appeal to shoppers on a budget.  On clothing Katie Bickerstaffe, who holds the four-day week post of deputy chief executive, has become obsessed with how M&S can use its wealth of customer data to make sure it’s selling what shoppers actually want to buy.  After all, the business has never been short of being told by the British public where it is going wrong.  Ms Bickerstaffe has championed its recent Good Move athleisure range, which it launched in the early days of the pandemic, as evidence that M&S can move fast when it gets its house in order. The decision to start selling third-party brands two years ago is also attracting newer customers to the business for the first time.  M&S has said explicitly that it would be interested in buying other clothing brands that would fit the business.  After all, while a shopper might visit the website for a Nobody’s Child dress or pair of Clarks children’s shoes, if M&S can convince them to buy a bra or a bag too, that customer can become much more valuable to M&S. After years of playing catch up, M&S has finally woken up to the online opportunity, which is where it is now focusing most of its efforts. It has spent tens of millions of pounds getting its warehouse in Castle Donington in order so it can be more efficient in shipping orders to customer homes.  It is also making more of its 500 store strong network by introducing speedy click and collect points.  Its digital loyalty Sparks card and slicker app means that M&S is finally behaving a bit more like a modern retailer. However, to do this M&S is acutely aware it has to tackle its clunky store estate of expensive stores.  Many of these stores are now in high street locations where footfall has plummeted, meaning they are barely making a profit but still paying huge business rates bills. In 2018, M&S said it wanted to close 100 shops by 2022 as it repositioned its estate to have more food shops and relocate stores to better performing retail parks. The pandemic interrupted its plans.  But now M&S has put the future of its shops back on the agenda.  It wants to shut 67  shops within the next three years - effectively one in four of its big stores.  Insiders say the business is merely accelerating its long held plan.  But the pandemic and rise of online shopping has meant M&S needs to get its house in order faster than ever.  In September, M&S announced it was to give thousands of workers their second pay rise this year. Marks and Spencer has also revealed its menu line up for Christmas - and you can start ordering food now. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/20088335/marks-spencer-plans-business/
Marks and Spencer closures – which M&S stores are closing and how many job losses will there be?,"MARKS & Spencer has announced another round of store closures over the next five years as part of a national shake-up. The struggling upmarket chain today said it plans to close a further 67 stores that have ""lower productivity"". But M&S also announced that it will be opening 104 new ""bigger and fresher"" food stores. The closures are part of 110 that had previously been announced, but the 67 confirmed today shows plans have been accelerated. It hasn't yet been confirmed what will happen to the affected workers. Marks and Spencer is also yet to confirm which stores will be closing, but we will update as soon as we know. It hopes the move will save £300million in the face of the current economic climate.     Last year, The Sun reported that the company was planning to close 30 more stores, while reporting clothing and homeware sales took a blow due to the Covid crisis. This was on top of the 59 clothing and food stores the retailer had already closed, plus 15 food-only sites and eight outlets. The closures were all part of a wider radical restructuring plan first announced in 2016, which aimed to close 110 stores by 2022. Last year, the business said it wanted to reduce its number of clothing and home shops down to 180 from 247 shops - but expand its Simply Food shops from 316 to 420. Marks and Spencer has already closed 68 stores in recent years, but its efforts to cut its rent bill were disrupted by the pandemic. So far, M&S has only confirmed the locations it has closed between 2016 and 2019 - here's what we know about which stores have closed so far... M&S hasn't confirmed a full list of where the 67 stores earmarked for closure announced today are located. But we've asked M&S and we will update you as soon as we can. These are the 35 clothing stores that closed between November 2016 and March 31 2019 - although do note that while six of the stores shut down, these were relocated to other locations within the same area: And these are the 13 clothing stores that closed between April 1 2019 and May 22 2019: M&S announced in 2019 that 25 food stores will close or relocate by April 2024. The retailer said it is focusing on shutting or relocating its smaller, low-volume stores. It will, however, be opening 75 new larger food stores but again we don't know where these will be. M&S closed the following food stores between July 2018 and early 2019 - it said these were separate from its restructuring programme: The following outlet stores were also shut in 2018 and 2019 but M&S said last year that these weren't part of the restructuring programme and added that it didn't have any plans to get rid of any other outlet shops:  In November 2016, the high street chain said that it had marked 100 low-performing stores for closure or change as part of a big 10-year restructuring plan. Stores closures began in April 2017 m when the first six stores were announced for closure. In May 2018, M&S then announced that it was accelerating its plans with over 100 clothes stores due to close by 2022. By May 2019, M&S revised its plans to 120 clothing store closures by April 2024. It says 48 clothing stores have been closed ore relocated until this date. It also added 25 food stores to the firing line, saying they face being axed or relocated. In 2021 the 30 store closures came after a year of high street retailers battling to survive as a result of the Covid crisis. As non-essential shops were ordered to close during a number of national lockdowns over 2020 and 2021, many retailers' sales, including M&S, took a big hit. This year the changes come as it faces a tough consumer backdrop, rising inflation and a £100million hit from soaring energy costs. The retailer has said that it is accelerating up its store overhaul to save around £309million in rent costs. M&S has previously said that it was focused on moving out of tired stores on high streets with low footfall in favour of relocating to retail parks, which continue to prove popular with shoppers. In 2020, both Topshop's owner Arcadia Group and Debenhams collapsed. While Thorntons announced last year that it plans to shut all stores.

Tory grassroots darling Kemi Badenoch to tell New York big wigs that Britain is ‘open for business’,"KEMI Badenoch will tell New York big wigs Britain is back open for business in her first trade mission to the States. The Trade Secretary will say the UK is going big for growth by canning the planned corporation tax rise - and now is the time to jump in and invest in UK PLC. The former wannabe-PM will say Britain has the most innovative and creative economy in the world. And she will continue to push for more state-by-state mini deals to boost trade and create more jobs. Though the visit risks being overshadowed by the fall in the pound and shaky reaction to the Budget, it could make British exports more attractive on the world stage. A source said: ""The government's exciting new pro-growth agenda means there is no better time than now than to invest. ""Boosting transatlantic trade is just the start."" She will speak to 400 CEOs, Wall Street top brass and senior investors today at the Atlantic Future Forum - a summit aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier. And she will meet with Bloomberg and Microsoft, and hold her first trade talks with the US' Katherine Tai. She will say: ""The UK is going for growth in a big way. And we want American partners to join our growth story and benefit from it. ""Just like Manhattan we’re an island full of dynamism and ingenuity. And the message I want to send here in the Big Apple – is that we’re the nation with big ideas."" ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/19939472/kemi-badenoch-britain-open-for-business/
Nearly half of small business owners feel stressed with ‘nobody to confide in’,"Nearly half of small business owners feel they have ""nobody to confide in"" about their problems and the stress they are under, a survey has revealed. As a result, 44% of the 500 SME owners polled feel they're unable to do the best possible job for both them and their staff. Two in three don’t think they can talk to friends or family about the stress they feel – because they don’t want to worry them. While 48% find it hard to know who they can talk to about their business troubles. The cost-of-living crisis (45%), finding new customers (37%) and inflation (35%) are among the things which stress out SME owners. Claudio Gienal, chief executive officer for AXA UK and Ireland which commissioned the research, said: “It can be a very lonely place being an SME owner, which is why it is so important to ensure you can confide in someone who can relate to how you feel. ""Especially for those who have built much of their business alone, it can feel very strange opening up about what is going on in your workplace.  “But for many, taking those first steps and talking through what you are concerned about goes a long way to lifting that burden – it can offer a new perspective on what’s going on, as well as a renewed sense of clarity to the situation. ""When it comes to looking for support, there are many avenues business owners can take; for example, having robust insurance can help to take a weight off the mind.” However, it is a different picture when communicating with members of staff, as 34% of those with employees on the payroll are very open with them about potential issues the business could encounter. While a further 38% will reveal a selected amount of information relating to the problems which they could face. When it comes to their staff wellbeing, 55% said they genuinely care about their staff – and 44% are striving to create a positive work culture. In fact, 40% take an active interest to strengthen the relationship between them and their staff, while 36% believe it is important for staff retention. While two-thirds will check in on their team's wellbeing up to three times on a weekly basis. As well as this, 66% also said they believe small businesses are better at reacting to the concerns of their staff. This is because they are considered to be more in tune with their employees (63%), have fewer formal processes in place (50%), and management is more accessible (49%). And as a result, 65% of those polled, via OnePoll, feel confident managing people who are struggling with their mental health. The research comes in the same week that six small to medium business owners won AXA’s Startup Angel Competition, aimed at celebrating some of the country’s next generation of entrepreneurs. Muihood, a skincare brand rooted in traditional Chinese medicine, and Team Repair, a sustainable subscription service which teaches children science and technology, each won £25,000 and mentorship from some of Britain's best business owners, as well as 12 months of business insurance. Four other businesses won digital advertising campaigns. Charlotte Yau, founder and owner of Muihood, a skincare brand rooted in Chinese medicine, said: “Since launching my own brand over two years ago, I've learned that putting my health and wellbeing first is crucial for maintaining happiness and perspective. “Running a business is a marathon, and sprinting can only get you so far until you feel the effects mentally and physically. “Looking after your mental health will help you gain perspective on what really matters and also give you the energy to keep going and not feel resentful in the job. ""If you never allow yourself to rest, hard work will always feel like punishment. “Being the boss is really hard and will consume a lot of your headspace, so having a healthy disconnect to pause and reflect on the bigger picture is so important.” Claudio Gienal, chief executive for AXA UK and Ireland, added: “To thrive in business, it is so important to have open and honest relationships – and it is fantastic to learn many are doing their utmost to harness positivity in their workplace. “Many SME owners really recognise the importance of wellbeing and are doing everything in their power to create a space where members of staff feel comfortable talking about their concerns. “Yet, they mustn’t forget to also look after themselves as well, particularly if they are going through tough times. ""We want to give our customers the confidence to thrive, so we’re pleased to see so many businesses feeling optimistic about what lies ahead . “As we look to a positive future for SME owners, I’m delighted to congratulate the winners of AXA’s Startup Angel Competition, who will each receive significant support to help their innovative business succeed.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/19920781/small-business-owners-feel-stressed-nobody-confide/
The five ‘hats’ every small business owner wears – and ten tips to manage them all,"Four in 10 business owners and decision makers have taken on other roles within the workplace after letting staff go because of the cost-of-living crisis. A study of 500 small business owners and decision makers estimate they have to wear five different ‘hats’ every single day – including running finances, sales and marketing. Others have been involved in admin (32%), advertising (31%) and HR (27%). But 61% admitted they still get confused about how to do things on a day-to-day basis. Areas decision makers have struggled with included cleaning (15%), operations (14%) and events (14%). It also emerged the most common concerns among management included managing business expenses (26%), staff pensions (25%) and ensuring wages are fair (23%). Tax declarations, maternity and paternity schemes and health and safety reports also cause headaches for those trying to run a business. Sharon Ellis, from Virgin Money, which commissioned the study to launch the new Marketplace tool, said: “Running a business isn’t as straight forward as people might think. “There are so many areas to a business from finance and accounts to HR and marketing and sales – the list goes on. “It’s impossible to be equally skilled in all areas, but the results show many decision makers high up at businesses and even owners have dabbled in all areas to keep things going. “We know that small business owners are time poor and are looking for new ways to navigate the changing world around them, that’s why we launched Marketplace. “We’re on a mission to make business owners’ lives a bit easier across a range of areas, from tax returns to invoicing and HR admin to insurance.” The study also found further reasons for owners and bosses taking on other roles included staff being on furlough (36%), sick leave (36%) or maternity (35%). But 62% believe it’s impossible to be skilled in all areas of the business, while 38% admitted they have made a significant mistake due to not being confident in a specific skill. And while 52% do not have a personal assistant, in an ideal world a PA would manage meetings (40%), general admin (37%) and inboxes (37%). However, some have hired external help to assist with technical issues (39%), setting up salary systems (37%) and tax declaration (33%). It also found 23% admitted the day to day running of a business is harder than they initially expected, leaving them feeling stressed (29%), tired (28%) and confused (27%). A further 28% have also felt overworked, with those polled, via OnePoll, typically working outside of their contracted hours four days a week. And 45% do so on weekends to get everything done. Gone are the days of nine to five though as the typical owner or decision maker starts work at 7:32am and finishes at 5:57pm. If they were to have more spare time off work 28% would spend it with family, while 24% would enjoy socialising. Virgin Money worked with TV presenter and finance expert James Max to offer tips on how to balance and manage workloads. Do it now Don't put off what you can get done now until later. Write a list Regularly update it and keep the most important things at the top. Do it well, do it once Sloppy work only leads to things needing to be done again. And it leaves a terrible impression. Attention to detail How irritating is it to have something incorrectly addressed to you? Exactly. So it's the small details that make the biggest impression. Do be enthusiastic about what you do  But remember that it's a marathon, not a sprint. Don't pile so much pressure on early success forgetting that a new business takes time to build. Don't get despondent  If you've started up a new business, you'd hope it's the best thing ever, but it may take a while to convince others.  Set achievable goals and targets. It's better to smash through them rather than always miss.  Similarly, don't set your targets too low. Good business doesn't tread water. Think about your messaging Flashy and expensive adverts are for big and established brands. You can still be clever and targeted by using social and digital media.  And a clear selling point, well executed and you'll find an audience. Never forget, your best audience is your existing audience. Thank you It's amazing how far a heartfelt thanks to your team and people you work with will go.  Especially if you notice what they've actually done and why it made a difference. Fixing problems  Everyone knows that things go wrong. It's how you fix the problem that will define you and your business.  Never underestimate the value of a referral from someone who's impressed.  And never underestimate the damage from an unhappy customer or client too. And finally Pay your invoices by return. Everyone loves a company that pays their bills quickly and without a fuss.

Warning UK inflation could hit 20% as recession looms – what could it mean for you?,"INFLATION in Britain could be higher than 20 per cent next year if gas prices keep soaring, according to the latest gloomy predictions from economists at Goldman Sachs. The US bank has said that it expects Brits will suffer another 80 per cent increase in energy costs next year as gas prices continue to climb.  That would be on top of the trebling in average bills to £3,549 in October that is already unaffordable for one in three households. As a result of these huge energy pressures, Goldman Sachs reckons headline inflation could now peak at 22.4 per cent next year.  As a result, this could trigger a 3.4 decline in gross domestic product. Inflation refers to the rate that prices are rising.  The costs of goods and services have already risen by 10.1 per cent compared to last year -a 40 year high - as companies have faced higher  wages, ingredients, commodity , transport and energy costs. Goldman Sach’s grim prediction would mean inflation would be more than ten times higher than the Bank of England’s targeted 2 per cent rate.  And it would be even higher than the Bank’s bearish forecasts at the start of the month that inflation could peak at 13.3 per cent this autumn. Last week economists at Citi said that inflation could peak at 18.6 per cent. Goldman Sachs said it expected a recession to start in the UK in October with the economy shrinking by 0.6 per cent next year, less than the 1.5 per cent drop expected by the Bank of England. The US bank added to a growing chorus of predictions that interest rates will rise by another 50 basis points to 2.25 per cent in September. At the start of August, the base rate - which impacts the cost of borrowing and mortgages for Brits - was raised by 0.5 percent - the biggest jump in 27 years to 1.75 per cent.  Parents have been warned that nappy and baby wipe prices have rocketed due to soaring inflation.  When inflation is higher it means prices are rising more quickly and so your money won't stretch as far. Wage are not increasing at the same pace as inflation - which means a ""real term"" pay cut. xperts say you should keep your savings in a high-interest savings account when inflation soars. That way, your balance should keep in line with rising prices. The Bank of England has hiked interest rates for a fifth consecutive time, at 1.25%. But they are still very low by historical standards meaning savings accounts can't keep up with inflation either. In order to battle inflation, you should keep an eye out for own-brand food products when you can, as well as seeing what help and funds are available. For example, the Household Support Fund is there to hand out cash funds and supermarket vouchers to those who need it - it differs depending on which council you're under. If you're struggling with soaring energy bills, a number of energy firms have hardship funds which offer grants of up to £750 for those struggling with their bills. If you're feeling helpless, our Squeeze Team is a panel of experts full of tips and advice to help you cut costs. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/19656828/inflation-warning-uk-recession/
Nestle reduces tubs of favourite Christmas sweet Quality Street,"NESTLE is reducing tubs of toffee pennies and strawberry delights.  Tubs of Quality Street have been shrunk again meaning shoppers will be paying the same for even fewer green triangles, toffee pennies and strawberry delights than before. Nestle has decreased Quality Street tub sizes from 650 grams to 600 grams but is charging the same price of £4. It is also downsizing the confectionary brand’s smaller cartons from 240 grams to 220 grams, according to The Grocer.  This is the first time the chocolate giant - which also makes KitKats - has squeezed Quality Streets in four years after being heavily criticised for its annual policy of ripping off customers.  In 2018 Nestle reduced the standard tub size from 750 grams to 720 grams having shrunk the tubs by 40 per cent over the last decade. A Nestle spokesman told The Grocer: “A new Quality Street range with formats, sizes, weights and rsps based on a range of factors, including the cost of manufacturing, ingredients and transport, and the preferences of our customers and consumers.” Shrinkflation is the phenomenon of pack sizes falling while prices remain the same and a number of the world’s biggest household brands are at it. Companies including Nestle, Flora, Unilever, Reckitt Benckiser, Cadbury’s, Richmond sausages, Kleenex, and Mars have all been steadily shrinking pack sizes but sticking with the same price in a move to combat rising costs. Tubs of Flora recently shrunk from 500g to 450g but the price has stayed the same as owner Upfield deals with soaring sunflower oil costs, caused by the war in Ukraine.  Nestle has recently reduced their Aero sharing bags by 7 per cent from 201g to 218g and M&M crispy pouches by 13 per cent down from 246g grams to 213 grams despite both chocolate bags saying “more to share”, Magnum has shrunk its chocolate covered ice creams from 110 ml to 100 ml but kept packs of four at £3.  Raw ingredient prices, packaging, staff costs and shipping have all become significantly more expensive in the past year  and companies are now passing that on to shoppers.  Official figures showed this week that the cost of making food has now hit record levels which has led to big consumer companies trying to push higher prices on supermarkets. However, supermarkets are conscious that cash-strapped shoppers will switch to cheaper rivals and argue that they make a quarter of the profit margins that consumer groups do. For example Unilever’s profit margin was 18.4 per cent last year while Tesco’s was 4.5 per cent.  ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/19627585/nestle-reduces-tubs-of-favourite-christmas-sweet-quality-strteet/
Cadbury owner charges MORE for low-sugar sweets as pack sizes shrink,"HEALTHIER versions of Brits’ favourite sweets have had their pack sizes shrunk but cost more than their sugary originals. Dairy Milk maker charges customers more for low sugar versions and shrinks pack sizes.  Cadbury owner Mondelez has rejigged top-selling brands to contain 30 percent less sugar - ahead of restrictions promoting products high in fat, sugar and salt (HFSS) coming into force in October. The company’s traditional Maynards Bassetts Wine Gums cost £1.50 for 190 grams but its “30 percent less sugar” version is £1.25 for 130 grams, 23 per cent more expensive for nine fewer sweeties. Mondelez’s overhaul of its Cadbury cocoa powder is also ripping-off consumers. Its ""30% less sugar"" tin costs £3 at Sainsbury's, while a standard full-sugar jar is just £2 at the same grocer - a huge 50 percent markup.  The new low-sugar cocoa version at 280g stretches to an average of six more cups of hot chocolate than the 250g original - but gram for gram consumers are forking out an extra 34 per cent more at the till. When Mondelez launched its “Dairy Milk 30% less Sugar” bar , the chocolate was 22 per cent smaller than the standard version but still cost the same amount.   Mondelez said that it took its UK team of 20 scientists and nutritionists two years to achieve. A new series of rules on the promotion of HFSS foods is due to hit England and Wales this autumn.  The legislation restricts food and drink firms' in-store promotions of fatty, salty and sugary treats.  A Mondelez International spokesman said: ""Our non-HFSS recipes require reformulation techniques which are complex and require investment, and often use recipes which are more expensive to make.  ""All of this is reflected in our recommended retail price. ""Retailers are free to set prices in store and these don't always fully align to our recommended retail price."" Earlier this year it blamed inflation for shrinking the size of its Dairy Milk sharing bars by 10 per cent but keeping the price the same.

Fine wines to be produced up North as UK gets balmier,"FINE wines could soon be produced further North and West as Britain gets balmier.  Experts reckon much of the UK will be competing with France to make the world’s best plonk possibly because of climate change.  The South East and East are already more than 1C warmer during the growing season compared to the 1980s.  And with temperatures expected to rise by as much as another 1.4C by 2040, conditions here will be similar to wine regions Champagne and Burgundy.  Parts of south-central England and Lincolnshire will also be suitable for vineyards, along with areas of southern and north-eastern Wales, according to the University of East Anglia.  Lead researcher Dr Alistair Nesbitt, from winery consultancy Vinescapes, said: “If warmer growing seasons continue, we can expect to see a northward expansion of viticulture in the UK.”  Even before the findings, which are published in the journal OENO One, the amount of land used to produce UK wine had expanded by nearly 400 per cent since 2004.

Millions of EasyJet customers could get thousands of pounds in compensation – how to claim,"EASYJET customers who were targeted in a cyber attack and had personal details stolen could receive thousands in compensation.  In May 2020, the low-cost airline revealed 9million customers had been affected by the ""highly sophisticated"" breach. Holidaymakers' sensitive personal information was taken by hackers, including financial details. But, it is believed travellers could claim for compensation which could be worth thousands of pounds each. Customers who may be eligible to claim are being urged to sign up asap. It comes as EasyJet cancelled dozens of flights since last weekend, with some travellers left stranded either abroad or at home. The airline cancelled 60 flights today alone. Anyone who believes they had their information compromised in the hack two years ago - either personal or financial - can join the claim for compensation. There's no guarantee of a payout and collective claims of this type which are new in the UK, have not yet been fully tested in court. Gene Matthews, partner at Leigh Day, said earlier today it seemed ""most likely"" the law firm would start legal proceedings ""later this year"". He added: ""Leigh Day continues to be approached by hundreds of people who have been affected by the EasyJet data breach and we currently represent almost 4,000 clients. ""We are working alongside a number of other law firms to ensure our clients receive full compensation for what has happened to them."" British Airways agreed last July to pay compensation to some customers who were victims of a similar data breach after reaching a settlement before it reached court. Law firm PGMBM, which represented the BA customers, also brought a group action claim on behalf of EasyJet customers. Group action is similar to a class action lawsuit in the US, where multiple people can be represented in one claim together. A Group Litigation Order (GLO) as it's known in the UK, means the courts can treat similar claims as one rather than having hundreds or even thousands of separate individual ones. The law firm is one of several representing claimants and is doing it on a no win, no fee agreement. That means there is no cost to sign up, but the firm will take a cut of any payout if the claim is successful to cover legal costs and that can be as much as 30%. An EasyJet spokesperson said last July: “The BA announcement is an entirely unrelated matter and arises out of different facts and circumstances. “While some class action law firms continue to encourage easyJet customers whose data may have been compromised to pursue claims, this does not mean that customers have viable claims to compensation.""  The airline added it would ""vigorously contest such claims"". First of all, you need to have had your personal data compromised by the breach to be in line for compensation. EasyJet should have emailed you between April and July 2020 if you were a victim of the hack. Customers affected booked easyJet flights or holidays between October 17, 2019 and March 4, 2020. You don't need to have lost any money as a result of the breach to claim. If your data was leaked in the breach you can join a collective action and there are several of them. Each GLO represents many claimants, but each GLO is a separate case. USE the following tips to protect yourself from fraudsters. Law firm PGMBM has a website where you can register to join their claim at theeasyjetclaim.com. There's no guarantee you will get a payout and the legal process for claiming can be lengthy. Once enough people have joined the claim, a court has to approve it can go forward as a GLO. This can be followed by appeals from both sides, and that's even before the case itself is heard. A claim might be settled, like in the case of BA, before it reaches court but again there's no guarantee of that. There is no deadline set yet for victims to join the action, but the lawyers are encouraging people to come forward if they've been affected. If the case is won then it's likely that firms will take a chunk of the compensation pay out as a fee - and this could be as much as 30% of the cash.  One million drivers could get a payout worth as much as £2,500 each over allegations of car emissions test cheating by lawyers who are preparing a legal claim. Millions of Brits could be in line for a £300 payout after a landmark lawsuit against Mastercard on behalf of consumers was given the go ahead. LAWSUITS that result in compensation for many people are often referred to as ""class action"". In England and Wales a Group Litigation Order (GLO) is often used for this kind of lawsuit, Collective action has been made easier under the UK’s Consumer Rights Act 2015. It means the courts can treat similar claims as one, rather than having hundreds or even thousands of separate individual claims. There are a number of stages to bringing this kind of lawsuit, including the courts needing to give permission for a GLO. Both sides can also appeal decisions at various stages making it a lengthy process with no guarantee of a payout. Collective actions are rare - there have only been around 100 cases since 2000 according to the HM Courts and Tribunals Service. Since the changes in 2015, there has been only one mass claim launched. A court ruled in late 2020 that a case against Mastercard could go ahead after initially being thrown out in 2017.

Easy way to get a refund on a flight if you miss it due to airport queues and chaos,"THOUSANDS of travellers continue to have their holiday plans disrupted after airlines cancelled or delayed flights out of the UK. Earlier today, EasyJet customers were told there were no more flights home from Portugal for a week, leaving travellers stranded. British Airways, Ryanair, Tui and Wizz Air have also cancelled hundreds of flights between them at short notice. It comes after some UK airports were left in chaos last week following mass delays and cancellations. But there are ways to glean something positive out of a negative situation if you have been left stuck abroad or at home. According to Martin Lewis' MoneySavingExpert, if your flight is cancelled, you're due an alternative one, or a full refund. And if it's less than 14 days before departure, you might be owed hundreds in compensation too. The amount you are due will depend on the length of time between cancellation and the date you were due to fly, as well as the distance you were due to travel. For example, if your flight was cancelled less than seven days before departure, is between 1,500 to 3,500 kilometres in distance, and lands up to three hours after the due time, you can claim £168 back. For customers currently stranded, Rory Boland, Which? travel editor, offered further advice on getting flights refunded and more: Some airports have been packed with travellers stranded waiting for flights out of the UK. Some holidaymakers are also turning up early to check-in, which is creating extra congestion. But Rory said if you miss your flight due to lengthy security queues caused by the extra people, you are ""unlikely"" to get your money back. ""The airline will argue that what goes on at security is down to the airport staff to control."" However, there is an alternative. If you miss your flight because queues stopped you from boarding, you can try a method called chargeback. This is where you ask your bank to reverse a payment and is possible if a company fails to deliver goods you have paid for, in this case a flight. However, it is up to your bank to decide if your case is legitimate, and you will have to prove you arrived at the airport well ahead of departure and only missed the flight because of check-in delays due to lack of staff. You should be able to make any claims through your banking app by pressing the ""help with this transaction"" button or something similar. And, if you paid by credit card, you could claim under the Consumer Credit Act, section 75, for breach of contract. Yet, if the queues were at security instead of check-in it may be harder to claim because this is the responsibility of the airport and your contract will be with the airline. If your flight has been delayed or cancelled, and you're flying from the UK or EU, to the UK with a British carrier, or to the EU with an EU or British carrier, your airline should step in under what's known as the Denied Boarding regulation, Rory said. ""Under this rule, airlines should reroute you via any reasonable route - even if it means with a rival carrier,"" Rory said. ""Airlines are responsible for the baggage they allow you to check in,"" Rory said. ""If your luggage doesn't arrive, report it at the airport and be sure to get a copy of the report and the handling agent's contact details."" Rory said a useful tip is to have some of your personal contact information on your case, as this can help you locate it if it gets lost. Rory said that despite travel opening up again post-Covid, booking still carried a risk. But, he added: ""If you are booking, choosing a good insurance provider and a holiday with a flexible booking policy remains the best way to protect yourself from potential disruption.""

Risks to small business owners during the cost of living crisis revealed,"THE biggest threats facing small business owners over the next year include paying back Government COVID loans, lack of consumer spending, and hefty fuel price increases. A poll of 1,000 SME bosses found two thirds of those who have been running their business since before the pandemic admit the last two years have been the most challenging since they started their venture. Nearly half of them (47%) fear the next 12 months could prove even more difficult. Other obstacles identified include managing their own mental health and uncertainty over Anglo-international relations. And three in five (62%) small business owners have suffered from sleepless nights due to worrying about their business. More than one in 10 (12%) think there is a strong possibility that they will go out of business within the next 12 months. This is despite 44% working weekends, 36% going six months or more without a holiday and a third working seven-day weeks on a regular basis. But one sixth of SME owners are hoping the Platinum Jubilee extended Bank Holiday will provide a much-needed boost in profits, and a third are waiting for Christmas to increase their sales. Ben Ramsden, head of SMEs at PayPal UK, which carried out the study, said: “Financial woes and stress can have a negative impact on health and wellness. “In tough times, staying on top of their finance wellness is a vital tool for small business owners. “It needs to be a priority to minimise the personal impact of running a business, which can be an isolating and challenging experience for entrepreneurs.” Given the current challenges, three in five admit to finding running their business stressful. Furthermore, a quarter ignore the financial health of their business, worried about what the true picture is. However, encouragingly SMEs are trying to take more control of their financial wellness by upskilling themselves by using finance apps (31%) and learning from past mistakes (53%). As a result, 56% feel more financially savvy following the uncertainty of the global pandemic. Over a quarter (27%) feel back in control of their own business after experiencing such uncertainty and one in five (21%) feel more empowered as a business owner since improving their knowledge of their business’ finances. And having a financially healthy business will start to create new opportunities for small business owners, according to the research, by OnePoll. This includes having more self-confidence as a leader (45%), having savings for the future (42%) and experiencing less stress (39%). Ben added: “We have launched a number of solutions and PayPal’s Business of Change: Wellbeing & Empowerment report, to arm business owners with practical advice for managing their financial wellbeing and to help set themselves up for success in 2022.” Sandy Ruddock, small business owner and co-Founder of Scarlett & Mustard said: “Our biggest challenge has been the rising cost of raw materials but we’re reluctant to raise our prices to avoid impacting our customers – it’s a lot of pressure to deal with. “Since relaunching our website last year however, our sales have increased with 80% now being made online solely via PayPal. ""It has really helped to ease some of the associated stress and I’d certainly recommend other small business owners who are feeling the strain to invest in their social media presence to drive online growth further.” To get practical advice on how to manage business finances visit - https://www.paypal.com/uk/brc/topics/build-business-resilience Do you have a story for The Sun Online Money team?

The Sun’s £5k grant helped me get a new van and powerwasher for my bin business,"ENTERPRISING Adele Clarke has cleaned up with her £5,000 grant, giving her the boost she needed to set up her own wheelie bin cleaning business. The mum-of-two from Doncaster, South Yorks, said: “It’s tough and dirty work but I can do it around the school run and provide for my family. “I know to a lot of people it might seem like a rubbish job but it’s my little business and I’m proud of it. “I may only work a few hours a day but for those hours I feel so much pride because I am doing it all by myself.” Adele, 38, was making do with an old van that had done more than 200,000 miles and was constantly in need of repair. It finally went kaput three weeks before the grant came through. Adele said: “I’ve been able to buy a new van and a new power washer, so it’s been a massive help. “I’m going to get some signs made up to put on the sides and I’ve bought some leaflets and I will start leafleting for the summer and really push on.” Adele Clarke: WILL and Eoin Duggan, from Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, dreamed of running a mobile bar at outdoor events. So when the first lockdown left them both furloughed, they decided to launch the business. They found an old horse box for sale and did it up. Will, 24, and Eoin, 26, have weddings booked and their aim is to expand. Will said: “The Sun grant is brilliant.” COMPUTER expert Azzer, 38, from Huddersfield, West Yorks, is working on a mobile app to let blind people connect to online multiplayer text-only games. Azzer, who is bedbound and preparing for surgery on his spine, has bought himself a new Macbook to replace his ten-year-old computer. He said: “Having something better and modern to use is a huge improvement for me.” RUBY, 19, set up her jewellery business while studying for her GCSEs and soon sold more than 1,000 items worldwide. The jewellery, made to customers’ designs, is created from scratch from the bedroom desk in Bristol where she used to do her homework. The grant lets her buy more materials and the equipment to sell at pop-up market stalls. JOINT Force Alba is the only Scottish ex-military recruitment consultancy offering support to veterans and helping businesses to use the pool of talented former forces personnel. Emma, 36, from West Lothian, said: “We are in the process of implementing a new customer relationship management system to increase our efficiency and this grant has been really useful.” GEORGIA, 27, from Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, lost her travel job during Covid but began making non-toxic, biodegradable cleaners – “like bath bombs for loos”. Thanks to the grant, she can move into new premises with large moulds for mass production. Georgia said: “It’s a massive step forward.” JOE grew up in a single-parent family in Wakefield, West Yorks – an area with one of the UK’s lowest rates of social mobility. The 24-year-old set up Zero Gravity social media platform to connect low-income students with university mentors. He says: “We signed up 1,000 mentors in the first year then doubled that to 2,000. Now we can double it again.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/18732694/new-van-bin-business/
I design clothes just for curvy women with big boobs and The Sun gave me £5k to expand,"FORMER fashion buyer Jayne Lasley used her Sun grant to design clothes for big-busted women – including a hit leather jacket which has taken the internet by storm. After losing her job during lockdown, Jayne stumbled on her old university fashion design collection while clearing out her garage and decided to use it as an online style guide for curvy girls like her. She set it up under her maiden name Fairlie and within weeks, her Instagram page had 1,000 followers clamouring to buy her designs.  She decided to go into business and was soon sending orders across the globe. Jayne said: “As much as designing and developing the range after all these years makes me happy, it’s the feedback that really brings me joy. “I’m so pleased that this 42-year-old mum of two has been able to start her dream business and can make ladies feel good about themselves.” Jayne has moved into larger premises in Paisley to cope with demand and, with the grant money, has been able to buy more stock and to launch new ranges, including her now famous zip-up leather jackets and evening dresses. She said: “The Sun grant has definitely helped.” Jayne Lasley:  FOODIE Andrew Reid struggled to train as a surveyor when his college closed during lockdown and lessons were moved on to Zoom. But the healthy microwaveable meals that he was preparing for himself and his girlfriend each week proved so popular with pals that he realised he could make a business out of it. He and chef friend Robert Noble, 27, began prepping meals from their local rugby club kitchen in Glasgow but were soon cooking up to 700 each weekend and rapidly outgrew the premises and the cooking equipment. The news of their successful application for a Sun grant came at the perfect time for the pair to taste success. They have now moved into a former Chinese take-away where they are able to prepare meals and open a café. Andrew, 25, said: “We believe our company is unique as our menu changes weekly and just as restaurants do themed nights, so does Prep To Plate. ""But we needed better equipment. Now things are really moving forward. This has helped us massively.” Andrew Reid: ECO expert Anthony Ajanaku set up his plastic waste management business in 2020 to develop planet-friendly ways to reuse single-use plastics. The Cambridge-based firm is creating bespoke methods, including waste sortation units  to capture different plastics,  separate them and recycle them. Engineer Anthony, 34, said: “Thanks to the grant we have been able to hire an apprentice research-and-development analyst to help us look at different plastics and find the best ways to convert them into reusable materials. “We are also looking at buying a 3D printer to use recycled plastic to make things like phone cases. “It is all helping in our goal to reduce the amount of plastic waste ending up in incinerators or landfill. “We want to reuse, repurpose, remanufacture and refurbish as much plastic waste as possible and to develop environmentally friendly and sustainable alternatives to single-use plastics. “We are really excited, so thank you so much to The Sun and Camelot.” Anthony Ajanaku: THEO PAPHITIS is one of the UK’s top entrepreneurs and the force behind big-name brands Boux Avenue, Robert Dyas and Ryman.

I’m so grateful The Sun gave me £5k to boost my marketplace for black-owned businesses,"SAVVY Grace Trowbridge left her marketing job in the leisure industry intending to start her own property business. But, after moving from London to Petersfield, Hampshire, at the height of the pandemic, she found that it was much harder than she had envisioned. Instead, she decided to set up an online marketplace where independent black-owned businesses could promote themselves. Now her award-winning Simply Noir website hosts more than 60 companies, selling a diverse range of high-quality products. Grace, 37, who has two young children, stressed that her business is more than just a sales platform. She said: “We also support black businesses by running business workshops and mentoring sessions and offering external PR and guidance on getting the best out of social media.” The £5,000 grant will help Simply Noir develop an app and sponsor two other businesses – Beau Polish and Softly Shea. Grace said: “We are so thankful, and feel fortunate that we can use this money to help other companies to grow and employ more people.” Grace Trowbridge: START small but dream big! Last year The Sun and lotto firm Camelot teamed up to give away a whopping £250,000 to help small start-up businesses across the nation. Together we offered a life-changing £5,000 grant to would-be business owners with a bright idea who needed cash to get going, or to existing so-called “kitchen table” companies hoping to supercharge their growth. We had thousands of entries from amazing entrepreneurs aged 17 to 70, each hoping to play their part to keep the UK going under lockdown. Each and every one was judged by our panel of stars, including top entrepreneurs, celebrities and industry experts. Today – one year on – we’re catching up with some of our 50 winners to reveal how they’ve transformed their lives, their businesses and the communities of which they are a part. Our great big giveaway for small businesses has seen scores of Brits get back into work and set up some of the UK’s most innovative and exciting new companies. Lady Karren Brady CBE, top businesswoman and Sun Kitchen Table Entrepreneur judge, said: “Times are tough right now so it’s hugely inspiring to see so many of The Sun and Camelot-backed small businesses flourishing.  “Running your own business can be life changing and I’m so proud of all The Sun winners have achieved.” And our 50 winners are not alone. The latest Business Statistics bulletin shows there were 810,316 new businesses launched in the financial year ending in 2021 – up almost 22 per cent on 2019. So if you’re keen to get started, read about the inspiring entrepreneurs who won £5,000 in our contest. By Nigel Railton ONE of the great privileges of my job is I get to see with my own eyes the difference that the National Lottery makes up and down the country. That’s why I was so proud for Camelot to back The Sun’s brilliant Kitchen Table Entrepreneurs campaign last year. After all, making sure as much money as possible goes towards life-changing projects is incredibly important to us. In fact, it’s what gets us out of bed in the morning. For every ticket sold, a hefty slice of the money received goes to a huge variety of projects, from designing clothes for curvy women to preparing healthy, affordable meals for people. Remember, every time you play the National Lottery, the UK wins. To date, National Lottery players have helped to raise over £45BILLION for good causes, with more than 660,000 individual awards made across the UK — the equivalent of more than 235 lottery grants in every UK postcode district. I hope you’ll agree these are impressive statistics. But behind these big numbers are real human stories. And you can read similar stories in The Sun today about the sheer ingenuity our Kitchen Table Entrepreneurs have shown to deserve their grants — and what they are doing with the money. Lockdown forced many of us into thinking about what we could do with the rest of our lives. At a time when the UK economy needs everyone pulling together, I think it’s truly humbling to see what these fantastic kitchen table entrepreneurs have been up to. These guys are proof that with a bit of talent and a lot of determination, there’s nothing that can’t be achieved. If you’ve ever played a National Lottery game, thank you. Have a read, and marvel at how your contribution is helping these small businesses dream big. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/18732530/sun-black-businesses-marketplace/
Employees urged to use auto- response generator to stay professional when they lose their cool,"AN online response generator has been created to help workers remain professional – even when colleagues and clients drive them to lose their cool. Rather than ranting on email or blowing your top on a phone call, the tool allows you to choose what you would really like to say to a colleague or customer, before giving you a more professional version. The tongue-in-cheek generator was created after research of 2,000 office workers which found three in five have ended up losing their cool at work. The top thing to cause people to lose their temper was unreasonable colleagues, followed by a big workload and making mistakes. Third in the list was computer issues, with 22% most likely to lose their cool over technology. But 45% admitted their colleagues are more often the cause. The research found other things which make worker’s blood boil are smelly lunches, colleagues doing online shopping and dirty toilets. A spokesperson for Andrews Air Conditioning, which commissioned the study and tool,  said: “We’ve all been there. Desperate to say what we really think but bound by being professional and polite. “So, we think this tool is a great way to vent your frustration while still keeping your cool. “Workers can turn to the tool if struggling to word an email in a professional manner to ensure they don’t later regret what they said.  “We know how easy it is to lose your temper, particularly in the workplace whether it’s colleagues, clients or customers, but it’s important to think before acting rash.” The study also found 69% wish there was a way to turn what they actually want to say into more professional language. And 60% would like to lose their cool less frequently. A quarter admitted they often regret it when they see red in work and as a result 23%% have had to take a break, 18% have confronted someone and 16% have even shouted out loud. On average, workers lose their cool twice a week, but 59% believe their colleagues do so more frequently than them. But 43% admitted to making rash decisions when losing their cool at work, with 11% walking out and one in 10 writing a passive aggressive email. Further consequences were revealed as being disciplined, ruining a relationship with a colleague and even one in 20 being fired. To try and stop their blood boiling, 29% have walked away from a situation in the workplace, while 13% have simply made a cup of tea. While 11% of those polled via OnePoll have counted to 10 before reacting. The spokesperson for Andrews Air Conditioning added: “The study shows that cooler temperatures help people stay calmer and react less rashly. “We believe at least if it’s temperate in the office it’s one less thing to stop workers going over the edge.” TOP 30 THINGS THAT MAKE OFFICE WORKERS LOSE THEIR COOL: In other business news, a study has revealed people are too frightened to become their own boss. The Sun shares our top ten tips for a successful small business, including having social media and a small energy provider. Research has revealed that small business owners want to go greener - but they don't know how. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/18725968/online-response-generator-help-employees-remain-professional/
Ten top tips for a successful small business – including having social media and a renewable energy provider,"Owners of SMEs which have grown over the last two years have shared their top tips on how to survive - and thrive - during tough economic times. Jordan Perata from Kilo, a zero-waste shop in North London, Josh Kay from experiential design agency The Syrup Room in Bournemouth, and Tash Gorst from Gather, a social enterprise in Peckham, have all seen their companies prosper during the last two years. A key survival tactic for Tash at Gather was being able to pivot the company’s organisations quickly. For example, increasing their social media presence and providing a ‘click and collect’ service for vulnerable customers. Gaining the customer’s trust and keeping them informed of any changes were also pivotal in trading during the pandemic. All the businesses have also taken measures to become smart with their energy usage to lower their overheads amid rising costs. Standard light fixtures at Jordan’s London shop have been replaced with LEDs and the store runs solely on renewable resources. Similarly, The Syrup Room uses a fleet of only electric cars and vans. Tash, from Gather, said: “As a business with an environmental mission, we're hyper aware of our energy use. “For the sake of the planet and future generations, we all need to use less energy, and be more efficient with the energy we do use. “We limit our electrical items to the core few that are essential to our business, and when buying new we only go for efficient models. “Whenever something's not in use, we turn it off at the wall - nothing is left on standby, ever.” It comes after a study of 500 SME owners found 23% already had, or requested, a smart meter installation in the last six months - to help them to better control their business’ energy costs. It also found high start-up costs, managing day-to-day overheads, long workdays, and lack of marketing know-how are the main obstacles when starting a business. A fifth of the small business owners by Smart Energy GB regularly work a 12-hour day – with a quarter admitting getting no holidays was the hardest thing about their first year of trading. Nearly three in 10 are also taking much more notice of their energy consumption throughout the day, while a quarter have looked into using cheaper, greener energy sources and smart devices. Victoria Bacon from Smart Energy GB said: “When you’re focussing on trying to keep a business running smoothly, anything that helps make the day-to-day challenges a bit easier can be a welcome relief. “Smart meters send accurate energy readings direct to your supplier so you don’t have to, freeing up more of your time to focus on other areas of your business."" The research also found 43% of those polled have cut down on their overheads by encouraging staff to work from home more. Another 45% used any potential downtime to try and amp up their social media presence, to help drum up business. Encouragingly, more than four in 10 have managed to grow over a turbulent two years by pivoting their business and embracing new ways of generating revenue. But 46% believe they are still a few years away from accomplishing their business goals. The top goal for 35% over the next year is simply to bring in more money, followed by updating the company website (29%) generating returning customers (27%). Only one in four say their top goal in the next 12 months is to actually reduce their working hours, according to the OnePoll.com results. Victoria Bacon added: “Despite the disruption many businesses have faced over the last two years, nearly half were able to grow by making changes in direction. “But there are also simple things that businesses can do to help deal with a changing world, that don’t require major adjustments.""

Study reveals people are too frightened to become their own boss,"MORE than half of people say they admire how hard-working small business owners are – but a quarter don’t want the stress of becoming their own boss. A poll of 2,000 adults revealed 23% are too frightened of failure to take the plunge and start their own enterprise. The top traits deemed essential for a start-up owner to be successful are being hard working (53%), motivated (48%) and organised (46%). And 35% believe being willing to take risks is key for running your own business. It emerged 31% would consider providing financial support to a friend or family member who had an idea for a new business.   But 31% fear the lack of security and stability if they were to set up their own business, while 11% wouldn’t want others relying on them. On the plus side, however, four in 10% love the idea of being able to work on something they are passionate about. Claudio Gienal, CEO at AXA UK and Ireland, which commissioned the research, said: “Launching your own business is a huge decision, one that requires courage, self-belief, and drive. ""Despite the challenges that face small businesses, the majority of those who have done it believe it’s one of the best decisions they've ever made.    “While there are many perceived barriers to going out on your own, the rewards speak for themselves.” Further research of 500 small business owners in the UK (with under nine employees), commissioned by AXA UK for their Startup Report, found more than a fifth have borrowed cash from a family member to help support the business. But in terms of emotional support, 44% rely mostly on their partner, while 19% find other entrepreneurs are the people who truly understand them. Alan Sugar was named the entrepreneur most British small business magnates would most like to emulate in terms of success, according to the OnePoll figures. He was shortly followed by the world’s richest man, Elon Musk – and then current vice chairman of West Ham, Karren Brady. And the top advice small business owners would give others looking to follow in their footsteps would be to simply believe in themselves – and to learn from their mistakes. It comes as AXA UK this week launches their Startup Angels competition, which is giving six businesses the chance to win £25,000, 12 months business insurance and mentorship from some of Britain’s best entrepreneurs. Claudio Gienal added: “At AXA UK, we recognise the all-consuming nature of going it alone but with the right support, advice and protection, the opportunities are endless.” Visit the website here for more advice from UK business owners on start ups.

Small business owners want to go greener – but they don’t know how,"Eight in 10 small business owners want to be greener - but don’t know where to start. A study of 500 UK SME owners found despite 91% believing it’s important to be sustainable, they struggle due to a lack of guidance (42%), efficient carbon footprint data (37%) and time (37%). While 83% think the government needs to do more to educate and support businesses in their sustainability efforts. Despite this, 67% currently have a strategy in place for their enterprise, although 56% are reluctant to introduce a policy because they feel it’s too late to reverse climate change. And a confident 84% feel their company is as environmentally friendly as it claims to be. Some of the top ways businesses are trying to be more sustainable include recycling waste (36%), using energy-efficient appliances (26%) and environmentally friendly cleaning products (26%). The research, commissioned by the UK’s leading climate action brand Ecologi, found many are also going paperless (27%) and investing in smart plugs (20%).  But three quarters feel overwhelmed about how their organisation can tackle climate change and seven in 10 don’t fully understand the terminology used such as ‘net-zero’. Elliot Coad, CEO and co-founder of Ecologi said: “It’s promising to see how many businesses are already trying to make sustainable changes, but concerning that so many are still confused and some even believe it’s too late to make a difference. “We aim to help businesses and individuals understand the steps they can take to become climate positive and enable them to tackle sustainability in a simple and accessible way through a monthly subscription. “With collective action, the smallest of changes can have a big impact.” To help SMEs find out if they've got what it takes to run an eco-friendly business, Ecologi has created a quiz highlighting different environmental scenarios to reveal how they would suffice. The study also found a third are planning to make changes to improve the sustainability of their business as soon as within the next six months. Almost three quarters (72%) of owners believe such initiatives are worthwhile and 85% said it’s important for their company to be considered sustainable. And 61% even market and advertise their environmental credentials. But three in 10 still admit their business ought to be more sustainable than it currently is, with 24% blaming the pandemic for getting in the way of their short-term plans. A further fifth (22%) feel their plans have been hit by supply chain issues and recent energy and fuel price rises are also causing 63% to be concerned. SME owners predict 26% of their turnover is spent on green initiatives and 33% believing they personally drive the change in their company. But they’re not doing it alone, with 22% of businesses having a dedicated chief sustainability officer and eight in 10 admitted younger employees place more value on such measures. In comparison to their personal lives, 24% of those polled via OnePoll admitted they are more sustainable at home than in work – where they have installed solar panels (40%) and changed to a renewable energy supplier (28%).

The age at which kids become more tech savvy than their parents revealed,"KIDS become more tech savvy than their parents by the age of 12, a study found. More than seven in ten parents say children use terms they don’t understand. Digital safety topped the poll of skills where parents feel most ill-equipped to help their children, according to the research by Vodafone. Nicki Lyons, of Vodafone, said: “When it comes to tech any parent or carer knows what it’s like to feel your kids know more than you.” Almost half of parents and carers (47 per cent) feel their children know more than them when it comes to technology. In fact, a new study found Brits believe their kids' digital knowledge overtakes theirs at just 12-years-old. More than seven in 10 parents (71 per cent) claim their children use technological terms they don't understand - with 66 per cent of parents confessing they are unfamiliar with digital slang such as 'GRWM' (get ready with me) and 'OOMF' (one of my friends). Other online terms parents couldn't explain were 'smishing' (SMS-phishing), 'NFT' (non-fungible token) and 'Digital Activism'.

Urgent warning to parents over ‘dangerous’ YouTube shows for kids – here’s how to keep them safe,"AN urgent warning has been issued to parents over YouTube shows which could be ""dangerous"" for kids. As more youngsters tune into the streaming site normal channels have taken a hit. An Ofcom report revealed viewers aged between four and 15 only watched 25 minutes of broadcast TV per day in 2021. Whereas the decade before saw around 69 minutes watched daily.  Faraz Osman, the chairman of Bafta’s children’s advisory committee, said he fears the ""endless content"" available on the platform can change kids' viewing habits. He said parents have been left feeling overwhelmed by the ""addictive"" programming - which doesn't seem to end. Faraz told The Times: ""It seems that platforms now reward children’s content that is addictive rather than substantive, silly without being smart and shiny rather than safe. ""We risk leaving our kids unsupervised as they feed themselves low-quality, unhealthy, addictive and at times dangerous content.” The rise in YouTube shows comes after the funding for children's programmes dropped by over £100 million in the last 20 years.  Data shows £69 million was spent in 2021 compared to £195 million in 2002. Oli Hyatt, managing director of the firm behind CBeebies’ Alphablocks, said the decline in how much is spent on the industry needs to stop. He said cuts have meant kids are getting stuck in algorithms and watching shows which don't have benefits. It comes after parents were urgently warned that their children can access porn and be exposed to fake health advice on TikTok. Although thousands of Brits spend their evenings scrolling on the app, it can be potentially life-threatening in the wrong hands. An investigation by the Sunday Telegraph uncovered videos accessible by kids that contain links to porn, self-harm, and dangerous health advice. These include tips on how to lose 5kg in a week as content creators disguise what is essentially starvation as ""detox cleanses"". One viral trend even included swallowing pills that allegedly expelled any parasites in your body - but it is ""utter nonsense"" according to experts.

Chrome is introducing a brand new safety trick that could save you from embarrassment,"GOOGLE is making it possible to quickly clear all your recent browsing data with a new button that's sure to be handy. Maybe you've got a present you wish to keep a surprise. Or you could have searched for something embarrassing. Usually, you'd go to Incognito mode, Chrome's useful extra web browser which doesn't store as much data. But if you forget, or simply realise you've been on something you'd rather keep private, you have to go through history to get rid of it. It's a bit long, deleting only the recent data and nothing else. So what if you had a button that only deleted everything from the last 15 minutes? That's apparently what Google is working on now. According to Chrome Story, the new Quick Delete option comes in the form of a flag in the three dot menu. It's not clear when the feature will land on everyone's Chrome browser just yet. But when it does, the two taps will definitely make life a lot easier. Google has previously toyed with the idea on Android. So it now looks like it could be coming more widely very soon. We'll have to keep an eye out in future updates to see whether it comes true. For now, keep using Incognito for those private moments. Or delete the history the long way. To delete web history on Chrome, start by opening the three-dot menu in the top right. Find History, then History again. Go to Clear Browsing Data and select how far back you want to go and the types of data you'd like to purge. Looking for tips and hacks for your phone?

Brand new iPhone 16 ‘Ultra’ rumoured for next year – and it could cost an eye-watering amount,"APPLE is reportedly creating a sparkly iPhone 16 'Ultra' which is expected to win over tech fans despite a new lofty price. The intriguing 'Ultra' model comes amid plans to make the difference between its Pro and Pro Max models more obvious, according to Bloomberg.  Instead of renaming the 16th lineup's Pro Max model the 'Ultra', Apple could add a higher-end iPhone above both Pro models.  The tech company has reportedly discussed doing just that.  There are rumours it could even be introduced in the 2024 iPhone release. But the addition would drive up prices to heights never seen before.  The cost of a top-of-the-line model has risen from $1,150 in 2017 to $1,600 in the 14th lineup.  While a wider economic downturn seems a bizarre time to hike costs, Apple's boss Tim Cook thinks consumers are willing to pay extra.  Consumers would then, at least, have a reason to upgrade as concerns that the difference between models is becoming less distinct.  “I think people are willing to really stretch to get the best they can afford in that category,” Cook said on a recent earnings call.  This is because iPhones have become “integral” to people’s lives, he added, with most using it as their camera, debit card and health tracker.   Apple is expected to do more to differentiate product tiers in the iPhone 15 lineup arriving later this year.  This includes giving the Pro Max model a periscope lens, which will offer improved optical zoom.  Looking for tips and hacks for your phone?

Space experts find world just like Earth that we could live on – and it’s not too far away,"SCIENTISTS have uncovered an Earth-like planet which could be habitable for humans - or even host extraterrestrial life.  The exoplanet, known as Wolf 1069 b, orbits a red dwarf star just 31 light-years from Earth. It rests on the northside of our galaxy, the Milky Way.  It is the sixth closest Earth-like planet. And it is a particularly rare find.  Astronomers have discovered more than 5,200 exoplanets in the universe, but less than 200 of them are rocky and mountainous like Earth.   And just a dozen of them have the possibility of having liquid water on their surface - which is critical to sustaining life on our world.  A group of 50 astronomers from across the globe have confirmed the existence of the exoplanet, which they believe could be a rocky world.   Wolf 1069 b is around double the size of Earth, orbiting a red dwarf star in the Cygnus constellation.  The exoplanet is in its star's habitable zone, which means it could also be a rocky water world - much like our home planet. ""When we analysed the data of the star Wolf 1069, we discovered a clear, low-amplitude signal of what appears to be a planet of roughly Earth mass,"" Diana Kossakowski, an astronomer and lead author on the new research, said.  ""It orbits the star within 15.6 days at a distance equivalent to one-15th of the separation between the Earth and the Sun.""  It sits much closer the Sun than Earth, however.  But unlike Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun where temperatures can reach as high as 430 degrees Celsius - Wolf 1069 b is thought to have a much more habitable surface temperature.   The planet receives just 65% of the incident radiant power of what the Earth gets from the Sun.  Wolf 1069 also emits much less radiation, scientists found.  Astronomers think that if Wolf 1069 had an Earth-like atmosphere, temperatures could rise as high as 13 degrees Celcius.  This would keep water liquid on the side of the planet which faces the star.   An Earth-like atmosphere would also protect against high-energy electromagnetic radiation.  While Wolf 1069 is a promising candidate for life beyond Earth, or even a plan B for humans, there is a major catch.  Astronomers reckon they'll have to wait another decade before technology is advanced enough to search for signs of life on the planet.  And red dwarf stars are notorious for scarring nearby planets with massive stellar winds and UV radiation - similar to what the Sun did to Mars. Looking for tips and hacks for your phone?

Urgent warning to millions of iPhone users over problem with life-saving feature,"A LIFE-SAVING tool on Apple's latest iPhone is inadvertently causing trouble once again. Brand new Crash Detection on the latest iPhone and Apple Watch is designed to alert the police if a car accident is detected. It uses special sensors that detect the types of jolts one would expect from a collision. The device will give you 10 seconds to dismiss the alert with a loud, vibrating countdown, otherwise it assumes you're unresponsive and calls for help. While the option has been credited with saving lives, it's also had some teething issues. Last year we heard how people on rollercoasters were unintentionally setting the feature off. And now there are reporters skiers are at it too. According to The New York Times, dispatchers have been ""inundated"" with false calls. Colorado's Summit County, which is home to a number of ski resorts, is one area where authorities have noticed it causing a problem. Between January 13 and January 22 they had 185 false calls come up. ""My whole day is managing crash notifications,"" said Trina Dummer, interim director of Summit County'’s emergency services. Of course, the biggest concern is that it wastes critical time and resources of emergency services. Apple responded to the report, saying it's ""aware that in some specific scenarios these features have triggered emergency services when a user didn't experience a severe car crash or hard fall."" Four Apple reps are understood to have visited the Summit County call center to see how the response team works. Looking for tips and hacks for your phone?

What causes earthquakes and how is magnitude measured?,"EARTHQUAKES are known to be one of the world's most terrifying and destructive natural disasters. But how do earthquakes occur, and when have been the strongest ones recorded? The earth's crust is made up of different pieces known as tectonic plates. These plates fit together like a jigsaw and continuously move at a rate of a few centimetres a year, in different directions and at different speeds. It's common for plates to slides past each other, bump into each other and move away from each other. As plates carry on moving in different directions over long periods of time, friction causes energy to build up.  Eventually it becomes so great that the energy is released, which creates a shock wave - an earthquake.  If the earthquake is beneath the ocean it can create a series of huge waves, called a tsunami. Earthquakes occur around the world everyday with some so small, they can only be detected using specialist equipment. Others can be powerful enough to damage and destroy towns and cities. The size of such earthquakes would be measured on the Richter magnitude scale. There are earthquakes in the UK, but they are rare and so small that most people do not feel them. Magnitude is the most common measurement for the strength of an earthquake. Typically magnitude will be recorded by measuring the amplitude of seismic waves that are recorded on a seismometer. Seismometers are instruments that respond to noises and shaking in the ground. A magnitude readout is typically represented by a small number. What's interesting about magnitude is that it climbs on a logarithmic base-10 scale. So each time the number increases by one, the amplitude is actually 10 times greater. That means that a magnitude 4 earthquake isn't twice as strong as a magnitude 2 quake, but 100 times. The strongest quake on record peaked at around 9.4 to 9.6 magnitude. Also known as the Great Chilean earthquake, the Valdivia Earthquake was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded measuring 9.5 on the Richter scale. The earthquake hit on May 22, at 19:11 GMT (15:11 local time), approximately 100 miles off the coast of Chile - parallel to the city of Valdivia.  It lasted approximately 10 minutes and triggered a massive tsunami with waves up to 25m. The total number of fatalities from the earthquake and subsequent tsunamis have been estimated between 1,000 - 6,000, with about 3,000 people injured. Earthquakes by magnitude: The CDC has lots of advice for what to do in an earthquake. The official advice is to Drop. Cover. Hold On: The CDC recommends that you stay inside if you're already indoors. And it says that you shouldn't stand in a doorway. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/16519354/earthquake-causes-magnitude/
Inside Interpol’s secret virtual HQ as police plan to hunt criminals in the metaverse,"INTERPOL police officers could soon be roaming around the metaverse on the hunt for cyber criminals. The global agency is figuring out how to approach the brand new virtual world so officers are not left behind. Experts have already warned the metaverse is a money laundering crime scene and believe it'll become more rampant, complex and profitable. The metaverse is an endless 3D virtual space where people could eventually work, socialise and play. This could be with VR headsets but also via your smartphone or PC. It's been spearheaded by Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg as the future of communication. And police chiefs are all too aware that crooks love to hop onto trends quickly. ""Criminals are sophisticated and professional in very quickly adapting to any new technological tool that is available to commit crime,"" Interpol secretary general Jurgen Stock told BBC News. ""We need to sufficiently respond to that. ""Sometimes lawmakers, police, and our societies are running a little bit behind. ""We have seen if we are doing it too late, it already impacts trust in the tools we are using, and therefore the metaverse.  ""In similar platforms that already exist, criminals are using it."" Interpol has already launched its very own metaverse space. The secret area can only be accessed by police for training and virtual meetings. One problem decision makers have to contend with is what actually constitutes a crime in the metaverse. ""There are crimes where I don't know whether it can still be called a crime or not,"" Dr Madan Oberoi, Interpol's executive director of technology and innovation explained. ""For example, there have been reported cases of sexual harassment. ""If you look at the definitions of these crimes in physical space, and you try to apply it in the metaverse, there is a difficulty. ""We don't know whether we can call them a crime or not, but those threats are definitely there, so those issues are yet to be resolved."" Looking for tips and hacks for your phone?

People spot eerie ‘UFO’ hovering in the sky – but there’s a simple explanation,"A STRANGE arch that looks like a UFO has been spotted over the skies of south London. A shocked walker noticed an odd wavy object circling up above. It was seen in the morning time from a school field in Croydon. And space nerds have all sorts of theories about what it might be. Commenters on Reddit joked that it could be a Chinese spy balloon. It comes after the US shot down a real one accused of spying on key military sites. ""After Chinese balloon in USA, we got Chinese boomerang in UK, though not sure if there is anything worth spying on in Croydon?"" one said. Another dubbed it the ""Chinese Spy Arch"". A third person believes it could be a ""drone uprising"". One person suggested a more plausible theory - that it could be something called a horseshoe vortex cloud. The horseshoe vortex cloud is a rare pheonomeon that happens when the cloud forms in area of rotating air. While it's not entirely clear what the strange shape is, many believe it's probably just birds flying together. ""Murmuration of starlings or another kind of bird?"" someone commented. ""Though not really the time of year for it."" The person who posted the video said: ""At the time it didn’t look like birds. ""More like smoke or a cloud.""

Millions of Android phone owners issued urgent warning over 12 dangerous apps – delete them now,"GOOGLE has just deleted a raft of apps from its Play Store after cyber experts rang alarm bells that they were cheating users. The apps were described as 'ad junkies', meaning they are chock full of adverts to make developers money with little pay-off for users. The activity-tracking and gaming apps had millions of downloads.  But they would trick users into watching endless adverts or try to steal sensitive data through phishing attacks Some of the apps promise cash for watching adverts. But consumers would find they were duped into watching a never-ending reel of adverts with nothing in return.  Three apps using the same tactic are: Lucky Step – Walking Tracker, WalkingJoy and Lucky Habit: health tracker.  The trio of apps currently have around 20million downloads. All three connect with the same command and control server, according to experts at software company Dr.Web. These types of servers are typically used by cyber attackers to send directions to systems infected by malware.  ""They were then offered several dozen more ads to watch in order to 'speed up' the withdrawal process,"" experts at Dr.Web said when they raised concerns last month. ""With that, the apps did not verify any of the payment-related data provided by users, so the chances of receiving any of the money promised from these apps are extremely small."" These apps have also been removed:  While 11 of the apps have been removed from Google's Play Store, Android users have been advised to delete them from their devices.  Experts have also warned that Lucky Habit is still available on the Play Store.  Looking for tips and hacks for your phone? Want to find those secret features within social media apps?

Five jobs at risk of vanishing with ‘humans replaced by AI bots’ – could your profession be at risk?,"ARTIFICAL intelligence bots are sparking fears that millions of Brits could lose their jobs in the near future. Experts think ChatGPT - a new artificial intelligence system that can create human-like text - could replace humans in several professions. You can feed it a prompt, and it will create a chunk of text that continues on. If it works correctly, it will read in natural language as though it was written by a human. And it can even hold conversations, learning from things that you've said. The mind-blowing app can talk to you like a human, write poems, give you baking advice, solve complicated puzzles and so much more. Some companies, including creative agency IZSRI have already started to use AI to automate writing tasks. And its creative director and AI lead Zak Saidi, believes more and more humans will be replaced by artificial intelligence in the next three years. Here are the jobs he believes will be first to go…. Mr Saidi believes people who produce online copy could be first to get the axe. He told Mail Online: “We work with a lot of copywriters and there is certainly a lot of industry talk around the replacement of content writers by AI technology. “ChatGPT is free, copywriters aren't – we expect more tech-savvy small businesses to turn to ChatGPT and its AI counterparts when generating more content.” Mr Saidi believes the retail sector will be hit with “serious job losses” because of AI. He explained: “As we've seen, checkout staff, customer service assistants and personal shoppers are slowly being replaced by AI bots – powered by the exact same kind of artificial learning technology that ChatGPT works off.” ChatGPT can also write computer code in languages such as Python - meaning software engineers' jobs could be at risk. Mr Saidi said: “ChatGPT generates lines of html code without having to think, solving complex errors in sequence of code infinitely faster than a human. “This, to a certain extent, is throwing the role of supporting software engineers into question. “Whilst you still do need a human to plan out a software development project, ChatGPT can act as a crucial tool to resolve broken code and build basic applications – a role that would have been previously reserved for junior software engineers.” Mr Saidi explained that AI can also generate images. But graphic designers may look to artificial intelligence for inspiration, rather than as a replacement for their independently designed work.

Urgent warning to delete TikTok off your phone NOW over fears of ‘hostile’ Chinese threats,"CHINA is using TikTok to spy on us and Brits should delete the app now, a Tory MP has warned. Alicia Kearns said millions of people were being ""naïve"" about the popular social media video app which could be sending details back to China. She told Sky that she'd seen evidence that people working in China for the social media firm had allegedly hacked into European data and track down journalists' sources. And the Chinese-owned app is giving the rogue nation information about us that could be useful - including interests, regular locations or friendships. The Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee urged Brits to delete the app ""without question"" or be put at risk too. She told Sky's Sophie Ridge: ""Get off it, don't be naïve"" and insisted she did not have it on her own phone either. She added: ""It is not worth having that vulnerability on your phone and it is the ultimate data source for anyone with hostile efforts. ""The fact is now this isn’t just me saying I’m worried, delete it, we have evidence that Tik Tok has been used to track down sources for journalists.  ""Everyone should be concerned about that. ""China is building a tech totalitarian state on the back of our data so we have to get far more serious about protecting ourselves.  ""There is a reason why China have this app, there’s a reason why they are buying up gay dating apps – our data is a key vulnerability."" It comes after the US shot down a Chinese spy-balloon over America yesterday. The surveillance aircraft was dramatically shot down by two F-22 fighter jets off of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina yesterday afternoon. Crowds were seen cheering after the balloon plummeted into the ocean, where its wreckage is being gathered by divers and other military personnel. And Business Secretary Grant Shapps said Britain would have done the same if it had happened here. He said this morning: ""we fully support the US and the action they've taken. ""It cannot be right to send spy balloons floating over mainland of the United States and the UK would always take its national security very seriously."" A TikTok spokesperson said: ""TikTok is enjoyed by millions of people across the UK, and we want to be clear that they can trust us with their data.  ""We're taking steps like storing UK user data in our data centre operations in Ireland, starting this year; further reducing employee access to data; and minimising data flows outside of Europe.  ""We have written to Ms. Kearns on a number of occasions to ensure she has all the facts and information available and we look forward to having constructive engagement with her on these important issues in the near future.""

The tunes may be good but AI bots are laundering music,"WE have known that artificial intelligence (AI) would leave no industry unscathed – but it is on the brink of completely overhauling the music industry. The success of Google’s music-making AI has posed some pretty serious questions around the future need for human musicians and their rights - when robots make such good music. The UK government this week announced that it is planning to scrap the introduction of a copyright exception for text and mining purposes – which includes AI. Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, chief executive of UK Music, an industry body representing artists and record labels, said the law would have ""paved the way for music laundering"" and exposed creators and rights holders to exploitation. “We are delighted to see the back of a policy that risked irreparable damage to the global success story that is the UK music industry,"" he continued.  The plan, floated as an idea last summer, would have allowed AI developers to use copyright protected works without the permission of creators. In a Commons debate in Westminster on Wednesday, Britain’s science minister George Freeman said that AI is pushing forward “at a pace that in government we haven’t had to deal with before”. MP Sarah Olney, who brought the topic to Commons, said when she applied for the debate, no one had heard of ChatGPT - the popular AI bot that is now writing speeches for the chancellor. It seems like each week a new AI tool is launched, she added, which carries “significant risk”. “AI is rapidly permeating the creative sector, creating visual art, prose, music and film at a pace and cost that humans are unable to match,” she continued. “For creatives, the risk of AI-generated material flooding the market gives rise to significant regulatory and ethical challenges.” However, Pierre Barreau, CEO and co-founder of artificial composing tool AIVA told The Sun that the rise of creative AI could instead help “democratise” writing music. He explained that AI bots “are going to make it easier not only to create high quality music at scale for content creators, but also tell better stories by personalising that music to the content itself, and how consumers are engaging with that content”. AI can give musicians a wider array of tools, such as access to the sound of every instrument in the world.  “It's hard to think of more creativity in the world being anything but a net positive for humanity,"" he said.

Inside the wild world of AR and why it trounces VR,"MOVE over VR - AR is the one to watch. AR - or augmented reality - became big thanks to Pokemon Go. But only now is it really starting to get impressive. A TikToker recently revealed a video showing an augmented reality shop located on a beach. Just by holding his phone up, he could step into a virtual portal where you can explore products. ""So you can actually go into this portal and suddenly you're in the space, like full on immersive,"" AR expert Sunken Blimp said. ""Currently I'm walking on the beach and looking around and you can see the different furniture pieces and explore all of that. ""But when you look back, you know, that's the portal again for you to come out and walk back to the surface."" The demo gives a tiny glimpse of how we could shop in the not-so distant future. And it's not just shopping that's changing. Snapchat, which has been playing with AR for a while now, is launching a special augmented reality exhibition on London’s Regent Street with Vogue. Using the app, people can immerse themselves in the creative vision of some of the world’s most iconic designers, as they explore six custom designed rooms. It'll run for 16 days as part of London Fashion Week. EE has also got in on the act, bringing the film set to living rooms.

Fury as taxpayer foots £44k bill to create virtual reality sea creature to help calm stressed-out office staff,"TAXPAYERS are forking out £44,000 on a project to create a virtual reality sea creature for stressed-out office staff. The cash went to tech bosses who say their program is more calming than morphine. Government quango Innovate UK awarded the grant to London-based company Animorph to develop its Easel program. Its headset allows office workers to relax by immersing themselves in a simulated ocean floor setting where they can pet and feed a pretend sea creature. The company says: “Easel reduces stress by transporting the player to a distant, safe, under- water world where they can foster a caring relationship with an other-worldly sea creature.” “The player’s ability to move around freely and initiate rich interactions within the calming and audiovisually enchanting world provides a soothing sense of control. “The player uses gaze and hand gestures to navigate the ocean, and interacts with their sea-animal companion in a variety of ways, including feeding, playing, and cleaning up their environment. “VR has been documented as hugely beneficial, even surpassing the effectiveness of morphine for pain reduction.” A further £50,000 has been given to another London outfit, Awen Emotions, for a similar idea to help stressed students. The TaxPayers’ Alliance’s Conor Holohan said: “Taxpayers will ask why they’re funding this bizarre project. “With the long tentacles of the state taking ever more in tax, now more than ever precious funds should be used properly.

Inside Elon Musk’s space rescue pod that could help Nasa with critical emergencies,"A mini-rocket built by Elon Musk could be used to save astronauts in emergencies, Nasa has announced. The rescue pod, built by Musk's rocket company SpaceX, was the first private spacecraft to carry astronauts into orbit.  The Crew Dragon vehicle has an upper deck with four seats and a lower deck with three cargo pallets. It is currently docked to the International Space Station (ISS) but could be used to transport astronauts back to Earth in the event of an emergency. A coolant leak in a Russian Soyuz spacecraft docked to the ISS in December has left several astronauts stranded in the orbital hub.  The leak was ""fairly substantial"" according to a Nasa spokesperson at the time. Without its coolant, the Soyuz could overheat as it travelled back through Earth’s atmosphere.  Nasa and Russia's space agency Roscosmos worked together to come up with a plan to safely transport crew members home.  The plan they settled on was to use a replacement Soyuz craft that will be launched in February. Despite the saga, the astronauts are safe,  But the leaky Russian rocket raised concerns about how to evacuate ISS crew members in the case of an emergency. If astronauts needed to evacuate the ISS, they would usually do so in the vehicle that they arrived in.  But the coolant issue means that, for now at least, six astronauts are stuck on the station, including four Nasa and two Roscosmos crew members.  The current rescue plan is for Nasa astronaut Frank Rubio to travel in the SpaceX Crew Dragon along with Nasa's four Crew-5 members.  Although the Dragon capsule has just four seats, Sarah Walker, director, Dragon mission management at SpaceX, stressed that it would still be safe to carry an extra person.  “In the early days of laying out the Crew Dragon interior, we actually laid out the interior to accommodate up to seven individuals, and that was later adjusted to convert three of those seats to spaces that could be used as cargo storage,” she said. “Dragon has plenty of margin, even with the extra crew member, with respect to onboard life support."" Russian cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin will then travel in the Soyuz that experienced the leak. “What we wanted to do was reduce the heat load in the Soyuz, so by removing Rubio from the Soyuz you take away one third of the human heat load,” Joel Montalbano, manager of the International Space Station program at NASA, told reporters.   Looking for tips and hacks for your phone?

People are just noticing three Sky TV tricks everyone should try today,"MILLIONS of Sky TV customers might be missing out on some very handy features. We reveal three clever hacks that all TV fans should know about. If you hit Record on a Sky TV show, you'll get a series link. This means every episode in that TV series will be recorded – which isn't always ideal. Thankfully there's a way to stop that from happening: maybe you only want to record a single show? The way to do that is to tap Record again. This will allow you to convert the show to a Record Once setting. But that's not the only Recording trick worth knowing. You can also find all of your scheduled recordings in Recordings > Scheduled. This can give you a handy overview of what you've set to record. You can actually choose from three different quality settings for your on-demand downloads. These options include SD (Standard Definition), HD (High Definition), and UHD (Ultra High Definition). The latter is the best, and roughly equivalent to 4K. So choose that if you want the very best quality for your downloads. To do this, press Home on your Sky Q remote. Now go to Settings > Setup > Preferences. And then in On Demand Default Download Format, choose your quality. Your Sky TV has a hidden mode that all parents should know about. It's called Kids Safe Mode, and it can help to prevent your children from watching anything dodgy. The mode automatically blocks age-inappropriate content across the entire Sky ecosystem. And you can edit your parental controls to be extremely specific about what you want to allow or block. First you'll need to set up a PIN for your Sky Q box. A PIN can be really useful, as it'll let you protect rated shows and purchases. And it will also hide adult content by default. You can pick and choose any of the settings easily. Go to Home > Settings and then look for Parental. Now enter a PIN and select Family, which lets you edit your settings. You can PIN-protect specific shows based on their age rating in Ratings. And there's even an option to block access to various features and apps. That includes Online Video, YouTube and Vevo. Importantly, you can use your PIN to turn Kids Safe Mode on or off. Activating it is quick and easy, and will give you peace of mind. When you activate it, your Sky box will be strictly limited to TV shows and movies rated as suitable for children aged 12 and under. To turn Kids Safe Mode on or off, go to Home > Kids. Now go to Safe Mode and then enter your PIN to adjust the settings.  It's a great idea, especially if you have to be out of the living room for a while – or you're setting up Sky TV in a child's bedroom. Looking for tips and hacks for your phone?

"I wouldn’t give my daughter a smartphone until she was 11, says Samsung boss","A SAMSUNG boss refused to give his daughter a smartphone until she was 11. James Kitto, the head of the company’s mobile division in Britain and Ireland, said he wanted to keep her safe online. It comes days after research showed one in ten nine-year-olds had been exposed to adult content while using mobiles and computers. Mr Kitto told the BBC’s Today programme: “What is important here is that, whoever is using a smartphone, of whatever age, is safe when they are browsing the internet. “From my personal perspective, my daughter got a smartphone when she was 11. “Whatever age you make that choice for your child, it is important to ensure that, if they are accessing the internet, they are accessing it in a safe way.” Earlier this week, a survey for the Children’s Commissioner for England found by 11 a quarter of children had been exposed to porn and half had seen it by 13. Such exposure has been linked to low self-esteem among young people and harmful views of sex and relationships. All phone providers give free parental control services to limit what children can see on the internet, according to the telecoms regulator Ofcom.

Millions of Facebook users warned of critical error – it could cost you,"IF you like to sell your old stuff on Facebook Marketplace, watch out for a scam that's been going around. Fraudsters have been going around asking if they can arrange a collection via FedEx or UPS because they're apparently busy. ""OK I take it but I would like to come tomorrow but I am busy with work at the moment,"" the swindle usually begins. ""I'll send a UPS letter carrier to your home to give you your money in cash and collect the item."" First of all, delivery firms like Fedex and UPS don't offer services like this. But the scam gets trickier when they ask you to pay for insurance of the envelope supposedly carrying your cash. They claim that this is a requirement from the deliver provider and promise to leave the additional amount in the envelope so you're not out of pocket. To lure victims in further, the fraudster will ask for your email address. They'll use this to send you a fake email pretending to be from the delivery company where you need to deposit the insurance money. It'll include things like a fake tracking number to make it seem authentic. If you go ahead, you'll end up paying the scammer and no such delivery service will ever arrive. And should you get suspicious and refuse, things can turn nasty. The bad actor may start off with the sympathy card, saying they'll lose money because the delivery order can't be cancelled. This can even lead to threats if you keep refusing. The scam has actually been going on for a while now but Facebook Marketplace sellers say it's still happening. It's always best to meet in person when buying or selling on Facebook Marketplace. Ensure it's a public meeting spot that's in a well-lit area. Avoid payment links and log in directly through the payment method's website. Most sellers prefer to deal with cash directly when meeting to ensure it's legit. It's always a good idea to take a look at the person’s profile as this could have some tell-tale signs. Check the date the account was created. Facebook launched in the UK in 2005, so most people will have accounts that date a few years back. If the account contacting you was created very recently (in the past few weeks or months), you should approach with caution as this could show that it has specifically been created to scam innocent people.

WhatsApp has a brand new trick that will change group messages for the better,"WHATSAPP is making it a whole lot easier to keep important group messages where everyone can see them. The popular app is working on yet another new feature to take groups to a new level. According to a leaked screenshot, it looks like you will soon be able to pin messages for the first time. It's a small but potentially significant change for anyone participating in groups on WhatsApp. For example, details of an important family event could be pinned up top for all to see in a group with your relatives. Or it could be used in a work group for colleagues so they're aware of specific details. WABetaInfo uncovered an early look of the option. ""Thanks to pinned messages, we can make them easily accessible to everyone in the conversation and people stay always focused on what is really important,"" the site says. ""The ability to pin messages within chats and groups is under development and it will be released in a future update of the app."" As ever with beta testing, it's very early days and WhatsApp bosses may decide not to roll it out to the wider public. If you're very impatient, signing up to the WhatsApp beta is an easy way to get features first. Follow our guide below to find out how. To download WhatsApp beta for your smartphone you need to go to Google Play on your Android and search for WhatsApp. Scroll down the page until you see ""Become a Beta Tester"". Tap the ""I'm In"" button and then click ""Join"" to confirm. Now all you have to do is wait for the update to the beta version of the app. Joining the WhatsApp beta on iOS is more difficult, and has limited capacity. Follow Apple’s guide here.

You’re in the top 1% if you can spot hidden animal within 10 seconds,"ILLUSION fans have been left scratching their heads trying to spot a hidden animal. One glance and you'd be forgiven for thinking it's just bark on a tree. But a certain reptile is very much there hiding in plain sight. The brainteaser was revealed on TikTok by Kyhber. He says only one per cent of people can actually see the creature. Can you do it in 10 seconds? If you can't spot it, here's a clue, it's a snake. If you're still struggling to find it, look towards the middle. The snake is vertical, with its head facing up. We've put a red box around it in the image further down.  Judging by the comments, most people managed to spot the creature eventually. There are all sorts of optical illusions around on the web that really test your eyes. Users recently struggled to spot a leopard perfectly camouflaged on rocky mountain terrain. The mind-boggling optical illusion was taken high in the Himalayas in north-eastern India.

Old iPhone set to sell for eye-watering price at auction – could you be sitting on a small fortune?,"AN OLD iPhone is expected to fetch an eyewatering $50,000 at a US auction. The ancient Apple device had previously been gathering dust on a shelf for 16 years.  The old phone has a two megapixel camera and 8GB of storage. The first-generation iPhone was gifted to a Karen Green in 2007 when she got a new job. But Green had recently got a new phone at the time.  So, instead, she put the device away for more than a decade.  The old phone is being auctioned off at LCG Auctions, which opens on Thursday and will end on 19 February. Green, a cosmetic tattoo artist, contacted LCG Auctions when she heard of a first generation iPhone snagging a similar figure in October.  A first-generation iPhone sold for a whopping $39,339 late last year, which piqued Green's interest.   LCG Auctions has now had an influx of old iPhone owners looking for a small fortune.  “We got calls from everybody but 99% of them didn’t have the same thing,” LCG Auctions founder, Mark Montero, told Business Insider.  “But Karen had a really unique piece with a great story behind it. “It was shocking because we had gotten so many duds.” LCG Auctions put a price estimate of “$50,000 and up” on the phone.

iPhone hack to spy through walls and hear any conversation revealed,"BEWARE if someone has left their iPhone in the room as they could be using it to spy on you. All the snooper needs is Bluetooth headphones such as AirPods and they can literally hear any private conversation through walls. The hack was revealed on TikTok by user Dalilamouhib who said she was ""shocked"" how it could be used to sneakily listen in on partners and friends. ""You can hear everything, everything through your AirPods,"" she tells her 99.7k followers. ""You leave your phone in a room, go to another room and you can hear what people talking in the room that your phone is in, loud and clear. ""And they don't know about it."" The dodgy move is done by misusing the hard of hearing feature on the iPhone. It is found within the Control Centre, where you tap the plus sign next to Hearing. All a person has to do then is slide down to open the control centre and select the hearing icon. From there, turn Live Listen on and they can leave the phone in a room and hear everything the phone hears through their headphones. Of course, spying on people is not encouraged. It will only work as far as the Bluetooth connection will allow, but could still be used from several rooms away, even with doors closed. If you think someone is trying it on, an orange microphone icon will be displayed on the top left of the iPhone screen. Dalilamouhib's video has been liked by more than 3million people. ""Despite the many other obvious ‘uses’ it may have, the feature is designed to assist those hard of hearing so that they can place their phone near a noise source and hear it even from far away, say for a lecture at university for example,"" said Tom Peet from the Repair Outlet.

Baby boy chokes to death at nursery as heartbroken parents pay tribute to ‘perfect’ tot,"A HEARTBROKEN couple have paid tribute to their ""perfect"" baby boy after her choked to death at a nursery. Zoey and Lewis Steeper said that their nine-month-old baby Oliver was ""the best baby you could ever have wished for"" and was ""just perfect"". Oliver died of a brain injury and heart attack, six days after choking on food at Jelly Beans Day Nursery in Ashford, Kent in September 2021. Tragic photos show him in his hospital bed on life support. His parents have now been told by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) that criminal charges will not be pursued against the nursery, which closed permanently after the horror. However, Zoey, 32, and Lewis, 37, have asked for that decision to be reviewed. They posted a statement to the Oliver Steeper Foundation website, saying: ""Whilst the initial investigation concluded that the nursery’s policies and procedures were ‘of poor quality and inconsistent’ no accountability for our son’s tragic and avoidable death will prevail at this moment in time. ""We are hugely disappointed and shocked at the initial decision, but we are far from deterred. ""We have now instructed specialist solicitors Leigh Day, who have lodged our appeal with the Crown Prosecution Service. ""We will leave no stone unturned as we feel that many key aspects of what happened on that day have been missed or ignored by the CPS."" They added that they were also disappointed by Ofsted's handling of the case. An inquest into the tragedy found Oliver's cause of death to be a brain injury and heart attack, but was adjourned pending the outcome of investigations. The couple, who have since had another child, say they are grateful for ""another chance"" at parenthood but remain determined in their campaign against relaxing teacher-child ratios in nurseries. Lewis said: ""After losing Oliver in an early years setting, we feel it's our duty now to protect other children from people who are trying to overhaul the sector. ""These are members of parliament who will never put their own children into a local nursery because of their wealth and privileges; who simply don't live in the real world the rest of us do and don't bat an eyelid at the cost of childcare."" A spokesperson for Kent Police said that following a ""thorough investigation"" no further action would be taken. The case has been filed and the force is preparing a report for the coroner. A spokesperson for the CPS said: ""After a careful review of all the evidence, we concluded that there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction for either suspect. ""Oliver’s death was a tragedy, and we understand how difficult it must have been for his family to hear our decision. Our thoughts remain with them at this difficult time."" On the request for a review from Oliver parents, they added: ""We will now conduct a further, full independent review of all the evidence. It would not be appropriate to comment further until the review has been completed."" ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21299454/baby-boy-chokes-nursery-heartbroken-parents/
Horror as mum is trampled to death by a herd of stampeding cows while walking her beloved dog,"A MUM was trampled to death by a herd of stampeding cows while walking her beloved dog. Kathy McKellar, 74, was found dead in a field near her rented holiday cottage in Grindle, Lancashire surrounded by 25 Limousin cows, as well as calves and bulls. The cottage's owner, John Towler, came across her cockapoo Archie, who had made his way back to the cottage, on September 25 2022. Unable to find Kathy, he called 999 and went out to look for her. The next morning, while checking his cattle, Mr Towler found her body in one of his field. Kathy was pronounced dead at the scene, with a post-mortem CT revealing that she died from traumatic chest injuries. Her son Andy told an inquest on February 6: ""She would go on this sort of holiday regularly, she did everything for herself, and she brought up my brother and I pretty much on her own ""She loved being outside and walking the dog; it was their happy place. ""We lost my Nan two years ago from old age so mum liked to come back up here to feel more connected to her part of the world. Although she was 74 she was still working part-time."" Mr Towler told the inquest that he has never had any issues with his cows or bulls being aggressive or being scared of dogs. However, the coroner heard that a woman had been injured in one of his fields in 2018 after disturbing sleeping cows. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21299348/horror-mum-trampled-stampeding-cows/
Nicola Bulley dive expert claims ‘gut feeling’ there could be third party involvement in disappearance,"A DIVE expert in the search for Nicola Bulley claims there could be a ""third party"" involvement in her disappearance. Peter Faulding said if his team cannot find the mum-of-two today, his ""gut"" feeling is there may be other reasons for her vanishing. The diver's claims centred around suspicion of her phone - found on a bench connected to a meeting - that he claims could be a ""decoy"". He told BBC Breakfast: “If Nicola is not in that stretch of river today my view is that there is a third party involved and this was a decoy placed by the river. “It could have been placed as a decoy there is not enough CCTV to cover particular areas here the police are working hard in the background to cover everything. “It’s so unusual we’ve got no clear information to go on."" He explained he had a similar incident in the search for missing Laura Torn in 2003 where a stiletto was placed to distract investigators. But Nicola's case has left him ""well and truly baffled"", the veteran diver of 25 years told TalkTV. Yesterday's search for Nicola, 45, focused downstream on the tidal area of the River Wyre in Lancashire but Tuesday's search will take place further upstream. The search area will include and go beyond the area where Nicola's belongings were found on a bench near Garstang Road, in St Michael's on Wyre. It is a non-tidal area of the river. Mr Faulding explained: ""If Nicola is in the river, she could have even fallen further up, we don't know. ""The key focus has been around the bench area, we have got to rule out everything here. ""We can't just go for the bench, we have got to cover the whole stretch of river to make sure there is no untoward circumstances here."" The mum, from nearby Inskip, disappeared after dropping her children off at school on Friday January 27. She was last seen around 9.15am that day. On Monday Lancashire Police released fresh CCTV images of Nicola from the day she disappeared. In a statement released the same day through cops, partner Paul Ansell said: ""I have two little girls who miss their mummy desperately and who need her back."" And a heart-breaking video of her kids looking at search helicopters heard Sophia, six, say: ""Them helicopters, they're looking for mummy."" Mr Faulding previously told Sky News that ""none of this rings right to me"" and that it was ""my belief is she’s not in the river at all"". He is leading a team from Specialist Group International (SGI), assisting divers from Lancashire Police. The team, from Dorking, Surrey, are forensic experts responsible for assisting cops across the south east with underwater search operations. Yesterday they deployed specialist equipment that scans the river bed and can ""see everything that is laying down there"", he said. They are using a “high-spec” £55,000 side-scan sonar that creates an image of large areas of sea floors and riverbeds. The diver said his team can cover areas ""extremely quickly"" adding that if Nicola is in the water they will ""find her in minutes"". Cops are confident, after reviewing CCTV, that Ms Bulley did not leave the field near the river via Rowanwater. This is the case for leaving either through the site itself or the piece of land at the side. And she did not return from the fields along Allotment Lane or via the path at the rear of the Grapes pub onto Garstang Road. The Sun Online has approached Lancashire Police for comment.

Rishi Sunak to hold Cabinet mini reshuffle TODAY after Nadhim Zahawi sacking,"RISHI Sunak is set to announce a sweeping shake-up of his Cabinet top table and Whitehall departments.  As revealed by The Sun last night, this afternoon the PM will finally reveal a new minister to take over from Nadhim Zahawi as Tory Chair.  And he's expected to confirm the break-up of the government's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). The news was first reported by The Sun in a major exclusive last night.  Trade Minister Greg Hands is tipped to replace Mr Zahawi, after the ex-Chancellor was found to have broken the ministerial code over his tax affairs. BEIS will be broken up into a stand­alone Energy department, with Business and Trade merged and a new Science and Digital unit. Culture and Sport would be left as a separate department, with major implications for the make-up of the Cabinet. Business Secretary Grant Shapps was being tipped by senior Tories to be party chairman, but others said he was likely to stay in a big ministerial job. Mr Sunak pledged to form a standalone Energy department when campaigning to be Tory leader in August last year.  No10 wants the UK to be energy independent by 2045 so Brits no longer have to rely on tyrants like Putin for gas and electricity. But a merging of Business and Trade would trigger speculation over the future of International Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch, a former leadership contender. One source said: “These changes will put a lot of noses out of joint. There will be winners and losers with some very upset egos. ""Where does Kemi fit in?” Another source said: “The focus is making government work better but in reality it leaves senior ministers looking over their shoulders. ""And it leaves a question over the future of Dominic Raab, who faces a bullying inquiry.” The Deputy PM, who is currently being investigated over multiple bullying allegations, is understood to be staying in his post. The PM wants to wait until the inquiry into his treatment of civil servants has concluded before potentially moving him.  A Ministry of Justice source said: “A reshuffle where Raab remains in post shows that Rishi either does not care about victims, or that he actively condones this behaviour.” Formal reshuffle announcement are set to begin in the next hour, with the PM hosting the first meeting of his new-look Cabinet this afternoon.

Britain’s ‘most notorious prisoner’ Charles Bronson could be FREED from jail in just months,"BRITAIN'S 'most notorious prisoner' Charles Bronson could be released from jail within months in a new bid for freedom. The parole board confirmed that Bronson, 70, will have a public hearing on March 6 and 8, which could lead to him leaving prison for the first time since 1992. He is the first inmate to formally request a public parole hearing under new rules. In a letter to George Bamby-Salvador, who claims to be the famous hardman's long lost son, Bronson, who now goes by the name Charles Salvador, revealed his desire to live out his days in a caravan in Devon. He is currently fundraising to be able to buy the mobile home and told his 'son': ""I'm coming home."" However, in a letter to a fan last year, he issued a series of chilling threats, including saying that he will ""go collecting"" what he's owed by ""parasites that have sucked off me for four decades"". The parole board said that their panel would ""carefully examine a huge range of evidence"" in assessing whether to release Bronson. Charles Bronson was born in 1952, with the Luton local quickly turning to gang fights in his youth. Armed robber Bronson has spent almost 50 years behind bars after repeatedly having his sentence increased for attacking prison staff and taking them hostage. He was first imprisoned in 1974. Writing in his 2000 book Bronson, he said: ""I'm a nice guy, but sometimes I lose all my senses and become nasty. ""That doesn't make me evil, just confused"". Bronson has changed his name a number of times, with his different titles defining certain periods in his life. Born Michael Gordon Peterson, he changed his name to Charles Bronson during a short stint of freedom  in 1987. He used his new persona to launch an illegal bare-knuckle fighting career, but returned to jail in 1988, keeping his new name. The criminal converted briefly to Islam in 2001 and became known as Charles Ali Ahmed after marrying Fatema Saira Rehman, a woman who had started to write to him during his time behind bars. In August 2014, Charles announced he was legally changing his name to Charles Salvador - a tribute to the artist Salvador Dali. He has married three times, his first marriage was in 1971 before his first arrest. In February 2022, it was revealed model Gemma Fernandez has reportedly struck up a friendship with the 70-year-old criminal and opened up about her visit to HMP Woodhill on her YouTube channel. Bronson was first sentenced to seven years in jail over an armed robbery in 1974 - which was extended by nine months after he attacked a fellow prisoner with a glass jug. He later attempted to strangle Gordon Robinson while at Broadmoor, before causing £250,000 worth of damage when he staged a three-day protest on a rooftop. The serial criminal was eventually released in 1987, where he changed his name to Charles Bronson on the advice of his bare-knuckle boxing promoter. But it was not long before he was back in jail, after robbing a jewellery shop in 1988 and sentenced to seven more years inside. Bronson was released early from his sentence in 1992 - but was back behind bars 53 days later for intent to commit robbery. After holding three men hostage in his cell, the Luton lad saw another seven years added to his sentence - although this was cut to five on appeal. Following further incidents, he was finally given a life sentence after kidnapping a prison teacher in 1999, causing destruction to the prison. After being held at a number of prisons across the country - including the likes of Broadmoor and Belmarsh - he returned to HM Prison Woodhill in 2018, where Bronson is currently incarcerated. In June 2020, a High Court ruled in his favour ruling for the right for his parole board meeting to be held in public in the name of a fair trial. Bronson turned to art after spending decades behind bars, even changing his name to Charles Salvador and starting an art foundation in that name. The fitness fanatic even auctioned a piece of artwork and donated the proceeds to a young boy with cerebral palsy, the Milton Keynes Citizen reported. His artwork has also been displayed on the Tube but was ultimately taken down. More than 100 pieces were sold in 2014 in an attempt to ""renounce violence"" that plagued his past. Bronson married Paula Williamson on November 14, 2017 - having previously wanted to tie the knot on her birthday in August. Former Corrie actress Paula was bundled into Wakefield jail under a purple cloak after a bizarre procession through the town led by a lookalike and a woman on a mobility scooter. Charles was handcuffed to a warder for the strictly controlled two-hour ceremony witnessed by just five guests. A reception was held at a local hotel, but Paula headed to Malta without her new husband as he was led back to his cell after the ceremony. Paula emerged from the prison under a ghostly white shroud on top of her purple cloak, ensuring her dress was almost completely hidden from view. She was then smuggled into the York House Hotel through a side door to continue the celebrations with friends and family - who had their phones confiscated as she reportedly sold picture rights to a newspaper. But it seemed there were problems in the marriage after just six months with Paula admitting their relationship was ""on the rocks"" after Bronson made a series of demands about her weight. Bronson reportedly instructed the actress to do 400 sit-ups a day after ordering her “don't get fat”. This came after she learned Bronson may have set his parole back after allegedly stripping off and smearing butter on himself before challenging guards to a scrap. Bronson was reported to be demanding a divorce following the publication of pictures showing Paula on a wild night out in Tenerife letting a lad bury his head in her boobs. Williamson was found dead on July 29, 2019 at a house in Sneyd Green, Staffs Police confirmed. Her death was not treated as suspicious by police.

Huge Nicola Bulley development as cops focus search on specific river path after analysing phone and Fitbit,"POLICE searching for Nicola Bulley are focusing efforts on a specific river path where the mum-of-two may have travelled. The track from the fields, where she was last seen, to Garstang Road in St Michaels on Wyre may hold vital clues. Lancashire Constabulary are now appealing to drivers and cyclists to come forward who may have footage from the morning of January 27 when Nicola vanished. In a statement, the force added: ""We have also spoken to numerous witnesses, analysed Nicola’s mobile phone and fitbit. ""And searched the derelict house on the other side of the river as well as any empty caravans in the vicinity. ""We have already done a lot of work around this. ""But every piece of footage helps us build up a picture of movements on that morning."" They will also be sending letters to travellers who they think may have been driving down Garstang Road that morning. Only drivers with dashcam footage are asked to email NicolaBulleyInvestigation@lancashire.police.uk to let police know. Nicola's pal Emma White said police had been working to get data off the missing mum's fitbit fitness watch. Speaking on Saturday, she told The Sun: “The Fitbit had not been synced since Tuesday. ""The police are trying other ways to try to get information from it.” Cops are confident, after reviewing CCTV, that Nicola did not leave the field near the river via Rowanwater. This is the case for leaving either through the site itself or the piece of land at the side. And she did not return from the fields along Allotment Lane or via the path at the rear of the Grapes pub onto Garstang Road. They continue to work on the hypothesis that the mortgage worker fell into the River Wyre. Until now, police say sightings of Nicola have been by witnesses who knew her. These have enabled cops to plot her movements from the school, along the river path and into the field. Peter Faulding, leader of Specialist Group International (SGI) who are scouring the river for the mum, now has a ""gut"" feeling a third party could be responsible. The diver told BBC Breakfast today: “If Nicola is not in that stretch of river today my view is that there is a third party involved and this was a decoy placed by the river. “It could have been placed as a decoy, there is not enough CCTV to cover particular areas here. The police are working hard in the background to cover everything. “It’s so unusual, we’ve got no clear information to go on."" Yesterday's search for Nicola, 45, focused downstream on the tidal area of the River Wyre in Lancashire but Tuesday's search will take place further upstream. The search area will include and go beyond the area where the mum's belongings were found on a bench near Garstang Road, in St Michael's on Wyre. The mum, from nearby Inskip, disappeared after dropping her children off at school on Friday January 27. She was last seen around 9.15am that day. On Monday Lancashire Police released fresh CCTV images of Nicola from the day she disappeared. In a statement released the same day through cops, partner Paul Ansell said: ""I have two little girls who miss their mummy desperately and who need her back."" And a heartbreaking video of her kids looking at search helicopters heard Sophia, six, say: ""Them helicopters, they're looking for mummy.""

Epsom College death updates — Tributes pour in as Emma Pattison ‘killed by husband’ in double murder-suicide cops claim,"TRIBUTES have poured in after Emma Pattison, the headmistress of Epsom College, was found dead on school grounds. Police investigating the deaths are understood to be treating the tragedy as a double murder and suicide as detectives suspect George Pattison, 39, killed his wife Emma, 45, and little Lettie. Emma Pattison, 45, became the headmistress of the £42,000 per-year private school in September of last year. Tributes have come in thick and fast, with Dr Alastair Wells, Chair of the Board of Governors at Epsom College, saying: “On behalf of everyone at Epsom College, I want to convey our utter shock and disbelief at this tragic news. ""Our immediate thoughts and condolences are with Emma’s family, friends and loved ones, and to the many pupils and colleagues whose lives she enriched throughout her distinguished career."" Chloe Rathbone, 27, a nursery worker who previously looked after Lettie, told The Times: “I knew Emma, George and Lettie and I am utterly heartbroken over this news. “They were such a lovely family and Lettie was perfect in every way.” Tributes have flooded in following the news of Emma Pattison's death.  One mourner said: ""As an OE who met Emma Pattison just 3 months ago, I am overwhelmed with sadness.  ""She was a joy to meet, and I was so looking forward to meeting her again on Founder's Day."" A second added: ""Every Head in the country and every school in the land will be keeping the Epsom community in their thoughts and prayers in the days and weeks to come.  ""Our love to you all as you process this news and keep watch over a devastated community."" One shaken former neighbour said: ""It is just shocking and unimaginable. ""She was very bubbly, she was out jogging a lot. ""He was quiet. All I know about him is that he was a financial guy. ""I got nothing more than a wave from him in four years, whereas Emma I often chatted to. ""She was more outgoing. I would see her out with the daughter, running and playing on the bike."" Police investigating the deaths of a headteacher, her husband and seven-year-old daughter are understood to be treating the tragedy as a double murder and suicide. Detectives suspect George Pattison, 39, killed his wife Emma, 45, and little Lettie before taking his own life last weekend. Surrey Police said they are not looking for anybody else in connection with the ""isolated"" incident, but have given no further details of the causes of the deaths. Dr Alastair Wells, Chair of the Board of Governors at Epsom College, wrote: “On behalf of everyone at Epsom College, I want to convey our utter shock and disbelief at this tragic news. ""Our immediate thoughts and condolences are with Emma’s family, friends and loved ones, and to the many pupils and colleagues whose lives she enriched throughout her distinguished career.  On Sunday, February 5, 2023, Detective Chief Inspector Kimball Edey said: “On behalf of Surrey Police, my team, and I, I first want to express my sincerest condolences to the friends and family of Emma, Lettie, and George, as well as to the students and staff of Epsom College, for their tragic loss.  “I want to give my assurance that we will conduct a thorough investigation into what took place last night, and hope to be able to bring some peace in these traumatic circumstances. I would ask that their privacy is respected at this very difficult time.” It costs £42,000 a year for students to attend Epsom College. Over 850 boys and girls attend the school, which was founded in 1855. Jeremy Vine brother Tim, as well as Nicholas Witchell are among the school’s alumni. Tributes have been flooding in following the tragic news. One tweeted: ""Every Head in the country and every school in the land will be keeping the Epsom community in their thoughts and prayers in the days and weeks to come."" A second said: ""This is tragic news and our hearts go out to the school communities of Epsom College and Croydon High. ""Emma was an inspiring leader and a fabulous role model, Those who knew her are better for having done so."" The Pattison family home is understood to be surrounded by other properties occupied by teachers and school workers. It is just yards from the college's indoor rifle range, which appeared to be cordoned off this morning. No live ammunition is kept on the premises, an insider claimed. Emma told sixth form students on the school podcast Epsom Insight: ""It has been a really big change for my family.  ""We've obviously moved house, we've bought a dog, I've got a new job, my husband's got a new job which wasn't meant to happen but did, and my daughter has started a new school. ""There has been a lot of change for us as a family, but it has been wonderful."" Paul Williams was appointed acting headteacher of Epsom College, following the sudden death of Emma Pattison on February 5, 2023. Williams will be responsible for the around 900 boy and girls who attend the college. The facility is an independent day and boarding school located on the Epsom Downs in Surrey. According to the college website, Williams has a Bachelor degree in science, which he achieved at Durham University. In a statement, Surrey Police confirmed how they discovered Emma Pattison and her family. “In the early hours of this [Sun] morning, Surrey Police was contacted by the South East Coast Ambulance Service to attend a property in the grounds of Epsom College. “Officers attended at around 01.10am where they, sadly, found the bodies of three people, including a child. “We can confirm that the bodies found were Emma Pattison aged 45 years, head of Epsom College, her daughter Lettie, aged seven years and her husband George aged 39 years. “The family’s next of kins have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers. “An investigation is being carried out to establish the circumstances of their deaths. At this stage, police are confident that this is an isolated incident with no third-party involvement.” The chief of Emma Pattison's previous school, Croydon High School, has paid tribute to the late teacher. Cheryl Giovannoni, chief executive at GDST which oversees Croydon High School, said: ""Emma was a much loved and respected member of the GDST community, as well as a talented Head and teacher and a dear friend to many of us. ""She touched the lives of all of us with her energy, wisdom and kindness during her six years as Head of Croydon High School and the school will always bear the legacy of her inspiring leadership. ""We are taking time to support staff and students at Croydon High School as well as everyone in the GDST family, and their wellbeing will be our priority in the coming days."" Little, so far, has come to light about Emma’s 39-year-old husband George. His body was found alongside Emma and her daughter Lettie in a property on the grounds of the college. Speaking on the Epsom College podcast, Emma Pattison shared her love for teaching. She said: “I get to talk to people, I get to work with young people and I think the moment when I thought about what my day to day life would be and the fact that it would be working with young people, it’s so much fun – they keep you young, they keep you happy, they keep you energised. “That was a turning point, I ditched the job I didn’t like very much went into teaching and literally haven’t looked back since.” Upon joining Epsom College as headmistress, Emma Pattison hailed the school's historic reputation. “I am delighted and honoured to have been appointed head of Epsom College,” Ms Pattinson said. “It is a school I have long admired, with an enviable reputation, and George and I can’t wait to meet the pupils, parents and staff and to become part of this wonderful community."" Surrey police have said they are confident the death of Emma Pattison, her husband and her daughter, was an isolated incident. A police statement read: “An investigation is being carried out to establish the circumstances of their deaths. ""At this stage, police are confident that this is an isolated incident with no third-party involvement.” Detective Chief Inspector Kimball Edey said: “On behalf of Surrey Police, my team, and I, I first want to express my sincerest condolences to the friends and family of Emma, Lettie and George, as well as to the students and staff of Epsom College, for their tragic loss.  “I want to give my assurance that we will conduct a thorough investigation into what took place last night, and hope to be able to bring some peace in these traumatic circumstances. “I would ask that their privacy is respected at this very difficult time.” While Inspector Jon Vale, Epsom and Ewell’s Borough Commander, added: “We’re aware that this tragic incident will have caused concern and upset in the local community. “While this is believed to be an isolated incident, in the coming days, our local officers will remain in the area to offer reassurance to students, parents, teachers, and the local community. “I would like to thank the school and the community for their understanding and patience while the investigation continues.” Speaking on the Epsom College podcast, Emma Pattison shared her love for teaching.

""There is so much to look ahead to and be excited about,"" she added. ""I'm not sure [I can pick one thing]. There is so much to come."" The only suggestion of any difficulty was that the move had put pressure on her family and she found it tricky to find time for herself. Emma Pattison, who was found dead alongside her husband and seven-year-old daughter, has been described as a “fresh and forward-thinking” teacher. An interview with School Management Plus last month, described her as “fresh and forward-thinking, a far cry from traditional perceptions of aloof elitism in the independent sector”. She finished the chat by declaring: “It could be time to shape a really exciting future.” Surrey police have said they are confident the death of Emma Pattison, her husband and her daughter, was an isolated incident. A police statement read: “An investigation is being carried out to establish the circumstances of their deaths. “At this stage, police are confident that this is an isolated incident with no third-party involvement.” Tributes have continued to pour in on social media for Emma and her family.  One said: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with your entire community at this most difficult time. God bless you all."" A second added: ""This is tragic news. Emma was such an inspiration during lockdown when she persuaded us to get together across the network to provide an innovative curriculum for Y13.  ""My thoughts are with you all, her family and friends."" The discovery in the early hours of Sunday morning has left the community shaken and heartbroken. The college is open as normal, but tearful pupils were this morning marshalled through the police-guarded gates and to class. They were to attend chapel services throughout the day and be offered counselling, a spokesperson said. Before Christmas, Emma Pattison excitedly told pupils how much she had loved her first few weeks at the helm of Epsom College, Surrey, and that ""there is so much to come"". The 45-year-old said on the school's podcast that she couldn't wait to experience her first Founder's Day, where students, parents, staff and alumni enjoy picnics and games. She also described the annual pancake race, prize-giving ceremony and regular fine-dining soirees as events to look forward to - and revealed she hoped to bring the school's houses and year groups together more often. But only two months later, the ""wonderful"" headmistress was found dead on-site along with her accountant husband George, 39, and seven-year-old daughter Lettie. The Pattison family home is understood to be surrounded by other properties occupied by teachers and school workers. It is just yards from the college's indoor rifle range, which appeared to be cordoned off this morning. No live ammunition is kept on the premises, an insider claimed.

"Heartbreaking tributes to Emma Pattison’s daughter Lettie, 7, as cops probe ‘double murder suicide’","A SEVEN-year-old girl found dead on school grounds with her parents was ""perfect in every way"", a woman who looked after her has said.  The bodies of little Lettie Pattison, her headteacher mum Emma and accountant dad George were discovered at Epsom College, Surrey, at around 1am on Sunday. Police said they are not looking for anybody else in connection with the ""isolated"" incident, but have given no further details about the deaths. Gunshots were reportedly heard the same night, and officers are understood to be treating it as a double murder and suicide.  Detectives suspect George, 39, killed Emma, 45, and Lettie before taking his own life. The ""unimaginable"" tragedy has shaken the school community and devastated those that knew the ""lovely"" family.  Chloe Rathbone, 27, a nursery worker who previously looked after Lettie, told The Times: ""I am utterly heartbroken over this news.  ""They were such a lovely family and Lettie was perfect in every way."" John Wildgoose, a photographer who took the family's portrait last month for the school's announcement of Emma's headship, described the youngster as ""an absolute angel"".  He added: ""It was amazing how she was for the camera, it’s heartbreaking. ""To me there was an obvious bond within the family, they seemed very together and excited about their future."" Emma became the first female head of £42,000-a-year Epsom College in September 2022 after six years at Croydon High School in South London.  She lived on site with her daughter, Labrador puppy Bella and chartered accountant husband George, who ran a management consultancy firm called Tanglewood 2016, according to Companies House.  Their family home is understood to be surrounded by other properties occupied by teachers and school workers and adjacent to the school's rifle range. The indoor shooting centre appeared to be part of the police cordon yesterday, though cops confirmed it was not part of the incident scene.  Despite moving to Epsom from their £1.5million property in Caterham last year, the Pattisons reportedly only recently finished transporting the last of their belongings.  Removal vans were spotted outside the four-bedroom detached home, where they had lived since 2014, in the last few weeks.  Another old neighbour told The Telegraph they seemed like a ""normal, happy family"". They added: ""I used to see Emma going running. I didn’t see George so much, he was quite quiet and kept himself to himself, but their daughter was so happy. ""You used to hear her playing in the garden, she was always asking them questions and just seemed like a happy, inquisitive little girl."" Another described Lettie as a ""lovely, well brought up"" girl who always wanted to play with her dog.  And a third said the Pattisons appeared ""quite successful"" as they owned a Range Rover and a BMW 8 Series.  Before Christmas, Emma seemed enthusiastic about her future at the elite school, which counts presenter Jeremy Vine and ex-MI6 spy chief Sir John Scarlett as ex-pupils.  On the college podcast, she excitedly told teenagers how much she had loved her first few weeks at the helm and that she was looking forward to the coming months and years.  The only suggestion of any difficulty was that the move had put pressure on her family and she found it tricky to find time for herself. Emma said at the beginning of December: ""I am absolutely loving my time here so far. ""It has been very, very busy, but absolutely wonderful. ""There is so much to look ahead to and be excited about."" But she later added that the transition had been a ""really big change"" for her family and hinted that between having breakfasts with students, attending sports matches on Saturdays and meeting as many mums and dads as possible, there was little time to pursue hobbies. She did, however, go on to say that she enjoyed travelling, reading, playing the piano and singing - as well as going for jogs. A former neighbour told The Times they often heard piano music coming from the Caterham house and saw Emma going out for regular runs. They added: ""They had all the appearances of being totally happy and successful."" Epsom College scooped the top prize at the Independent Schools of the Year Awards 2022. It was also the winner of the Student Wellbeing Award thanks to its approach to mental health.  ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21299733/emma-pattison-epsom-college-daughter-tributes/

My daughter was stolen from hospital at 3 days old – it took 17 years to find her but my nightmare had just begun,"GAZING at her newborn daughter, young mum Celeste Nurse felt a rush of love and thought excitedly of the beautiful nursery she’d decorated for her new arrival. But two days later, on April 30 1997, her world fell apart when a woman posing as a nurse picked up baby Zephany and calmly walked out of the Cape Town hospital as Celeste slept. Despite frantic searches and a nationwide police hunt, it would be 17 years before she would see Zephany again - when a bizarre twist of fate brought them together. Tragically, the joyful reunion led to more heartache for Celeste and husband Morné, as Zephany - now known as Miché -  took the side of kidnapper Lavona Solomon, who had raised her as her own and was jailed for ten years over the crime. Now, in an emotional interview ahead of the documentary Girl Taken, on Channel 5 tonight, mum-of-four Celeste opens up about the heartbreak of losing her first-born child not once but twice. “When she was taken from hospital, it felt like somebody had ripped the heart out of my chest,” she says. “The saddest part was when I arrived home and saw the cot standing empty, the bottles unfilled, the toys and the nappy bag. I collapsed on the floor and just broke down.  “I was supposed to come home with my baby and the baby wasn't there. “Even talking about it today, I get a feeling of fear, heartache, sadness and a sick feeling in my stomach.” Although they never gave up hope, the tragic loss also caused the couple’s marriage to break down. Celeste, 43, is now rebuilding her relationship with Zephany and reveals they had a breakthrough this month when kidnapper Lavona finally confessed the truth, after years of denial.   “It’s extremely difficult when your own child rejects you,” says Celeste. “I was devastated because I lost my daughter all over again. “But we are in an ongoing relationship and there’s now a completely different feeling to what we had a few months ago. I love her so much, like I love all my children, and it's going to blossom.” Celeste fell pregnant at 17, just a few months after meeting “soulmate” Morné - then 18 - and the pair wed six months later.   Despite their youth, the pair were overjoyed to become parents and Celeste says she remembers the moment she first held Zephany in her arms as clearly as if it were yesterday. “She looked like little Simba, from the Lion King, and it was the most extraordinary, amazing day of my life,” she says.  “I couldn't wait to take this little bundle of joy home. I couldn't wait to share with my family. We had everything planned, she had her own room and we were extremely excited.” As Zephany was delivered by emergency caesarian, in Cape Town’s Groote Schuur Hospital, Celeste was given morphine for the pain, which made her drowsy. Through the haze, she remembers the baby crying and a woman in a nurse’s uniform asking if she could pick her up.  Celeste then fell asleep and was woken by another nurse asking “where is your baby?” Before long, they realised Zephany had been abducted and all hell broke loose. “At first I thought ‘this can't be real’,” she says. “We ran down the stairs, searching every floor but she was nowhere to be seen - the baby was gone. I was hysterical and no one could calm me down.” By the morning, police had put out a plea to the kidnapper to hand the baby back, appealing to the public for tip-offs. Still not fully recovered from her operation, Celeste had to endure two more days in the maternity ward. “I was surrounded by babies crying every night,” she says. “I couldn't handle it. I needed to get home. I needed to find my child.” Despite a number of false leads, the couple refused to give up hope, even holding a birthday party for Zephany every year. “At night I’d hear noises made by the neighbour's cat and think my baby had been left outside the door,” Celeste says. “I would ask mums walking with prams if I could look at their baby and every time I saw kids of Zephany's age I'd speak to the mum. Some parents didn’t like it but, once I explained, most were kind and understood.” Initially reluctant to have more children, and terrified of giving birth at hospital, Celeste and Morné went on to have daughter Cassidy, born in 2001, then son Joshua, in 2006 and another daughter Micah, in 2007. But Celeste admits her children could never have a “normal childhood” because they were afraid to let them out of their sight. Although initially united in grief, the couple blamed each other for their loss and eventually split in 2015, shortly before Celeste was diagnosed with cervical cancer and began a gruelling course of treatment. “That was one of the worst times of my life,” she says. “Every day I prayed I wouldn’t die before I found my daughter.” In the same year, an extraordinary quirk of fate led the family to their lost girl. Cassidy, then 14, had just transferred to Zwaanswyck High School when she was told by several pupils and teachers that she looked the spitting image of an older pupil called Miché Solomon. When the pair bumped into each other, they felt an instant connection and became close friends, despite the age gap, with Cassidy sharing the family tragedy with her. Miché tells the documentary: “I felt a sense of protection over her, like a big sister because I could pick up that that was what she needed.  “Because of everything she told me, I felt that I could be that for her.” Seeing a selfie of Cassidy and Miché, in which they looked almost identical, Morné began to believe she could be his missing daughter and, after she told him she was born on April 30 1997, he was convinced. The couple informed the police who found there was no entry for Miché Solomon on the birth register for that date and no record of her birth at any local hospitals. The 17-year-old was called into the headmaster’s office where social workers told her she might be the Nurses’ missing baby and that her “mum” Lavona was actually her kidnapper. “I had no doubt that this was a lie because that's how much I believed in my mum,” she says. However, a DNA test quickly proved she was Zephany - and Lavona was arrested and charged.  Bewildered and confused, Zephany was reunited with her biological parents on February 25, 2016. “I'll never forget that day, when I saw my daughter again for the first time,” says Celeste. “I just completely choked up. I didn't see the 17-year-old child. I saw my three-day-old baby and I broke down in tears.  Everyone was crying, even the social workers.  “She stared at me thinking, ‘What is wrong with this woman?’ and when I hugged her she didn’t really hug me back. “I thought, ‘This is where the pain is going to start. This is where everything is going to be torn apart inside myself.’ “There was always a possibility I’d have to let her be with the other family and cut all ties because this was so hard for her.” Lavona denied the kidnapping, telling police she had bought a baby for 3,000 Rand - around £150 - from a woman who handed her over at a train station. She had earlier suffered a miscarriage and had not told husband Michael, who believed the girl they raised together was his. When Lavona was jailed, in March 2016, Zephany turned her back on her biological parents. Celeste says she understands. “At the time we were at our worst,” she says. “I was diagnosed with cancer and was having treatment and we were arguing constantly. We were divorced and living with different partners. “We were broken people - we are broken people - and Zephany came in and she saw her biological parents were a complete mess, their lives turned upside down.” When Zephany released a book in 2014, which was highly critical of Morné, Celeste says she was “heartbroken.” But in 2017, Zephany became a mum herself, to daughter Sophia - and a thaw set in. “Once I saw Sophia, my first grandchild, she was such a beautiful baby and I was so excited so all the negative emotions just disappeared. I'm so in love with Sofia,"" says Celeste. “My relationship [with Zephany] also started building because she learned the responsibilities of becoming a mum, how it feels to give birth and to experience that emotion with Sophia. “She told me, 'Mummy, I never knew being a mum would be such a beautiful thing. To have somebody come and taken Sophia away - I don’t know what I’d do. So she understands me more.” As the family began to heal, Celeste and Morné also reunited and, in 2020, they tied the knot for a second time. Now a grandmother-of-four, and cancer free, she crossed another hurdle earlier this month at a parole hearing for Lavona - where she finally confessed to Zephany.  “I was worried about coming face to face with Lavona again but Zephany was there, and she told her, 'I'm here to support my biological parents', which left me in tears,” she says. “Lavona was so cold, there was no remorse. But she said she understood and that day, she finally admitted she was the woman who walked out of the hospital with my baby.  “It was like something heavy was lifted off my shoulders because now my daughter knows the truth and it's coming from the horse's mouth.  “After the hearing, Zephany said ‘I'm sorry, Mummy. I love you so much’. We just held each other and she wouldn't let me go. “Then I told her ‘You are not Miche Solomon, you are Zephany Joy Nurse. The Zephany I gave birth to has been silenced for too long by this woman - and it's time to take your name back and live your life.  “From that moment, everything completely changed. I found my baby girl.” Girl, Taken, airs tonight on Channel 5 at 10pm. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19307345/girl-taken-paramount-zephany-nurse-celeste-baby/
Who is Shamima Begum’s husband Yago Riedijk?,"SHAMIMA BEGUM as an ISIS bride who left London for Syria in 2015. Here, we take a look at her marriage to Yago Riedijk and find out more about him. Riedijk, 29, left Arnhem, Holland, for Syria in October 2014. Shamima Begum married the Dutchman, then 23, 10 days after landing in the war-torn country in 2015. The couple had three children, all of whom died. According to his neighbours in Arnhem, Riedijk was brought up in a ""lovely"" middle-class family before converting to Islam and joining ISIS. During an interview with The Times in 2019, Begum said the last time she saw her husband was when they fled the village of Baghuz, ISIS’ final stronghold, at the beginning of February that year. He surrendered to a group of fighters allied to the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Begum was taken to the al-Hawl refugee camp while Riedijk is being held in another camp. In footage exclusively obtained by The Sun in 2020, he revealed Begum received benefits from Isis and got paid twice as much as other jihadis. When asked whether Isis were paying Shamima when he was in jail, he said: “Yes, my friend was getting my wage. Luckily they did give that to her.” At the time, he was asked what message he would send to his wife from behind bars. He said: ""Stay strong, even though it’s very difficult all the things we’ve been through. ""I’d tell her to make use of your time, do whatever you can and learn whatever you can in order to build a future for yourself… for us. ""In terms of taking care of future children, in terms of being a future housewife."" It appears they are no longer married although their status is not entirely clear. In an interview in July 2021, Riedijk confirmed he was married to Begum and that the pair had agreed a dowry. Riedikj claimed the young Isis bride is manipulating Western governments to try and come home. Begum though said in a September 2021 interview with Good Morning Britain that she would ""rather die"" than return to Isis. Asked whether she was groomed by ISIS, she said: ""I think yes, I was groomed and taken advantage of and manipulated into coming."" She said that at the time she did not know ISIS ""was a death cult"". Speaking from northern Syria, she added: ""I thought it was an Islamic community that I was joining. ""I was being fed a lot of information on the internet by people in Isis telling me I need to come because I can’t be a good Muslim in the UK."" It is understood that Reidijk is now behind bars in a Kurdish-run prison in Syria. When ex-squaddie Alan Duncan managed to track him down he told the Daily Record he had met Riedijk at an unspecified ""intelligence centre"". His precise location is not known.

These people are VERY famous but you’ve never seen them like this before – do you know who they are?,"YOU probably feel the instant flush of familiarity when you see these images and wonder why you recognise these seemingly normal people.  But it's actually a series of historical figures who have been given an artificial intelligence facelift to gauge how they would look today.  The eerily accurate AI transformations were produced by content creator and tech whizz Hidreley Diao. Using a combination of Photoshop and three mobile apps - FaceApp, Gradiente and Remini - to revive iconic VIPs.  The incredible digital artist has managed to modernise the likes of George Washington, Henry VIII, the Mona Lisa, Napoleon, and Leonardo da Vinci. Diao, who works for online mag Bored Panda, said he dedicates two hours to transforming each historical portrait into a modern-day photograph. The Brazilian explained he tries ""to bring them into our world"" by creating scarily realistic replicas of ancient legends.  ""When choosing the character, the most time-consuming thing is to find an image that resembles the historical figure,"" he said.  ""I spend hours in image databases until I get the right picture.  ""Each individual piece takes up to 2 hours, which is nothing compared to AI-unassisted methods."" Diao shares the fruits of his labour on his Instagram page, sending social media users wild with his work.  The AI artist has amassed a whopping 141,000 followers since he began exploring the world of AI - which he describes as a ""world without limits."" He said his skills were improving with each and every design he makes, encouraging him to branch out further afield.  The Photoshop genius can also breathe new life into cartoon characters such as Ned Flanders and Bart Simpson.  Diao said: ""When we watch some animation, it is natural to accept the cartoonish proportions of the characters without any problems, after all, we are quite used to this type of trait. ""But what if, as in a spell, they became real, flesh and blood? I tried to bring them into our world through artificial intelligence."" ""I wanted to try something out myself, and so I dove into the world of AI.  ""In terms of how they all turned out, I'm more and more pleased with the results with each post I make."" The creator says AI-assisted art has ""no boundaries"" and he is currently cooking up an exciting new project to take on next. Daio revealed he will try to depict what some prematurely deceased celebrities would have looked like if they were still alive, adding: ""I hope it will turn out great."" It comes as one technology programme started creating uncomfortably realistic images of people who never existed.  And another AI image generator has imagined what the scariest human on earth looks like. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/21296625/these-people-are-very-famous-but-who-are-they/
Exact date you must use gift vouchers before major high street store closes for good – or lose cash,"SHOPPERS have just days left to use gift vouchers at a major retailer before it shuts its doors for good - so use it or lose it. High street retailer M&Co was bought by Yours Clothing last week after falling into administration. However, all 170 shops will start shutting their doors from April.  Shoppers who have gift vouchers for M&Co must spend them by February 12 - if they don’t use it, they’ll lose it.  M&Co will accept gift cards in store provided the value of the gift voucher is no more than half the total price of items purchased. No new gift cards are being sold, and no balances added to existing gift cards.  Shoppers should be able to redeem their vouchers in any M&Co store.  Gift vouchers are no longer being accepted for online orders. In addition, those signed up to M&Co's loyalty scheme will no longer benefit from it. Loyalty cards won't be accepted and no new customers are able to sign up.  Those still part of the loyalty scheme won't be able to earn points on any purchases made from now on.  If you have any questions, you can contact M&Co by email at custor-services@mandco.com. Yours Clothing bought M&Co last week. However, as the deal included just the brand, the 170 stores are set to close - and this process is expected to begin after the Easter weekend. Administrator Teneo said stores will continue to trade over the next few weeks. However, at least 20 stores have confirmed on Facebook that they'll be shutting from April. The exact dates each shop will close is yet to be revealed so it might be wise to return any items you have sooner rather than later. The Peterborough-based group also owns menswear line BadRhino, womenswear retailer Long Tall Sally and maternity brand Bump It Up Maternity. It is currently running a closing down sale before the stores disappear. Shoppers can get between 30-50% off sale online and up to 60% off in-store. Administrators at Teneo put the bust business up for sale with an auction deadline for interested buyers. They blame M&Co’s collapse on the sharp rise in costs while squeezed household budgets have also depressed sales.  Nearly 2,000 jobs are now at risk though we don't know for sure if and when redundancies will be made. M&Co isn't the only store to go into administration and shut its shop doors. Stationery retailer Paperchase collapsed into administration this week after it failed to find a buyer. Supermarket giant Tesco quickly stepped up to buy rights to the brand, as they plan to sell Paperchase items in stores. When a business is liquidated, they will look to sell stock for as much as possible to pay back creditors. Stores may disappear off the high street within weeks but the process could take up to two months. Major burger chain Byron Burger also recently fell into administration and is set to close nine restaurants immediately. Further popular chains including Las Iguanas, Cafe Rouge and Bella Italia also fell victim to the pandemic. In December 2022, pub chain Wetherspoons announced it would be closing a total of 39 pubs after being hit by soaring inflation. While H&M also announced it would be shutting a handful of its stores. H&M has closed branches in recent months, with more to follow this year. Do you have a money problem that needs sorting?

Thousands can get up to £350 direct to bank accounts to help with energy bills – check if you can apply,"THOUSANDS can get an extra £350 to go towards essential costs this spring. The cash comes as part of Powys Council's Fuel Support Scheme, which grants funding to vulnerable homes.  As the cost of living rises and the cold weather continues, most councils are dishing out support to help households pay for essentials.  In England, the cash comes from a £421million pot called the Household Support Fund, allowing hard-up homes to get help with food, energy bills and fuel costs.  But Powys Council in Wales has its own fuel scheme which grants the lowest income families a maximum payment of £350 to go towards fuel bills.  Here's how it works.  Any household receiving one of the following benefits could be entitled to a one-off £200 payment from the council: You'll need to have received them between September 1, 2022 and January 31, 2023 to be eligible.  You might also be able to claim the cash if a child or dependent adult living with you receives one of these: There's also a chance to claim an extra £150 if you live off the gas grid, making your total maximum payment £350. Please note you can only claim one payment per property and you must be liable to pay Council Tax.  If you're not, the person who claims must be the one paying for energy bills.  If you've been in receipt of the Council Tax Reduction Scheme or the Unpaid Carers Grant scheme, you'll be contacted directly to apply.  If not, you'll need to apply through the council website yourself.  Here's what you'll need when applying: If you're successful, you'll be paid as soon as possible.  The deadline for all payments to be made is during March 2023. You'll get an email when a payment is due to be made soon.  Your local council will likely have its own version of the scheme going and you should get in contact with them to find out more. But be quick - while the deadline for councils to hand out the latest tranche of HSF cash support is March 31, 2023, it's done on a first-come-first-serve basis. For example, thousands of residents in Plymouth are due electronic vouchers to help pay for food and other essentials at supermarkets. And eligible households can get up to £180 in free supermarket vouchers depending on their circumstances. Thousands of residents in North Yorkshire are also due electronic supermarket vouchers worth up to £325. Millions on benefits and Universal Credit will receive an extra one-off £900. Eight million households currently get cost-of-living payments worth up to £650, but eligibility criteria could change under any new rules. Pensioners have also started getting a £300 one-off payment. The current pensioner cost of living payment is being handed out to millions on a low income. You qualify under the current rules if you normally get the winter fuel payment, but this could change under the new rules. The £300 cost of living payment is paid on top of the other winter support. You'll need to be: Struggling families are eligible for the Warm House Discount to help them tackle the cost of living. The scheme is where eligible households can get £150 off their electricity bill each winter - but you'll have to wait until the colder months to get the money off.

Five everyday dishwasher mistakes that could ruin your machine and cost you hundreds,"THE way you load and use your dishwasher could be costing you extra cash. Rising energy bills and the cost of living has us rethinking the way we go about daily tasks. The average dishwasher uses between 1.2kWh and 1.5kWh per load, according to research by Compare The Market. The device contributes to 8% of your overall electricity bill, according to the Energy Saving Trust. So using it correctly could have a big impact on running costs. Bear in mind that the exact costs can vary depending on usage and the dishwasher model you have.  Here are five common mistakes that could be costing hundreds a year - and how to fix them. One of the most important ways we keep your dishwasher in good condition is by descaling it, according to Leon Doyle, ecosystems director at Haier Group, This reduces the amount of limescale that can build up over time. But if you allow the hard water scum to build up, then the energy efficiency rating could drop - this could cost you an extra £100 (at least) a year. An appliance energy rating rates how efficient properties are from A (the best) to G (the worst) - so the lower the the rating, the more expensive it will most likely cost to run.  You can find your property's energy rating on the government's website. Limescale build up affects the rating because the more limescale it has, the harder the machine has to work and so the more energy it uses.  ""You can drop an energy rating every year that you don’t run a descaler programme,"" he said. ""Over two years you could be looking at 15% extra electricity [use]."" Leon said that by year four of having your dishwasher, it could cost as much as 100% more to run. Leon added that a triple A graded machine could cost 50p to run, that's £182 if you used it every day for a year. But a grade B (which is only one grade lower) might cost 75p to run which would cost users £273 a year. That's nearly a £100 lost if your machine is one rating lower. And if the energy rating continues going down, your costs will only go up meaning you could end up paying hundreds.   This will work well with the point made above, Leon said.  You'll most likely need a timer to be able to turn your dishwasher on at 4 in the morning (unless you're happy to set your alarm). The timer will do this automatically but it'll also switch your dishwasher off. Leon said that if you don't have a timer on your dishwasher, then you could purchase a timer plug which will connect to your device and switch it off.   They use a small amount of energy per hour and will make sure your dishwasher stops using energy once the cycle has finished.  At the time of writing, a timer plug was going for £7.45 on Amazon so it's a tiny amount compared to how much your dishwasher could cost you during the day.  A timer plug could save households £147 a year according to British Gas.  Curry's' David added: Some smart plugs also allow users to input their electricity supplier’s prices into their respective apps, so usage can be monitored in real time – great for busy households with lots of gadgets on the go at any one time."" Another common mistake Leon said is made by many people is not cleaning their dishwasher filter.  This part of the machine not only cleans the dish water that's used during a wash cycle, but also helps to protect the dishwasher pump from getting clogged up with bits of food. So if you’ve never thought to clean your dishwasher filter, then you might want to do it today. Leon said the cost of it breaking if you don't clean the filter, plus the call out fees and spare parts will outweigh any cleaning products.  The average call-out fee costs £105, according to Checkatrade.com. Rinse aid, which can be used to clean it, costs as little as £2.75 from Amazon. Plus, not cleaning the filer could contribute to decreasing the efficiency rating of your dishwasher and therefore increasing the cost of energy.  Finally, David said the using the eco-cycle option could save households money. ""By switching a dishwater onto an eco-setting, it can save the water use by 20-40% for each clean. ""Heat pumps on washer dryers are also another feature to look out for when thinking about upgrading your appliances.  ""These help to ensure the drying process is gentler on clothes while keeping running costs down, so you don’t have to worry about running up a hefty electric bill."" And Skintdad.com said households can say around £37 a year by using the eco setting on a dishwasher.  Do you have a money problem that needs sorting?

BP reports record $28billion profits as millions struggle with higher energy bills,"BP has been slammed after announcing a $28billion profit despite millions struggling with higher energy bills.  The firm has recorded the highest profits made in its 114-year history at $28billion (£23billion). This is nearly double the profit BP made the year before, which was $12.8bn.  Profit more than doubled BP last year as it benefited from runaway gas prices caused by the war in Ukraine. The company said that it would invest an additional $8billion (£6.6billion) each in the energy transition, and in oil and gas. Political and environmental campaigners criticised the profit jump as ""sickening"". Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now, said: “It’s high time governments mandated fossil fuel companies to start paying up for their role in the climate crisis, starting with these enormous profits announced today."" While Friends of the Earth said BP’s profits “will be yet more salt in the wound for millions of people who’ve struggled to afford to stay warm and well this winter”. The profits come as UK households are facing higher energy bills in April when the Energy Price Guarantee increases to £3,000. Energy prices have soared in recent months following the invasion of Ukraine, resulting in massive profits for energy companies. The BP profits come as Shell also recorded the highest profit made in its 115-year history at $40billion (£32bn) - nearly $110million a day. The oil and gas company posted profits of $9.81bn in the final quarter of last year, compared with $6.4bn a year in 2021. That took annual adjusted profits to $39.87bn in 2022, a huge increase on the $19.3bn notched up in 2021. The figure represents one of the highest profits ever recorded by a UK company. There is financial support available for hard-up households. Millions of off-grid households can now get up to £200 as another form of energy bill support through the Alternative Fuel Payment (AFP). Those who are eligible will have had the £200 yesterday whilst businesses who are off the grid will get a separate £150 on March 10. To be off the gas grid means you don't use mains gas.  That means you'll only get the cash if you warm your home using alternative energy sources such as heating oil, biomass and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). For example, there's the £400 payment which has been split into six monthly instalments. Payments have been made since October, and the final payment will be made in March. For the majority of energy customers, their monthly bills are automatically discounted. However, households with traditional pre-payment meters are being sent vouchers to redeem at their nearest top-up point instead. Also, millions on benefits are in line for up to £1,350 in free cash from spring. The help is aimed to help soften the blow of high energy bills, food costs and other necessities. The first chunk of the £900 cost of living payment will be paid directly into claimants' accounts. Unlike last year's help, this cost of living payment will be paid in three, not two, instalments. More than eight million people will get the help directly to their bank accounts, and the £900 help will be paid over the financial year.

Archie Battersbee’s devastated mum now says she doesn’t know how he died after first blaming TikTok challenge,"ARCHIE Battersbee's mum told an inquest today she doesn't know how the teen died after first blaming an online challenge. Archie died on August 6 when his life support was withdrawn despite a landmark legal battle to keep him alive. Mum Hollie Dance had discovered him unconscious at home in Essex on April 7. She previously said she believed he was taking part in an online challenge. At a full inquest into Archie's death today, Hollie said she cannot be sure of her original claims. The mum added: ""I still don’t know if Archie was trying the blackout challenge on April 7 or before.  ""I still don’t know what he was watching on TikTok."" Hollie also revealed the harrowing moments after she discovered Archie unresponsive in his room. She told the hearing she ran outside ""screaming"" as an ambulance was scrambled to the family home. Hollie added: ""I was asked to sit on the stairs. I was crying hysterically ""I was saying ‘please don’t leave mummy, I love you little man’.  ""I repeated that over and over again, I just didn’t want him to leave me. Everything seemed in slow motion.” Hollie said on April 7, she and Archie had lunch together at Pure Vegan before heading to Tesco. The pair then returned home from their ""normal day"" and she made a call to her partner. Hollie said her son then came in with the pet rabbit before they discussed a potential trip to the cinema later. She said: ""That was the last time I saw Archie before I found him unconscious five or ten minutes later.” The court also heard Archie had spoken to friends about ""negative thoughts"" in the weeks before he collapsed. Archie's parents launched a mammoth legal battle to keep their son alive after he was found unconscious. But they lost their fight at every hurdle, with judges ruling that keeping his life support switched on was not in the youngster's ""best interests"". Hollie said today she always strived to “protect Archie from the dangers of the world”. The inquest continues.

Three crucial Nicola Bulley clues that sparked dive expert to brand the case ‘odd’ as search teams scour river,"THREE clues led an expert diver leading the search for Nicola Bulley to brand the whole disappearance ""odd"". Peter Faulding said today if his dive team cannot find the mum-of-two today, his ""gut"" feeling is there may be other reasons for her vanishing. The search and rescue expert of 20 years said signs of drowning, lack of evidence at the scene and Nicola's clothing at the time suggest she may not be in the River Wyre. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: ""Normally when a person drowns, if they are left a number of days they don't move very far. ""This is not a fast tidal river. So I would have expected her to be found by the police divers by now."" He went on to tell reporters that he believes Nicola may not be in the river ""at all"". Analysing her January 27 disappearance further, Mr Faulding said it ""feels odd"" there were no marks at the scene. He added how it was also peculiar that not one person heard screams or that she was wearing clothes that would have absorbed water quickly. Despite his reservations, he said: ""We are putting the maximum into this. We just want to help the family. The more hands on deck, the better. ""There is a missing part of a jigsaw that cannot be completed. It is all a bit odd."" On Tuesday, Mr Faulding also alleged Nicola's phone - found still connected to a meeting when she vanished - may also be a ""decoy"". The leader of Specialist Group International (SGI) - who are scouring the river for the mum - even has a ""gut"" feeling a third party could be responsible. He told BBC Breakfast today: “If Nicola is not in that stretch of river today my view is that there is a third party involved and this was a decoy placed by the river. “It could have been placed as a decoy, there is not enough CCTV to cover particular areas here. The police are working hard in the background to cover everything. “It’s so unusual, we’ve got no clear information to go on."" He explained he had a similar incident in the search for missing Laura Torn in 2003 where a stiletto was placed to distract investigators. But Nicola's case has left him ""well and truly baffled"", the veteran diver of 25 years told TalkTV. Police continue to work on the hypothesis that the mortgage worker ""sadly"" fell into the River Wyre. It comes as cops focus search efforts on a track from the fields, where Nicola was last seen, to Garstang Road in St Michael's on Wyre. Lancashire Constabulary said on Tuesday they believe this route may hold vital clues and have appealed to drivers and cyclists to come forward with any dashcam footage from the morning of January 27 when the mum vanished. In a statement, the force said they used data from the mum's fitbit fitness watch and mobile phone to scale up efforts on the path. They added: ""We have also spoken to numerous witnesses... and searched the derelict house on the other side of the river as well as any empty caravans in the vicinity."" The force said they will be sending letters to travellers who they think may have been driving down Garstang Road that morning. Only drivers with dashcam footage are asked to email NicolaBulleyInvestigation@lancashire.police.uk to let police know. Nicola's pal Emma White said police had been working to get data off the missing mum's fitbit fitness watch. Yesterday's search for Nicola, 45, focused downstream on the tidal area of the River Wyre but Tuesday's search will take place further upstream. The search area will include and go beyond the area where Nicola's belongings were found on a bench near Garstang Road, in St Michael's on Wyre. It is a non-tidal area of the river. Mr Faulding explained: ""If Nicola is in the river, she could have even fallen further up, we don't know. ""The key focus has been around the bench area, we have got to rule out everything here. ""We can't just go for the bench, we have got to cover the whole stretch of river to make sure there is no untoward circumstances here."" The mum, from nearby Inskip, disappeared after dropping her children off at school on Friday January 27. She was last seen around 9.15am that day. On Monday Lancashire Police released fresh CCTV images of Nicola from the day she disappeared. In a statement released the same day through cops, partner Paul Ansell said: ""I have two little girls who miss their mummy desperately and who need her back."" And a heartbreaking video of her kids looking at search helicopters heard Sophia, six, say: ""Them helicopters, they're looking for mummy.""

Who was Emma Pattison’s husband George?,"THE sudden deaths of a headteacher and her family have shocked the nation. Emma Pattison was found dead alongside her husband and daughter on February 5, 2023. Here is some more information on her husband, George. George Pattison was a chartered accountant, born in March 1983. He was director of a management consultancy firm called Tanglewood 2016. He assumed his role on October 26, 2016, according to Companies House. George and wife Emma lived on the grounds of Epsom College, with their daughter Lettie and pet Labrador, Bella. Emma was an esteemed headteacher, who took the helm at the college in September 2022, becoming the first female to be appointed into the role. She had previously been head of Croydon High School, a role which she held from 2016 to 2022. On February 5, 2023, George, 39, along with his wife, 45, and daughter Lettie, seven, were found dead on the grounds of the school. Police investigating the deaths are understood to be treating the tragedy as a double murder and suicide. Detectives suspect Pattison killed his wife and little Lettie before taking his own life. Dr Alastair Wells, Chair of the Board of Governors at Epsom College, wrote: “On behalf of everyone at Epsom College, I want to convey our utter shock and disbelief at this tragic news. ""Our immediate thoughts and condolences are with Emma’s family, friends and loved ones, and to the many pupils and colleagues whose lives she enriched throughout her distinguished career.  On Sunday, February 5, 2023, Detective Chief Inspector Kimball Edey said: “On behalf of Surrey Police, my team, and I, I first want to express my sincerest condolences to the friends and family of Emma, Lettie, and George, as well as to the students and staff of Epsom College, for their tragic loss.  “I want to give my assurance that we will conduct a thorough investigation into what took place last night, and hope to be able to bring some peace in these traumatic circumstances. I would ask that their privacy is respected at this very difficult time.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21286579/who-emma-pattisons-husband-george/
Met Police rapist David Carrick caged for torturing victims by locking them naked in cupboard in 17-year reign of terror,"A SADISTIC Met Police officer who raped and abused multiple women in a 17-year reign of terror has been jailed for life. David Carrick, 48, tortured his victims as he abused his position in the police to ""charm and beguile"" them. The monster locked women naked in a cupboard under the stairs for ten hours at a time, controlled what they ate and branded them his ""slaves"". He was revealed as one of the UK's worst serial rapists last month after admitting 49 charges - including 24 counts of rape. Some of the multiple-incident counts relate to at least 85 separate offences -including at least 71 sexual offences and 48 rapes. Shockingly, it also emerged Carrick came to police attention nine times before his arrest after rape and domestic violence allegations were made against him. He has now jailed for life with a minimum term of 30 years and 239 days after the gruesome extent of his sick crimes were revealed for the first time. At his two-day sentencing hearing, the court was told Carrick attempted to kill himself while on remand at Belmarsh. Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said this was a ""self-pitying reaction to the shame brought on you by these proceedings rather than remorse"". The judge branded the serial predator a ""grave danger"" to women but said the crimes did not meet the threshold for a whole life tariff that would see him die in jail. She added: ""These convictions represent a spectacular downfall for a man charged with upholding the law and empowered to do so even to the extent of being authorised to bear a firearm in the execution of his duty. ""Behind a public appearance of propriety and trustworthiness, you took monstrous advantage of women drawn into intimate relationships with you.  “You brazenly raped and sexually assaulted a number of women, some very brutally, and you behaved as if you were untouchable. ""You were bold and at times relentless, trusting that no victim would overcome her shame and fear to report you. ""For nearly two decades, you were proved right but now a combination of those 12 women, by coming forward, and your police colleagues, by acting on their evidence, have exposed you and brought you low. ""You have lost your liberty, your job and your status. You have before you the prospect of a difficult time in custody for many years."" Southwark Crown Court was told Carrick would ""often humiliate his victims in a number of different ways"". He used his police baton and handcuffs during attacks and sent one victim a photo with a work-issue handgun, saying: ""Remember I am the boss"". Two women were kept in the tiny cupboard under his stairs while others were urinated on or hit with a belt. He put his hands around one victim's throat and told her he was ""going to be the last thing she saw"" and wielded a knife at another. Prosecutor Tom Little KC said he invited one woman back to his home after claiming he was the ""safest person that she could be with and that he was a police officer"". Once there, he told her ""she couldn't go"" and ""grabbed her by the hair and put his hand round her mouth, dragging her backwards"". The prosecutor said: ""He threw her on the bed. He held her down. He grabbed her arms. He had taken his shirt off. She bit his arm and he put his hand behind the bed. ""He searched for something and then put a black handgun to her head and said to her 'you are not going'. ""She froze"". Carrick also attacked another as she sat on the toilet after developing a sick interest in ""urination for sexual gratification"". And he offered a victim he raped five times £1,000-a-month to be his ""s**t"" as he coercively controlled her. She recalled how in one attack, she was ""sweating from the pain and crying"". The woman was left feeling suicidal and dropped from a size 14 to a six after Carrick controlled how much she ate. In another chilling encounter, he stood naked and waved goodbye to a victim he raped ""as if nothing had happened"". Controlling Carrick also told a victim she ""belonged to him and that she must obey him"" - including with the clothes she wore and what she spent money on. He threatened the woman with a police baton and ""punished"" her by shutting her in the cupboard under the stairs. She told how she would scream out in pain while being repeatedly raped by Carrick but didn't tell anyone as the fiend was a ""police officer and very powerful"". Describing Carrick's 17-year reign of terror, Mr Little KC said: ""If the offending had to be accurately and fairly summarised, it was systematic. ""It was catalogue of violent and brutal sexual offences perpetrated on multiple victims, whether he was in a controlling or coercive relationship with them or not, or even if it was just a single occasion. ""The reality was that it did not matter who the victim was, the reality was, if he had the opportunity, he would rape them, sexually abuse or assault them and humiliate them. ""Some of his victims were either appreciably older or younger than him - they were all, in their own ways, vulnerable."" Carrick worked for the Met's Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command unit - the same department as Sarah Everard's killer Wayne Couzens. It is not clear if the pair knew each other while working at the elite unit at the same time. The gun cop, whose colleagues branded him ""B*****d Dave"", met some of his victims on dating apps such as Tinder and Badoo. He would flash his warrant card to lure the women into a false sense of security and told them: ""I’m a police officer, you can trust me”. The monster also boasted about meeting the Prime Minister in his role guarding parliamentary, government and diplomatic buildings. Evil Carrick would appear charming at first before spending time ""developing relationships to sustain his appetite for degradation and control"". He forced women to clean his home naked, carried out degrading acts against them, cut them off from family including their children and whipped them with belts. One victim was forced into a tiny cupboard smaller than a dog crate, while others were forced to perform sex acts until they ""fought for breath"". Carrick also controlled how much they ate and when they slept, telling them: “You’re only allowed to eat this much of an apple today”. The monster would abuse his position in the police to terrify his victims into silence. The women ranged from a school pal to a previous abuse victim, with some abused at the home in Stevenage he shared with his pet snake. Another victim claimed she was attacked after she woke up naked and covered in a sick in a hotel following drinks with Carrick in St Albans. Carrick allegedly raped her while calling himself a ""dominant b*****d"". She came forward after seeing another case of a rapist police officer, but the offence against her has been left to lie on the court file. When officers swooped on his home, Carrick told them ""not again"" before giving a ""no comment"" interview. A sweep of his electronic devices showed chilling searches for pornography including words such as ""extreme"" and ""painful"". Carrick was described as ""very persuasive but also manipulative"" to the point of being ""cocky"". He first served in the Military before becoming a Met Police officer from August 2001. Eight years later, a domestic abuse complaint was made against him but no further action was taken. The woman who made the allegation is one of the 12 victims. In 2019, Carrick was accused of assault and criminal damage but again, no action was taken. He was also cleared to return to work just weeks after first being accused of rape. The predator was not even subjected to a fresh round of vetting as a result of the July 2021 rape allegation. And he passed vetting back in 2001 despite being accused of burglary and malicious communications when a relationship ended. The Met has now referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) and apologised for not stopping him sooner. The fiend was sacked last month with all forces now checking their officers against national police databases. In total, Carrick pleaded guilty to 49 offences against 12 women including 24 rapes between 2003 and 2020. He also admitted nine counts of sexual assault, three charges of coercive and controlling behaviour, two attempted rape, one count of indecent assault and three of false imprisonment. Carrick further pleaded guilty to five counts of assault by penetration, one count of attempted sexual assault by penetration and one of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent. He denied a count of rape in September 2020 relating to a 13th woman but the CPS decided it was not in the public interest to proceed to trial on that charge. Assistant Commander Barbara Gray, the Met's lead for Professionalism, said: ""It is nearly three weeks since David Carrick entered the last of his guilty pleas. ""In doing so, he admitted to the most appalling offences against women. ""I am truly sorry for the harm and devastation he has caused them. We let them down and we failed to identify a man in the ranks of the Metropolitan Police Service who carried out the most awful offences. ""He should not have been a police officer.""

Who is murderer Billy Dunlop and where is he now?,"JULIE HOGG was brutally murdered by Billy Dunlop in 1989. The case remained unsolved for 17 years, before being solved with his imprisonment in 2006. Here, we look at what happened, and how long he was sentenced for. Dunlop was a labourer from Stockton on Tees born in 1963. After a 15 year battle from his victim's family, he was eventually jailed for the murder of Julie Hogg in 2006, following two trials which failed to convict the killer. In 1999, while serving a sentence for a separate crime, Dunlop Bragged to a prison guard that he had murdered Julie - but wouldn't go to prison for it under UK's double jeopardy laws. He then served six years for perjury, before eventually being jailed in 2006 for Julie's murder following a landmark overturning of the law. Dunlop was caged for 17 years for the 1989 killing of 22-year-old pizza delivery woman, Julie Hogg. She was a single mum to three-year-old Kevin at the time of her murder. Following her disappearance in November of that year, police originally treated the case as a missing person's. However, double jeopardy laws in the UK were scrapped in 2005 following a number of campaigns, including that of Julie's mum - and also the family of murdered black teenager, Stephen Lawrence.  Dunlop was jailed for life the following year, after already serving a six year stretch for perjury. In 2019 Dunlop had a plea rejected to move to an open prison.
 He pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to Julie's murder, having admitted it to a prison guard some seven years earlier. It was the final victory in Julie's mum, Anne's campaign to overturn the 800-year-old double jeopardy law - which was also backed by The Sun on Sunday. Dunlop became the first person charged twice with the same offence after the 800-year-old double jeopardy laws were changed. Dunlop had previously been formally cleared of the murder after two juries failed to reach verdicts. He was then jailed for a separate crime, assault, and during this prison stretch ""bragged"" to a prison guard that he had indeed murdered Julie. Due to double jeopardy laws - which mean you cannot be charged twice for the same crime - Dunlop knew that he wouldn't face a murder sentence as he had already been cleared of murder after a jury failed to make a decision. He was jailed for life in 2006 with a minimum tariff of 17 years. In 2022, Dunlop was again refused a move to an open prison by the Ministry of Justice in interest of public protection. He remains in custody, but is eligible for parole in October 0223. We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team? Email us at tips@the-sun.co.uk or call 0207 782 4368.

"British Army soldier, 21, appears in court charged with placing fake BOMB at RAF base","A BRITISH Army soldier has appeared in court over a bomb hoax at an RAF base. Daniel Abed Khalife, 21, was also accused of eliciting information about forces personnel that could be ""useful"" to a terrorist. The full charges say he ""elicited"" personal information about soldiers from the Ministry of Defence's Joint Personnel Administration System. The information is claimed to be ""likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism."" The alleged terror offence is said to have been carried out on August 2 2021, while the bomb hoax is claimed to have occurred on January 2 this year. Khalife, from Beacon Barracks, Staffordshire, is accused of placing a device mad out of ""cannisters with wires"" at the base, with the intention of making other believe it was a bomb. He went missing from the barracks in January, before being arrested on January 26. He appeared in Westminster Magistrates' Court this morning, speaking only to confirm his name and date of birth, with his father watching from the public gallery. He gave no indication of any plea during the five-minute hearing. Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring remanded him in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on February 17, saying: ""You did not enter a plea. These matters are very serious. ""If you are convicted you are going to face a prison sentence in years not months.  ""Therefore this court's powers are insufficient.""

New evidence in Emma Pattison ‘double murder suicide’ as it emerges husband was in contact with cops days before deaths,"THE husband of a top private school headteacher found dead on college grounds was in contact with police just days earlier.  George Pattison held a shotgun licence and is understood to have killed his wife Emma and seven-year-old daughter Lettie before taking his own life at the weekend.  He alerted officers to a change of address after his family moved from Caterham, Surrey, to the grounds of Epsom College. Cops said this was ""routine"", but due to how recently the update was made, the incident has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).  The bodies of headmistress Emma, George and Lettie were discovered at around 1am on Sunday.

"Epsom College head Emma Pattison made ‘distress call’ to relative before being ‘shot dead with daughter, 7, by husband’","A TOP private school headteacher called a family member in distress hours before she was found dead, it is reported. Emma Pattison, head at the prestigious Epsom College, Surrey, was discovered next to her husband George and seven-year-old daughter Lettie at around 1am on Sunday. Earlier that evening, she made a phone call to a relative with concerns about her partner, according to the BBC. By the time they arrived at the house, which is surrounded by other properties occupied by college staff and is close to the prestigious school's rifle range, all three were dead.  Cops have not disclosed the cause of deaths but are confident no one else was involved in the ""isolated"" incident. They confirmed a firearm registered to George was found at the scene and they are treating the tragedy as a double murder and suicide. Detectives suspect George, 39, killed his wife Emma, 45, and little Lettie before taking his own life.  He is thought to have shot them dead then turned the same gun on himself.  The chartered accountant had a shotgun licence which had recently been updated.  He had been in contact with police only last week about his weapon to inform officers about a change of address. Cops said this was ""routine"", but due to how recently the update was made, the incident has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).

Nicola Bulley dive expert fears missing mum was ‘abducted’ and asks partner ‘if she had enemies or stalkers’,"A DIVE expert claims it is a ""possibility"" Nicola Bulley been abducted as her partner confirmed she had ""no enemies"". Nicola, 45, was last seen in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, at around 9.15am on January 27. Private divers from Specialist Group International (SGI) are today continuing their search of the river using Sonar. Founder Peter Faulding said if the team cannot find the mum-of-two today, his ""gut"" feeling is there may be other reasons for her disappearance. He revealed he had spoken to Nicola's partner Paul Ansell last night after yesterday's search offered no trace of the mum. Mr Faulding told Mail Online: ""I spoke to Paul last night and asked him if she had any enemies, any stalkers, the normal questions you would ask. And nothing, he said no.  ""And she was totally normal that day when she left, nothing out the ordinary."" The forensic expert also claimed there is a ""possibility"" Nicola could have been abducted. He believes the mum's phone, which was found on a bench after she vanished, could be a ""decoy"". Mr Faulding told BBC Breakfast today: “If Nicola is not in that stretch of river today my view is that there is a third party involved and this was a decoy placed by the river. “It could have been placed as a decoy, there is not enough CCTV to cover particular areas here. The police are working hard in the background to cover everything. “It’s so unusual, we’ve got no clear information to go on."" Lancashire Police said previously their “main working hypothesis” is that Nicola had “sadly fallen in the river”. Supt Sally Riley claimed there may have been an “issue” with dog Willow that led Nicola to the edge of the water. Police believed the mum could have placed her phone on the bench to retrieve the dog’s tennis ball when she potentially fell in. But Nicola’s sister Louise Cunningham has rubbished the hypothesis. She said over the weekend: ""Off the back of the latest police media update, please can I add there is no evidence whatsoever that she has gone into the river, it's just a theory. ""Everyone needs to keep an open mind as not all CCTV and leads have been investigated fully, the police confirmed the case is far from over."" Nicola has been described as white, 5ft 3ins tall with light-brown shoulder-length hair. She was last seen wearing an ankle-length black quilted gilet jacket with a black Engelbert Strauss waist-length coat underneath and black tight-fitting jeans. She had long green walking socks tucked into her jeans, ankle-length green Next wellies, a necklace and a pale blue Fitbit on. Nicola has an Essex accent and links to the Thornton-Cleveleys area near Blackpool. Anybody with information about where she might be is asked to call 101, quoting log 473 of January 27, or ring 999 for immediate sightings.

Horrified teachers heard gunshots and rushed to Emma Pattison’s house before she was found dead with husband & daughter,"HORRIFIED teachers rushed to a top headmistress' family home on school grounds after hearing gunshots.  The bodies of Emma Pattison, 45, her husband George, 39, and seven-year-old daughter Lettie Pattison were later discovered at the property at Epsom College, Surrey, in the early hours of Sunday.  Cops have not disclosed the cause of deaths but are confident no one else was involved in the ""isolated"" incident.  They are understood to be treating the tragedy as a double murder and suicide. Detectives suspect George, 39, killed his wife Emma, 45, and little Lettie before taking his own life last weekend. They were found at the house, which is surrounded by other properties occupied by workers and is close to the prestigious school's rifle range, shortly after 1am on February 5.  A flag flew at half mast yesterday while a forensic examination of the area was carried out.  The tragedy has shaken the community and devastated those that knew the ""lovely"" family. One former neighbour said: ""It is just shocking and unimaginable."" Chloe Rathbone, 27, a nursery worker who looked after Lettie, told The Times: ""I am utterly so heartbroken over this awful news. ""They were such a lovely family and Lettie was perfect in every way, everything you could have wished for in a little girl."" And John Wildgoose, a photographer who took the family's portrait last month for the school's announcement of Emma's headship, described the youngster as ""an absolute angel"". He added: ""To me there was an obvious bond within the family, they seemed very together and excited about their future."" Emma became the first female head of £42,000-a-year Epsom College in September last year after six years at Croydon High School in South London. She lived on-site with her daughter, Labrador puppy Bella and chartered accountant husband George, who ran a management consultancy firm called Tanglewood 2016, according to Companies House.

Removal vans were spotted outside the four-bedroom detached home, where they had lived since 2014, in the last few weeks. Before Christmas, Emma seemed enthusiastic about her future at the elite school, which counts presenter Jeremy Vine and ex-MI6 spy chief Sir John Scarlett as ex-pupils.  But in a student-run podcast, she described the the transition period as being full of ""really big changes"". She said: ""We've obviously moved house, we've bought a dog, I've got a new job, my husband's got a new job which wasn't meant to happen but did, and my daughter has started a new school. ""There has been a lot of change for us as a family, but it has been wonderful."" She also expressed her passion for teaching and excitedly revealed how much she had loved her first few weeks at the helm and that ""there is so much to come"". Former colleagues and friends described Emma as a ""wonderful"" teacher who ""enriched children's lives"". Cheryl Giovannoni, chief executive of the Girls' Day School Trust (GDST), of which Croydon High School is part, said: ""Emma was a much loved and respected member of the GDST community, as well as a talented head and teacher and a dear friend to many of us. ""She touched the lives of all of us with her energy, wisdom and kindness during her six years as head of Croydon High School and the school will always bear the legacy of her inspiring leadership."" Dr Alastair Wells, chairman of the board of governors at Epsom College, said: ""I want to convey our utter shock and disbelief at this tragic news. ""Our immediate thoughts and condolences are with Emma's family, friends and loved ones, and to the many pupils and colleagues whose lives she enriched throughout her distinguished career. ""Emma was a wonderful teacher, but most of all she was a delightful person."" Epsom College, part of which remains cordoned off, won the top prize at the Independent Schools of the Year Awards 2022, with judges calling it a ""beacon of excellence"". The school was also named the winner of the Student Wellbeing Award at the October ceremony thanks to its ""whole-school approach to mental health and the wellbeing of both its staff and pupils"". More than 850 boys and girls attend the school, which was founded in 1853, and its acting head has been listed as Paul Williams. Ex-pupils include BBC presenter Jeremy Vine and ex-MI6 spy chief Sir John Scarlett.  ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21301490/epsom-college-teachers-emma-pattison-gunshots/
What happened to the rest of the Bethnal Green trio who joined ISIS with Shamima Begum?,"SHAMIMA BEGUM leaving the UK to go to Syria and become an ISIS bride is well documented. What isn't as well known is what happened to the two other girls who left with her in 2015. Shamima Begum was just 14 when she left her family home in Bethnal Green with two friends and fled to Syria. She caused controversy after she gave an interview with a Times journalist who found her in a refugee camp after she and her husband were caught by the Kurds. Begum told the journalist that she didn't regret joining the murderous cult but was desperate to return home and have her baby with the support of the NHS. She was married to Dutch Islamist fighter Yago Riedijk. The mum of three from East London moaned last year how she missed fish and chips and the NHS. Shamima's brazen lack of remorse sparked fury as she said the Manchester Arena suicide bombing was justified and claimed she deserves more sympathy. Amira Abase left the UK when she was just 15 to become an ISIS bride. Her dad called for her to be allowed back because she made a ""mistake"" in 2019. Hussen Abase hasn't seen or spoken to his daughter since she left in 2015 but still believes that she is alive. He blamed ISIS's social media propaganda for ""tricking"" the girls to go to Syria, telling Sky News in 2019: ""Teenagers don’t contemplate things, they can be easily tricked, they should be forgiven.” His comments come despite not hearing from his daughter as Amira is unaccounted for after recent bombing in Baghouz, eastern Syria.
 It is believed that Kadiza Sultana was killed in a 2017 airstrike after she fled the country with her pals. Her family, who had been in contact with her over the phone told ITV News that she was killed in a Russian bomb strike in Raqqa in May. She was just 16 when she flew to Istanbul and travelled to the Syrian boarder. We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

Shocking moment furious CEX shopper smashes phone in heated row with staff before blasting store a ‘f***ing rip off’,"SHOPPERS have been left stunned after a CEX customer smashed a phone in a raging row with staff. A clip posted to TikTok showed the man stamp on the device before smashing it over the corner of the counter before slamming the shop as a ""f***ing rip-off"". The fuming customer also accused staff of selling him ""f***ing s*** that you can't do anything with"" and called the phone a ""piece of f***ing s****"". He even hit the silver iPhone so hard on the counter that his watch fell off his wrist and onto the floor. Shocked shoppers queued in silence behind him as the outburst unfolded. The user who posted the video to social media, Shanice Ealson, 29, captioned it: ""Didn't expect this."" Care worker Shanice later said that she had gone into the shop in Weymouth, Dorset, to buy a video game and was shocked by what unfolded. After breaking the phone beyond repair and picking up his watch, the man turned to storm out of the shop. Commenters were quick to poke fun at the situation. One joked: ""Guy broke his watch before he broke the phone."" Another quipped: ""Thank god it wasn't a Nokia, the video would never end."" A third wrote: ""Damn now he's out of a watch and a phone."" Others, meanwhile, defended the shop and praised the staff for how they handled the situation. One supporter said: ""They don't make the prices, why are people always so mad at the employees?"" Some viewers were even CEX staff themselves and revealed that similar ordeals are a pretty regularly occurrence. One user even recalled having a laptop thrown at them when a customer ""didn't get their way"", while another added ""trust me this happens more often than you think"".

Who is Sean Mercer’s mother Janette?,"THE senseless killing of 11 year old Rhys Jones in 2007 shocked the nation. The mother of Jones' killer, Sean Mercer, was jailed for her part in covering up the crime. Here's what we know about her. Janette Mercer is the mother of Sean Mercer,  the teen gang member who murdered Rhys as he walked home in Liverpool. A Sun investigation revealed she worked as a prostitute during her son Sean’s trial, selling sex on at least two occasions. Janette worked at a brothel called Elegant Ladies in November 2008 where she offered sex to a reporter for £50 “all in”. She was one of several other people jailed after her son’s trial when she was found guilty of helping him. Janette Mercer got three years in prison for hiding her gunman son, telling cops a ""pack of lies"" to protect him from the law. She lied for over a year about the getaway bike used by her son after he shot dead the 11-year-old schoolboy. Jailing her in 2009, Judge Globe QC said: ""You backed up your son and told more lies."" The sex worker cut a shambolic figure in court – laughing one minute before breaking down in tears the next – while Rhys's parents Stephen and Melanie Jones remained calm and dignified. Several others were also convicted of helping Mercer, including other gang members and their parents. James Yates, now 29, and Dean Kelly, now 26 – who escaped conviction earlier this year for peddling heroin in Dundee – were jailed after supplying the firearm and helping to hide Mercer when he was on the run after the killing. And Yates’ mum Marie and her husband Frank were jailed for 18 months after admitting perverting justice and burning evidence. Marie got three further years for helping Mercer with a false alibi. Her gangster son James was jailed for seven years. Rhys’ dad Stephen said later: ""In our eyes they have always been as guilty as their sons. ""For us, no prison sentence for these people would be long enough."" Janette was released from jail in 2012. On August 22 2017, the tenth anniversary of Rhys' death, Mercer was pictured keeping a low profile as she moved bags from a car in Liverpool. In 2023, Mercer was jailed for nine months for lying to police about hiding her drug dealer son Joseph Mercer. She pleaded guilty to assisting an offender. Her lawyer, Clare Ashcroft, Said at Liverpool crown court in  that her client had told her: ""There were times when the police spoke to her and she felt she couldn't tell Joseph because she was frightened of his reaction."" She also suggested that Mercer implored her son to hand himself into the police. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3317945/janette-mercer-sean-mercer-rhys-jones-murderer/
I’m a taxi driver who handed back £570 I found in my car – but my reward blew my mind,"A TAXI driver never could have expected that when he returned a large wad of cash to its rightful owner that he would scoop a far bigger award. Isaac Ackon, who returned the cash worth £570 (GH₵8,400) to a passenger who left it in his car, is being praised across Ghana for his honesty. In an interview with a local radio station, Ackon said it was very easy for him to decide to return to the money.  ""I saw the money in my car after closing down from work but after consulting my wife briefly about it, I decided to return to cash. ""The simple reason is that I don't take things that are not mine,"" he said.  When he found the money, Ackon was struggling to feed his family on his taxi driver salary, whilst his car was becoming old and difficult to use, BBC Pidgin reported. Yet, the father-of-three didn't keep the money for himself but quickly set off to find to his former passenger - a local fishmonger called Teshie.  She cried with joy that she had her money back, wailing and almost crying in relief as she hugged him.  In the video that captured the beautiful moment, you can hear Teshie repeatedly thanking Ackon and saying ""God bless you"". The women's shocked neighbours are seen crowding around the driver to thank him for his honest actions.  ""We thank you, God,"" one woman said.  Another added: ""We haven’t slept all night. We are grateful you returned it, Sir. Thank you very much."" Ackon's heart-warming story only came to light when journalist, Manasseh Azure, began a fundraiser to reward his selfless act. The fundraiser quickly started garnering attention, with politicians and musicians rushing to support the cabbie.  Ghana's Vice President, Mahamudu Bawumia, gave Ackon the large cash sum of £1355 (GH₵20,000), whilst musician KiDi rewarded him with £340 (GH₵5,000) for his kindness.  Contributions then followed from all over the place by people inspired by the story.  In his seven years as a taxi driver, Ackon has returned a lot of lost items, including five mobile phones.  He claims he owes his actions to his Christian values and understanding the importance that item or money has to its owner.

Pregnant woman gives birth in earthquake rubble in Syria as newborn baby is pulled alive after a day trapped in wreckage,"A MIRACLE baby born under the earthquake rubble in Syria was rescued just minutes after entering the world.  The tot was pulled to safety after her courageous mother delivered the little girl under the weight of the wreckages of toppled buildings. The pregnant woman is believed to have been trapped under the debris for over a day in the northeastern town of Jenderes. She reportedly sadly died shortly after giving birth to the child surrounded by the devastation of Turkey's terrifying earthquakes.  Harrowing footage captured the moment one eagle-eyed rescuer plucked the infant from under the rubble.  The man was forced to navigate through the maze of twisted metal, crumbled concrete and barbed wire with the newborn in his arms.  He carried the little girl to safety as she took her first breaths, while another man races after him with a dusty green blanket. The comforter was hastily chucked towards the bloke so he could bundle the baby up to keep her warm and alive. Bystanders were seen watching the emotive rescue in awe, bemused by the wonder of new life in the depths of destruction. The tot is now being cared for, but her parents were reportedly tragically killed in the deadly earthquake. It is understood that the mum had been displaced from Syria's Deir Ezzor region by the brutal war, before heading to Jenderes some seven hours away.  Social media users suspected the video was filmed in a rural area close to the city of Aleppo, Syria's former commercial hub - which the earthquake wreaked havoc on. The baby's rescue has become a symbol of hope as aid teams, emergency services and locals race against the clock to find survivors.  At least 1,602 people have been killed in Syria and another 3,500 injured after the 7.8-magnitude earthquake rocked Turkey on Monday.  Northern regions were ravaged by the double shocks, as buildings violently shook from side to side.  Buildings already damaged by years of civil war collapsed in areas that are home to millions of refugees. The World Health Organisation's senior emergency officer Adelheid Marschang warned Syria's humanitarian needs demand a stronger response to the crisis.  Trauma and emergency surgical kits are among the supplies being dispatched to deal with casualties in the war-torn nation that is battling a recent cholera outbreak.  Ms Marschang said: ""This is a crisis on top of multiple crises in the affected region. ""All over Syria, the needs are the highest after nearly 12 years of protracted, complex crisis, while humanitarian funding continues to decline."" The WHO warned the total death toll of earthquake victims could rocket to more than 20,000 in the coming days. Homes and hospitals have already been devastated by aerial bombardments over the last decade.  The United Nations have warned aid efforts will hampered due to the harsh winter weather, damage to roads and fuel shortages. The organisation said 70 per cent of Syria's population required help, even before the earthquakes struck.  At least 20 detainees at a Syrian prison - believed to be jihadists - escaped after the tremors damaged the jail, AFP reports.  Inmates are said to have ""started to mutiny"" before taking control of the prison in the town of Rajo near the Turkish border.  The facility holds about 2,000 inmates, with about 1,300 of them suspected to be IS fighters, said an official at the jail. After the shudders - some of the biggest for 100 years - reigned terror on Turkey, the nation's death toll has risen to at least 3,419, vice-president Fuat Oktay said. Ex-Chelsea player Christian Atsu was found alive after being buried underneath the rubble until rescuers reportedly heard his voice.  The Sun has launched an urgent Earthquake Appeal to help the response to the destruction and loss of life in Turkey and Syria.

Chilling moment shark spotted stalking swimmers just yards from busy beach as people scream and flee from water,"TERRIFYING footage showed the moment a massive shark stalked a group of unsuspecting swimmers at a busy beach. Captured in Dongara, Western Australia, a beach goer shared the video of the frightening silhouette inching towards the oblivious swimmers just metres away from where they were located. The shark was spotted in swallow water at Grannies Beach in Port Denison. Panicked witnesses can be heard in the footage, screaming “shark!” and “get out of the water” and the startled bathers are then seen scrambling out. One boy joked: “You’re dinner”, and can be heard laughing in the clip. Beachgoers in the Donagara area are now worried about the safety of the waters and have expressed their concerns for those who regularly swim there.  “Can anyone confirm if there is a shark net at Donagara? If not this is stupidity and luck at its best,” video uploader Rob Paxevanos said. “There is a big tiger that comes in there on a regular basis. See it all the time,” one Facebook user commented under the video. ""It's only a tiger shark he was just cruising around,"" another said. The shark’s species is yet to be identified but experts have said that the size, shape and fin of the mammal could suggest that it is a Great White Shark. It is not uncommon for this dangerous predator to be sighted in waters off Western Australia and many people have jumped to the Great White’s defence. One Facebook user wrote: “Probably happens more than we know just happened to be caught on camera” Another commented: “It’s the risk we take when we enter their ocean.” Following a recent string of shark sightings in the area, local authorities have advised the public to be cautious of their surroundings before swimming in the ocean. This comes after we reported how Stella Berry, 16, was killed in a shark attack in North Fremantle, Australia on Saturday. After jumping into the Swan River to swim with a dolphin she was fatally attacked by a bull shark in front of her friends.  Stella suffered critical injuries after the shark latched onto her leg, and tragically died on the scene. Fremantle District Acting Inspector Paul Robinson said: ""It’s an extremely traumatic event for everyone involved and obviously, anyone that knew the young girl."" Robinson added it was ""unusual"" for a shark to be so far down river, which flows from Perth into the Indian Ocean.  The teenager’s parents Sophie and Matt Berry issued three photos of their daughter and appealed for “space and time we need to grieve our darling girl”. “We are devastated and deeply shocked by the loss of our beautiful daughter Stella,” they said in the statement. “We want to acknowledge the amazing support we have received from our family, friends, authorities and the WA community.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21300878/chilling-shark-stalking-swimmers-beach-scream/
Rarest 50p coin in circulation worth £280 revealed – could your change be worth a fortune?,"CHECK your pockets for the rarest 50p coin in circulation, which could sell for £280. The 50p Kew Gardens coin features the Chinese Pagoda at the famous London landmark of the same name. It makes it into the top three of the rarest coins out there as there are so few of them. Just 210,000 were released into circulation in 2009. It's also one of the most valuable due to its recognisable design and low mintage. On average, it sells for as much as £280 online. The coin is no stranger to even higher bids though, as at The Sun previously spotted the Kew Gardens 50p selling for as much as £580. And one eBay bidder paid £895 for an authentic copy of the Kew Gardens 50p. There are two main ways you can sell rare coins - through eBay or at auction. If you want to sell the coin you’ve found in your spare change on eBay then you need to know the risks. Remember to set a minimum price that is higher or at the very least equal to the face value of the coin. Even if your coin “sells” on eBay for a high price there’s no guarantee that the buyer will cough out. In its terms and conditions, the auction website states that bidders enter a “legally binding contract to purchase an item”, but there’s no way to enforce this rule in reality. The most eBay can do is add a note to their account of the unpaid item or remove their ability to bid and buy. This is because in order to sign up to the website users do not need to put in valid bank or PayPal details before making a bid. If a bidder refuses to pay, then the only option for sellers is to give “second chance offers” to other bidders or re-list the item. For items of a high value eBay recommends that sellers put a limit on their listing to approve bidders. It means bidders must email you before placing a bid but not that they must pay out the cash if they win. If you’ve got a coin that you would like to sell at auction then you can contact a member of the British Numismatic Trade Association. They usually deal in very old coins but they may be able to help you assess whether it’s worth selling your coin at auction or whether it would be valuable to collector. They'll usually charge you a fee for the service or take a percentage of the sale money. You’ll often have to visit them in person with the coin in order for them to assess it. Helpfully you can sort the members according the county where they are based. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/21302845/rarest-coin-circulation-fortune-change/
Tesco has made a big change to loo roll – and customers are not happy,"TESCO shoppers claim they are getting a bum deal after the supermarket giant made a major change to its toilet rolls. Customers have described some packs of Tesco Luxury Soft Toilet Tissue to be “wafer thin” and like “sandpaper” since the change.  In a bid to help the environment, Tesco is now wrapping standard length rolls of toilet paper more tightly onto the cardboard inner tubes. Tesco is selling the bathroom essential labelled as lasting longer and with 50% more sheets per roll. But some say the new design has thinned out the paper and left their ""delicate places irritated”.  Ranting on Tesco’s website, one chafed off shopper said: “What used to be lovely soft toilet paper is not. It’s cheap, nasty, it’s not soft at all and now irritates my delicate places.” Giving a one-star review, another added: “Tesco has gone to great lengths to announce there are now ’50% more sheets per roll’ but what they've failed to tell us is that this toilet paper is now so incredibly THIN you need to use a lot more of it on each loo visit!""  They added: ""Tesco, it's insulting that you think we wouldn't notice this!” A third wrote: “Feels like sandpaper compared to other supermarket own brands, definitely won’t be buying again.” And a fourth ranted: “This was soft once upon a time but the rolls I bought recently remind me of sandpaper.” Others have complained about the issue on social media.  One customer tweeted: “Tesco your Luxury Soft toilet paper is about as soft as 1000 grit sand paper... Sure it would polish my arse, but it certainly isn’t comfortable."" The new method of winding rolls more tightly has led to Tesco switching its standard 24 packs of toilet paper for packs of 12 ""double"" rolls.  Nine-packs of Luxury Soft Toilet Tissue have been ditched and the supermarket is now selling a six-pack of ""double"" rolls instead.  Tesco’s website states: “50% more sheets per roll, lasts longer than a standard roll.” Its four packs of standard rolls have not been affected by the change.  Tesco declined to comment. However, Katie Frost, Tesco’s buying manager for paper, previously said in a statement: “As well as removing unnecessary plastic, reducing the size of multipacks will free up valuable space in our lorries. “We are looking at a number of ways to use less packaging as a part of our 4Rs packaging strategy.  “In the last few years, we have cut six thousand tonnes of packaging from products, including a billion pieces of plastic."" Tesco isn't the only supermarket that's left shoppers feeling flushed. Lidl has changed the ply of its Florayl toilet paper - but the price has stayed the same. Meanwhile, we tested supermarket own-brand loo roll and the winner was stronger, thicker and softer than Andrex. Do you have a money problem that needs sorting?

Mortgage rates fall below 4% for first time in five months – full list of major banks slashing deals now,"MORTGAGE rates have fallen below 4% for the first time in five months. Lenders are battling it out to offer households the best mortgage deals in months, even as interest rates have risen. The Bank of England hiked its base rate for the tenth time in a row to 4% in January in a bid to tackle inflation. It now expects it to peak at 4.5% before falling to 3.25% over the next three years. The base rate is used by lenders to price the rates offered to customers on savings and loans including mortgages.  Usually, a rise in the base rate is passed on to consumers, but banks are dropping interest rates instead. This is because the Bank of England has lowered its forecasts on how interest rates will peak from 6% to 4.5% since the disastrous mini-Budget which caused mortgage rates to shoot up to a 14-year high. HSBC has announced that it is offering those remortgaging a five-year fixed deal at 3.99% to 60% LTV with a £999 fee. It comes only days after Lloyds Bank and Virgin Money slashed their 10-year mortgage to 3.99%. This is good news for home buyers and mortgage holders looking to refinance. The average two and five-year fixed rates fell month-on-month for the third month running, down to 5.42% and 5.14% respectively - down from 5.79% and 5.63% respectively last month. Keep in mind that the exact mortgage rate you can get depends on your personal financial circumstances. Rachel Springall, finance expert at MoneyFacts said: ""It’s encouraging to see fixed mortgage rates coming down for borrowers looking to secure a new deal. ""A five-year fixed rate mortgage is a great choice for those looking for peace of mind to fix their monthly repayments. ""Due to the unpredictable nature of the mortgage arena, it is imperative that both those looking to purchase a property or who wish to refinance seek independent advice from a broker to navigate the options available to them.” The news comes as more than 1.4million mortgage holders face new bill hikes of around £250 a month. The majority of fixed-rate mortgages in the UK (57%) which are coming up for renewal in 2023 were fixed at interest rates below 2%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). But the Bank of England has been forced to raise interest rates in a bid to tackle inflation. The base rate is now at its highest level seen since October 2008, when it stood at 4.5%. Borrowers on fixed-rate mortgages have been cushioned from the immediate impact so far.  But, they'll get a shock when they come to renew as average fixed rates are more than double what they were two years ago. This resulted from the previous government's disastrous mini-Budget which caused mortgage rates to shoot up to a 14-year high in September. The Bank of England expects mortgage rates to fall back to 3.25% in three years' time - bringing a new sigh of relief for mortgage holders and paving way for lenders to cut mortgage deals. If you have a fixed rate, you could see higher rates when you come to the end of the current term. Around 2.2million borrowers are due to come to the end of a deal that they fixed when the base rate was at a historic low of 0.1%. But if you're nearing the end of a fixed deal soon, you may be wondering if it's worth looking for another one now. David Hollingworth of broker L&C Mortgages said: ""Although those coming to the end of a fixed rate taken during the low in rates of recent years, will still be faced with higher payments than they have been used to, it’s a far cry from the prospect of rates at 6% or more. ""Those borrowers that understandably decided to sit on their hands when rates went through the roof last October, should now seriously consider if it’s time to take advantage of these significant improvements."" Getting the best rate on your mortgage can depend on the rates available at the time, but there are several ways to land the best deal. Usually the larger the deposit you have the lower the rate you can get. If you're remortgaging and your loan-to-value ratio has changed this could also give you access to better rates than before. A change to your credit score or a better salary could also help you access better rates. If you have a fixed rate, you could see higher rates when you come to the end of the current term after the BoE rise., either when shopping for a new fixed deal or reverting to the standard variable rate (SVR). But if you're nearing the end of a fixed deal soon it's worth looking now. You can lock in current deals sometimes up to six months before your current deal ends. Fixed rates have historically been cheaper than SVRs, but that may not be the case now, so its worth comparing the costs, and how long you want to be locked in for. Leaving a fixed deal early will usually come with an early exit fee, so you want to avoid this extra cost. But depending on the cost and how much you could save by switching versus sticking, it could be worth paying to leave the deal - but compare the costs first. To find the best deal use a mortgage comparison tool to see what's available. You can also got to a mortgage broker who can compare for you, but you may have to pay for this service. It could cost a couple of hundred pounds but it might save you thousands on you mortgage overall. You'll also need to factor in fees for the mortgage, though some have no fees at all, or you can add it on to the cost of the mortgage, but beware that means you'll pay interest on it and so will cost more in the long term. You can use a mortgage calculator to see how much you could borrow. Remember, that you'll have to pass the lender's strict eligibility criteria too, which will include affordability checks, and looking at your credit file. You may also need to provide documents such as utility bills, proof of benefits, your last three month's payslips, passports and bank statement.

Kids know more about tech than their parents do – and many don’t even recognise popular apps,"PARENTS believe their children become more tech-savvy than them at the age of 12, according to research. A poll of 2,000 mums and dads of children aged 18 and under found 47 per cent admit their child knows more than them when it comes to digital technology – resulting in 59 per cent wishing they were more ‘digitally savvy’. It emerged 15 per cent have previously been outwitted by their offspring as they successfully disabled the safety settings originally put in place. While just 13 per cent feel fully confident in navigating parental control features - with social media, video sharing platforms, and messaging apps being the biggest concerns in regard to their child’s safety. When it comes to language, ‘Face Card’, ‘OOMF’ and ‘GRWM’ are just some of the modern-day digital terms 66 per cent have never heard of. And while 28 per cent know what Discord is, just 11 per cent are familiar with BeReal – despite its recent popularity. The research was commissioned by Vodafone to mark the launch of its new parental controls and safety settings resource, Digital Parenting Pro, in line with Safer Internet Day taking place today. Nicki Lyons, corporate affairs and sustainability officer at Vodafone UK, said: “When it comes to tech, any parent or carer knows what it feels like when your kids know more than you. “This is why we've created Digital Parenting Pro to help adults easily understand what safety controls do or don’t exist on the latest games or social platforms, what age they are recommended for and what safety features there are. “We understand just how fast things move and our latest resource should give parents confidence when navigating the digital world.” With 85 per cent allowing their kids to access online content, digital safety came out as the top area parents feel most ill-equipped in. A third (33 per cent) would feel more at ease with their child using the internet if they were able to regularly supervise, and 27 per cent would feel this if they had a better understanding of how to keep them safe. With a further 32 per cent feeling this way if they knew they had the correct parental controls in place. Despite the unfamiliarity when it comes to online safety settings, an encouraging 90 per cent of those polled via OnePoll would be confident talking to their son or daughter about online precautions. When it comes to being educated, 37 per cent would like to learn more about modern day phrases and language, while 35 per cent are keen to know more about the platforms their children use. Will Gardner, director of the UK Safer Internet Centre, said: “Safer Internet Day 2023 is about encouraging children and young people to talk about their lives online, as well as providing parents and carers with the information and tools to facilitate these important conversations that go beyond a single day. “It is great to see Vodafone actively supporting it with its new resource as it will help equip parents with the information they need to help support their children online.” Looking for tips and hacks for your phone?

Millions of Brits warned your bank’s app is not safe – see where yours ranks,"VIRGIN Money's online banking app has been voted as the least secure, according to a cyber investigation by Which? The demise of brick and mortar banks from high streets mean Brits are relying on their banking apps more than ever. More than 29,100 cases of remote banking fraud were reported to industry body UK Finance in the first half of 2022. These involved scammers breaking into consumers’ bank accounts via their internet, telephone or mobile banking and fleecing their accounts of hard earned cash. Consumer rights and advice organisation Which? tested the security of a raft of different banking apps, alongside cyber experts at Red Maple Technologies. The pair found that Virgin Money got the lowest total scores for its online banking portal and its app. Red Maple Technologies found six outdated Virgin Money web applications which had potential security holes. The bank has said three of these will be fixed in the coming weeks. Virgin Money did not properly block insecure passwords and remove phone numbers from notifications. There were also no security checks to pay someone new, change an email address or edit the details of a payee. Starling snagged the top spot for online banking security, as it properly authorises online logins and has instant alerts of any sensitive activity. Sam Richardson, Which? money deputy editor, said: “Banks should not be leaving these open doors for scammers to exploit and must up their game to protect their customers properly.  “By making improvements, such as blocking weak passwords, banks can take an important step in preventing unscrupulous fraudsters from attempting to steal money and personal data from consumers.” Where does my bank rank? A spokesperson from cybersecurity firm VPNOverview added that “Although banks around the world are working hard to make online banking as safe as possible, it is still a good idea to take some safety measures yourself when managing your finances. ""By taking charge of your own online safety, you can prove to your bank that you are not negligent and are more likely to be reimbursed by your bank if something bad happens."" How do I stay safe? Use a unique password, longer than six characters and with a variety of symbols. Make sure your banking login details are different from your other online portals or services. Do not give online banking login details to anyone. Use fingerprint and face ID, and other forms of two-factor authentication. Update apps, to make sure your apps and the device’s operating system are up-to-date and the most secure. If you receive an email or a text from a number or address you don’t recognise that contains a hyperlink, don’t click on it. Be wary of suspicious emails. Cybercriminals may send convincing-looking emails with a bank’s logo and a professional-looking layout. If this email asks for sensitive information, including your password, login details or PIN code, it is likely a ruse and should be deleted. Your bank will never ask for such details over email or phone. Looking for tips and hacks for your phone? Want to find those secret features within social media apps? We have you covered...

Alert for millions of WhatsApp users as 5 huge changes to app officially revealed,"WHATSAPP has rolled out a set of sparkly new features to its 2billion users across the globe today.  Meta, which owns WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram, has been busy introducing a new 'status' feature to its platforms over the past week.  Facebook has famously had the status feature since its inception.  But it has recently made its way onto Instagram, and today onto WhatsApp.  ""Status is a popular way to share ephemeral updates with friends and close contacts on WhatsApp,"" the company said in a blog post today.  ""They disappear in 24 hours and may include photos, videos, GIFs, text, and more.""  Users can select the audience for their status - which can be changed in their privacy settings.  Similar to Instagram's 'close friends' story feature, WhatsApp users can make their status public or viewable to only a select few. Unlike Instagram and Facebook, users will be able to have a voice status, allowing them to record and share voice messages up to 30 seconds long.  ""Voice status can be used for sending more personal updates, especially if you feel more comfortable expressing yourself by talking rather than typing,"" the company said.  WhatsApp has also listened to fans, and has allowed users to react to statuses.  ""This was the #1 feature users wanted, following the launch of reactions last year,"" the company explained.  Users can now quickly reply to any status by swiping up and tapping on one of eight emojis.  Another new WhatsApp feature which mirror's its sibling Instagram is status profile rings for new updates.  Users' profile pictures will be encircled with a green ring when there is a new status other users haven't seen yet.  Should users post a link on their status, a preview will automatically pop up like it does inside a chat.  ""Visual previews make your statuses look better, and also give your contacts a better idea of what the link is before they click,"" said WhatsApp.  ""Just like your personal chats and calls, your WhatsApp status is protected by end-to-end encryption so you can share privately and securely."" But users will have to first update their app before gaining access to the new features.  Looking for tips and hacks for your phone? Want to find those secret features within social media apps?

Next iPhone set for a huge new upgrade – but you may want to keep it a secret from friends,"YOUR next iPhone could have a huge new feature that'll make you popular with mates. However, you might want to keep quiet about it. Rumour has it, Apple is finally set to launch reverse wireless charging. It's a handy tool that allows you to charge another person's smartphone by giving them some of your iPhone's power. Just flip both devices back-to-back and it'll charge wirelessly. But obviously this means giving up some of your precious juice, so think twice about who you charge up - and whether you'll have enough left to get yourself through the day. According to 9to5Mac, Apple wanted to introduce the feature on the iPhone 14 but it wasn't quite ready. Now it looks like developers are trying to make it available on the iPhone 15. Other smartphone makers have had wireless charging on board for quite a while now. The option may come in useful for yourself too, as you can refuel other gadgets as well. This could be particularly helpful if your AirPods are low or down to zero. Apparently iPhones as far back as the iPhone 11 have had kit under the hood capable of doing wireless charging but it's not been activated. Engineers are reportedly working on a way for a handy animation and sound to play out whenever you wireless charge something from your iPhone. Of course, Apple is notoriously quiet about upcoming changes so we'll have to wait and see if it becomes a reality in the iPhone 15 or another future model. Looking for tips and hacks for your phone?

Google Chrome to become dangerous today – check your settings now,"A BRAND new Google Chrome update has been rolled out to web users today. But it means users must update their now-outdated version of Google Chrome, as it is likely hosting some security holes.  If internet users don't update their Chrome browser the latest version, they can leave themselves and their devices open to malware.  Malware is software that is designed to damage or gain unauthorised access to a device.  It can creep into a computer or smartphone via dodgy links and websites.  Google's Chrome will typically pick up on these dodgy sites, and alert users that ""the site ahead contains malware"" or that a site is ""suspicious"".  But each new version of Chrome will have patched up security flaws in the previous.  It makes it safer for users to explore online.  Chrome 110 is a big update for the web browser, as it is the first version that is not available for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 devices. Millions are still using these older versions of Windows.  But they will have to use Chrome 109, or upgrade their operating system to get a more secure web browser.  Any attempt to install the brand new Chrome 110 on these older systems will result in error messages. While not updating Chrome can leave a device open security gaps, Google has said it will provide Chrome 109 with critical security updates until October ""to ease customer transitions"". Google had previously released Chrome 110 to a handful of users in mid-January, as part of its Beta scheme.  ""By releasing stable to a small percentage of users early, we get a chance to monitor the release before it rolls out to all of our users,"" Google explained.

"Epsom College closes after murder of headmistress Emma Pattison, as cops probe ‘murder suicide’","EPSOM College has closed after the murder of the prestigious school’s headmistress. Emma Pattison was discovered dead next to her husband George and seven-year-old daughter Lettie at around 1am on Sunday. Detectives believe the dad shot his partner and daughter being turning the gun on himself. The chartered accountant held a shotgun licence, which had recently been updated, and a weapon registered in his name. Cops have not disclosed the cause of deaths but a firearm belonging to George was discovered at the family home with their bodies. Now the doors of the school have been shut to students because of the “incredibly distressing” incident, reports The Telegraph. In a letter to parents the acting head said families must “to come together and try to process this shocking news.” Paul Williams wrote: “The shock and horror of the past few days have been unprecedented. The impact on your children cannot be underestimated and we are doing everything we can to support them in whatever way they need. “On Monday, it was helpful to all come together as a community to receive and offer support. We have had a team of counsellors at the College available for all pupils and staff. “In addition to that, of course, we have all been here for anyone who is struggling and needs additional support. “However, the details that have emerged today are incredibly distressing and we feel it is best to close the College from this evening. Now is the time for families to come together and try to process this shocking news.” Day pupils finished this evening and will not return until half term. Meanwhile weekly students will be collected by parents tomorrow morning. However, full boarders are being allowed to stay until the scheduled start of the half term break on Friday. George is thought to have killed his family late on Saturday night. Earlier that evening, his wife made a distress call to a relative with concerns about her partner, the BBC reports. By the time they arrived at the house, which is surrounded by other properties occupied by college staff and is close to the prestigious school's rifle range, all three were dead. A school worker living nearby is believed to have raised the alarm after hearing suspected gunshots. Detective Chief Inspector Kimball Edey, senior investigating officer on the case, said: ""This is an incredibly traumatic incident and we are working around the clock to investigate and understand the exact circumstances which led to this point."" Emma was only appointed headmistress at the £42,000-a-year boarding school five months ago. She lived on-site with her daughter, Labrador puppy Bella and husband George, who ran a management consultancy firm called Tanglewood 2016, according to Companies House.

"Missing Nicola Bulley is unlikely to be found in river & for her to reach the sea is IMPOSSIBLE, claims dive squad head","THE head of a specialist dive squad searching for missing Nicola Bulley has claimed it is “impossible” that her body could have reached the sea. Specialist Group International (SGI) have been scouring ""large areas"" of water for the mum 11 days after she vanished. Lancashire Police said previously their “main working hypothesis” is that Nicola had “sadly fallen in the river”. Supt Sally Riley claimed there may have been an “issue” with dog Willow that led Nicola to the edge of the water. But extensive searches have been so far unsuccessful - and Peter Faulding of SGI believes it is ""ulikely"" she will be found there. And he claims there is “no way” she could have reached the sea. He told GB News: “We've been using the high frequency side scan sonar in this stretch today and it's so detailed I can even see every stone of it. She's not in this stretch. “We also sonar-ed on the other side down yesterday in the tidal river. Now if you take a football on a tidal river…when the tide goes out the the ball will go down the stream and then as soon as the tide turns it will come back in again. It'll end up back at the same place. “For Nicola to get out to the sea would be impossible, literally, it is such a long way.” Lancashire Police today confirmed they are keeping an ""open mind"" but said they still believe Nicola fell in the river. Supt Sally Riley said the force has not yet detected a ""suspicious"" element in Nicola's disappearance. She added: ""Every third party element or criminal element has been looked into and discounted."" In a press conference today, the officer also warned amateur detectives from trespassing in empty properties as the search reaches its 11 day. And she urged the public not to ""take matters into their own hands"" and refrain from speculating online as it could ""hurt"" Nicola's family. Supt Riley added: ""Nor is it helpful if people, particularly if they have come from outside of the area, take it upon themselves to take the law into their own hands by trying to, for example, break into empty property. ""They may mean well, they may want to help. But they can help in thinking back if they were in the area to what information they may have of relevance to the police and holding the family in their thoughts. ""But we will not tolerate online abuse of anyone, including innocent witnesses, members of the family and friends, of local businesses, or of criminal damage or burglary. We will be taking a strong line on that, as you would expect."" Supt Sally Riley also explained the details surrounding the mammoth inquiry. She said there are 500 ""active"" pieces of information and lines of inquiry police are investigating - but ""nothing of note"" has been found yet. Officers are speaking to the drivers of 700 vehicles that drove through the village at around 9.10am/9.15am on the morning Nicola vanished. Supt Riley said the search is ""complex"" as the river can be fast-moving with parts of the water tidal. She added: ""It remains our belief that Nicola fell into the river and that this is a missing person inquiry. ""We are fully open minded to any information that indicates where Nicola is and what happened to her."" ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21309303/missing-nicola-bulley-impossible-sea/
Nicola Bulley’s friends beg cops to explore ‘other avenues’ if they don’t find missing mum in river,"PALS of missing mum Nicola Bulley are begging police to “explore other avenues” in their investigation. The dog walker, 45, disappeared after dropping her children off at school in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, on Friday January 27. Since then there has been no trace of the mum-of-two, leaving her family in agony. Lancashire Police believe Nicola, 45, fell into the river while walking her dog in St Michael's on Wyre. Specialist Group International (SGI) today again searched the water for the mum eleven days after she vanished. But family and friends of Nicola have questioned the police theory that she is in the water. Today Heather Gibbons spoke on the banks of the River Wyre while, below her, Peter Faulding and his team used a sonar to scan the depths. She said: ""As family and friends, the way we are looking at it is, between Peter and his team and the police, we feel we have got the best of the best on that water and hopefully it will be a completion, one way or the other. ""And if they find nothing, then maybe its time to start looking down other avenues."" Earlier Mr Faulding told Good Morning Britain detectives investigating the disappearance ""have got nothing to go on"". He added: ""I personally think, if I rule this stretch of water our where we are working today, I don't think she is here. ""I think there's probably a third party involved."" Today Mr Faulding and his team made repeated sweeps up and down a section of the river using sonar equipment. They were concentrating on an area around and downstream from a bench where Ms Bulley's mobile phone was left, still connected to a work call. The lead to her springer spaniel dog, Willow, and its harness, were also left at the bench. Police divers have previously searched the same area last week amid a huge ongoing hunt for mortgage adviser Ms Bulley, who lived in the village of Inskip, two miles from the river. Police say they have ruled out Ms Bulley leaving that area of the river and suspect she may have gone into the water after an ""issue"" with the dog while walking. After spending Monday searching ""three or four miles"" of the river until it grew dark alongside Lancashire Police, Mr Faulding said: ""It's a negative search, no signs of Nicola.""

Inside family of Rhys Jones killer Sean Mercer from ties to UK’s Pablo Escobar to sex worker mum & drug dealer brother,"THE callous killer of schoolboy Rhys Jones belongs to a notorious crime family with links to a drugs kingpin once dubbed the UK’s Pablo Escobar. Sean Mercer was just 16 when he gunned down 11-year-old Rhys by accident during a gangland feud on the streets of Liverpool. He was jailed for life with a minimum of 22 years for the horrific crime that shocked the nation. Mercer opened fire at rival gang members , firing shots across a pub car park. Rhys, on his way home from playing football, was hit in the neck and died.  The crime was met with widespread revulsion and led to a massive police manhunt for the killer. Mr Justice Irwin, who jailed Mercer, told the teenager that he was a shallow criminal. He said: ""This offence arose from the stupid, brutal gang conflict which has struck this part of Liverpool. You were caught up in that from a young age, but it is clear you gloried in it. ""It is wrong to let anyone glorify or romanticise this kind of gang conflict. You are not soldiers.You have no discipline, no training, no honour. You do not command respect. You may think you do, but that is because you cannot tell the difference between respect and fear.  ""You are selfish, shallow criminals, remarkable only by the danger you pose to others."" Sean's mum Janette has now begun a nine month prison sentence. On Monday Liverpool Crown Court heard how Janette, 63, who pleaded guilty to assisting an offender, let her son Joseph live with her while he was wanted by police in relation to drug dealing on the south coast. Jailing Mercer, Judge David Potter told how Joseph had bullied her in her own home. He said that she lied to police because she was scared of what Joseph might do. Joseph Mercer had returned to his mum's house after he served out a 30 month sentence for drug offences. The Mercer family were already notorious across Merseyside , mainly due to Sean's 2008 conviction for murderingschoolboy Rhys Jones. Sean , a teenage member of the city's Croxteth Crew gang, was aiming for members of a rival gang from Norris Green when he shot 11-year-old Rhys by accident. After the murder Janette lied to police to try and protect her son. Others within the family's inner circle also closed ranks to try and protect Sean. Jailing her for three years in 2009, Judge Globe QC said: ""You backed up your son and told more lies."" An investigation by The Sun revealed that Mercer had worked as a prostitute in a brothel during her son's murder trial.Janette told an investigator working for the paper that she would have sex with him for £50. Sean Mercer's time behind bars has been littered with incidents. In 2009, just a year into his sentence, he stabbed a con with homemade knife. In 2012 steroids were found in his cell. In 2020 The Sun revealed he had been texting a girl on an illegal mobile while pushing for parole. Last year Mercer was arrested at HMP Gartree in relation to a plot to smuggle illegal mobiles into the jail. Joe McCormick, Mercer's father, was regularly seen at the 2009 murder trial wearing natty suits. The heavily built  Liverpool man  was already known in the city's tough door and security industry. Joe , who died in 2017, had become involved in an underworld dispute after an incident outside a Liverpool nightclub. In July 1996 Joe , who was on the door of the Venue nightclub in Tuebrook, claimed Philip Glennon Jnr had pulled out a gun and tried to shoot him.  Police then arrested Mr Glennon, which led to the involvement of Liverpool crime boss Curtis Warren. Warren made a number of phone calls to close associates in Liverpool, to try and get the charges dropped.Warren, who was based in Holland at the time,  was in a relationship with a member of the Glennon family and wanted to help. At the time Warren was at the centre of a massive police operation code named Crayfish, and his phone callswere being listened to by Dutch and British police. Transcripts of the phone calls were later produced at Warren's trial in Holland, when he was charged with drug offences.The transcripts revealed that at one point Warren made contact with Joe McCormick. Mr McCormick said to Warren: ""His argument was all over because he didn't want to pay the three quid, apparently.""He goes upstairs, smashes two bottles, so gets lashed out.I come round the corner, I'm in the office and see all the doormen spread out everywhere."" Warren replied by saying ""Joe, I'm not disputing anything you say mate.""  Warren paid money to corrupt police officer  DCI Elmore Davies to try and help undermine the prosecution. Gladiator telly star Mike Ahearne acted as a buffer between Warren and Davies. In 1998 Ahearne and Davies were both jailed for attempting to pervert the course of justice. Yesterday Mercer cried as she was about to be sent down by the judge.Clare Ashcroft, defending, said: “She is a lady of some notoriety and I accept on her behalf that the court will be concerned by the commission of this latest offence.” The transcripts referred to in this story were taken from Cocky by Tony Barnes, Richard Elias and Peter Walsh.

Britain’s richest gypsy Alfie Best is my boss and it’s not always easy… here’s what he’s REALLY like to work for,"ALFIE Best is Britain's richest gypsy with a net worth of £740MILLION. His astonishing wealth is fuelled by his residential park homes empire Wyldecrest Parks, which made £32MILLION in profits last year alone. And with a personalised £4.5million Aston Martin helicopter and his own football club making up his astonishing portfolio belt - the multimillionaire is no average boss. His staff told The Sun what it's REALLY like working for Alfie. While it isn't always ""easy"", working for him is never boring. Wyldcrest Parks' assistant director of planning John Preston said: ""I find that there's few dull moments. I've worked for Alfie for over for years now.  ""His background is very important. He's very rich, he's very clever - and he's got a gypsy background and is rightly proud of it.  ""Sometimes one or more of those factors mean people don't like him. ""I think maybe people who don't like him haven't actually met him.   ""He created a business which has gone from one caravan park to over 100. ""He's a workaholic without a doubt."" Meanwhile, 25-year-old Henry Grimble works at Wyldecrest Park's Lakeside site. The ""boots-on-the-ground"" worker - who moonlights as an MMA fighter - has recalled his experiences working for the gypsy mogul. He told The Sun: ""I've been developing the Lakeside site from the ground up.  ""It was a baron field before Alfie got to it."" He said working for Alfie is ""great"". ""It's very impressive how even though Alfie has so much on  - over 100 parks - and each of those parks could have ten or 15 queries he needs to deal with himself, he'll still find time to check in with me and see what I'm doing,"" Henry added. ""If there's a way he wants something to be done, he'll ask me to do it that way.  ""But if I think my idea is better, he has the lack of ego to say 'yeah that idea is better'. ""It's not what he says is law. That makes the jobs easier."" Wyldecrest Parks netted £32MILLION in profits last year alone - up from £29m last year. And if all goes to plan, Alfie himself will be crowned the world's first gypsy billionaire as early as next year. Sun reporter Jemma was offered a peek into a normal day in Alfie Best's high-flying life. The day began in his £6million Surrey mansion, where his well-heeled neighbours include an Arab sheikh and Queen rock star Brian May. Multimillionaire Alfie starts at 6am - with a simple cup of coffee before work kicks off bang on 7am. And his hustle doesn't stop, with Alfie working late into the night. Most baffling of all, he doesn't stop for breakfast, lunch nor dinner - only breaking his fast with a late-night meal before bed. He jets between parks on his personalised helicopter - designed by James Bond’s favourite car company, Aston Martin. In true Alfie form, he even crowned it with the registration G-YPSE which is emblazoned on the fuselage. But Alfie did not start off with millions. He was brought up on the living in a caravan on a lay-by with an outdoor camp fire as a stove. But his childhood was happy, he shares. Alfie's company now owns over 100 residential parks country-wide. The properties hit the market for as little as £15k. The millionaire's ethos is simple - he wants to offer affordable homes for as many people as he can. He says: ""What we do as a company is ground-breaking . What we're doing is creating better lives for people. Do we get it right all the time? No. ""Are we pleasing every one of our clients? No. ""But if I can please 90 per cent-plus then I'm happy with that. ""Park home living isn't for everybody. But I feel like I've been blessed with something that can genuinely change people's lives. And we are changing lives - 16,000 residents can't be wrong.""   ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21306102/britains-richest-gypsy-alfie-best-boss-work/
Timeline of Epsom College ‘double murder suicide’ revealed as cops say George Pattison spoke to cops days before killing,"POLICE believe a dad killed his wife and seven-year-old daughter in a double murder-suicide last weekend.  But what happened in the months leading up to the tragedy on the grounds of Epsom College, Surrey?  George Pattison reports his wife to the police for allegedly striking him. He is said to have contacted Surrey Police to say his partner had hit him and she was spoken to by officers. But he later withdrew the claim as he decided it was trivial, The Times reports. Emma became the first female head of £42,000-a-year Epsom College in September last year. Emma, who ditched a post-university graduate scheme at Thomas Cook for teaching, detailed her career in education, which began in 2002 at Lutterworth College, South Leicestershire, where she taught French and Spanish. She went on to have stints at Caterham School and Guildford High School, both in Surrey, before moving to St John's School, also in the county. Three years later, she became head at Croydon High School where she ""learnt so much"", then she relocated to Epsom last year to ""use that knowledge and skill and apply it to something different"". She moved on site with her daughter and George, who ran a management consultancy firm called Tanglewood 2016, according to Companies House. The family bought a new dog - a labrador named Bella. In a pupil-run podcast, Emma described the the transition period as being full of ""really big changes"". She told sixth form students: ""We've obviously moved house, we've bought a dog, I've got a new job, my husband's got a new job which wasn't meant to happen but did, and my daughter has started a new school. ""There has been a lot of change for us as a family, but it has been wonderful."" Emma says she hopes to shape a 'really exciting future' in a magazine interview published this month George alerted officers to a change of address after his family moved from Caterham, Surrey, to the grounds of Epsom College. Cops said this was ""routine"", but due to how recently the update was made, the incident has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). The bodies of Emma, George and Lettie are discovered at home at 1.10am. A source told The Telegraph a member of staff living nearby raised the alarm after hearing gunshots. The Pattison family home is understood to be surrounded by other properties occupied by teachers and school workers. A cordon is in place at the school while detectives scour the area Cops investigating the deaths are understood to be treating the tragedy as a double murder and suicide. Surrey Police said they are not looking for anybody else in connection with the ""isolated"" incident, but have given no further details of the causes of the deaths.

What happened to Nicola Bulley’s dog?,"A DOG expert has said missing mum Nicola Bulley's pet could be vital in helping to trace her. Colin Tennant, director of the Cambridge Institute of Dog Behaviour and Training, explained that pooches often return to the last spot that they were with their owner due to a strong sense of smell. He wrote in The Times that if a person had fallen into a river, as cops suspect Nicola, 45, may have done, then their dog would tend to pick up their scent and circulate the area. Nicola's springer spaniel Willow was found close to where her owner went missing The fact that the dog was dry has led to speculation that the mum-of-two did not fall into the river. However, a second canine behaviour expert, Ross McCarthy, told the Express: ""It all depends on the dog’s association with water and their relationship with the owner and so on, as to whether they would jump in. ""Dogs go into fight or flight as we do, but they may not perceive the same dangers as us. Often chemical changes in the body of the owner can alert the dog to an unusual situation but naturally if the owner is not present - that won't be the case. ""Presumably this dog has been walked along the canal and water often and been discouraged from going in or naturally just avoided going in. It would be a strange occurrence from the dog’s perspective - but outside of Disney and in exceptional cases - dogs don't jump in to save owners."" Mortgage advisor Nicola was walking Willow on a river path in St Michael's-on-Wyre, Lancashire, when she is believed to have fallen in. At the time of her disappearance, she was wearing a long black gilet jacket with a hood and had her hair tied in a ponytail. She had black jeans on with olive green ankle wellies. Nicola's phone and the dog's lead were found on a bench nearby. Nicola was reported missing on January 27, 2023. She was last seen at 9.10am that morning. Superintendent Sally Riley of Lancashire Police confirmed there is a ten minute window where they cannot account for Nicola's movements. This is between the last confirmed sighting at 9.10am, and 9.20am when Nicola's phone was connected to a work call on the bench. Nicola's parents Ernest and Dot Bulley have pleaded for anyone with information on their daughter's disappearance to come forward. Her partner, Paul Ansell, has openly spoken about the hell the family are going through. He told of how her two daughters broke down when he had to tell them ""mummy's lost"".

Nicola Bulley cops issue warning and remain ‘open minded’ after investigating every ‘third party or criminal element’,"POLICE searching for Nicola Bulley said they have probed ""every criminal element"" as they remain ""fully open minded"" over her disappearance. Nicola, 45, was last seen in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, at around 9.15am on January 27. Since then, there has been no trace of the mum with search efforts ramping up today. Lancashire Police today confirmed they are keeping an ""open mind"" but said they still believe Nicola fell in the river. Supt Sally Riley said the force has not yet detected a ""suspicious"" element in Nicola's disappearance. She added: ""Every third party element or criminal element has been looked into and discounted."" In a press conference today, the officer also warned amateur detectives from trespassing in empty properties as the search reaches its 11 day. And she urged the public not to ""take matters into their own hands"" and refrain from speculating online as it could ""hurt"" Nicola's family. Supt Riley added: ""Nor is it helpful if people, particularly if they have come from outside of the area, take it upon themselves to take the law into their own hands by trying to, for example, break into empty property. ""They may mean well, they may want to help. But they can help in thinking back if they were in the area to what information they may have of relevance to the police and holding the family in their thoughts. ""But we will not tolerate online abuse of anyone, including innocent witnesses, members of the family and friends, of local businesses, or of criminal damage or burglary. We will be taking a strong line on that, as you would expect."" Supt Sally Riley also explained the details surrounding the mammoth inquiry. She said there are 500 ""active"" pieces of information and lines of inquiry police are investigating - but ""nothing of note"" has been found yet. Officers are speaking to the drivers of 700 vehicles that drove through the village at around 9.10am/9.15am on the morning Nicola vanished. Supt Riley said the search is ""complex"" as the river can be fast-moving with parts of the water tidal. She added: ""It remains our belief that Nicola fell into the river and that this is a missing person inquiry. ""We are fully open minded to any information that indicates where Nicola is and what happened to her."" The update comes as private divers from Specialist Group International (SGI) continue their search of the river using sonar devices. Founder Peter Faulding said if the team cannot find the mum-of-two today, his ""gut"" feeling is there may be other reasons for her disappearance. The forensic expert also claimed there is a ""possibility"" Nicola could have been abducted. He believes the mum's phone, which was found on a bench after she vanished, could be a ""decoy"". Mr Faulding told BBC Breakfast today: “If Nicola is not in that stretch of river today my view is that there is a third party involved and this was a decoy placed by the river. “It could have been placed as a decoy, there is not enough CCTV to cover particular areas here. The police are working hard in the background to cover everything. “It’s so unusual, we’ve got no clear information to go on."" Lancashire Police said previously their “main working hypothesis” is that Nicola had “sadly fallen in the river”. Supt Sally Riley claimed there may have been an “issue” with dog Willow that led Nicola to the edge of the water. Officers yesterday revealed more about Nicola's final movements as they issued an update on her disappearance. They said she did not leave the field where she was walking Willow via Rowanwater, either through the site itself or via the piece of land at the side. Nicola also did not return to the fields along Allotment Lane or via the path at the rear of the Grapes pub onto Garstang Road. Officers are now focusing on a river path that leads from the fields back to Garstang Road and are appealing for drivers to come forward. Anyone who travelled down the road on that day will also receive a letter from police requesting dashcam footage. Officers previously released a timeline of the missing mum’s final movements before she disappeared. Nicola began her walk along the towpath to the River Wyre at 8.43am after dropping her two children off at school. Police say around seven minutes later, a dog walker who knows Nicola saw her walking around the lower field with her springer spaniel Willow. The witness said their two dogs interacted briefly before she left Nicola via the river path. At 8.53am, the mum sent an email to her boss at Exclusively Mortgages. She then logged into a Teams call at 9.01am and was seen around nine minutes later on the upper field walking Willow. Police say at 9.30am, the work call ended but Nicola stayed logged on. At around 9.35am, the mobile and Willow were found at a bench by the river but there was no sign of Nicola. Nicola has been described as white, 5ft 3ins tall with light-brown shoulder-length hair. She was last seen wearing an ankle-length black quilted gilet jacket with a black Engelbert Strauss waist-length coat underneath and black tight-fitting jeans. She had long green walking socks tucked into her jeans, ankle-length green Next wellies, a necklace and a pale blue Fitbit on. Nicola has an Essex accent and links to the Thornton-Cleveleys area near Blackpool. Anybody with information about where she might be is asked to call 101, quoting log 473 of January 27, or ring 999 for immediate sightings.

Schoolboy stabbed to death by canal as teenager charged with murder,"A 15-YEAR-OLD schoolboy was stabbed in the chest by another youth after they went to a canal for a pre-arranged fight, a murder trial has heard. Zane Smart was stabbed by a 16 year old - who cannot be named - in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, in May last year. The defendant, now aged 17, became ""irate"" that his victim was riding a bike nearby, following a dispute several months earlier. The defendant, now aged 17, denies murder and possession of a knife in public without lawful excuse - but accepts causing the wound which caused Zane's death, jurors were told on Tuesday. Opening the Crown's case, prosecutor Harpreet Singh Sandhu KC said the youth, who cannot be named because of his age, had also posted a message on social media alongside a picture of Zane, saying which postcode he was located in. The prosecutor told the court: ""On the 27th of May 2022 two teenagers arranged to meet alone so that they could fight. ""Each teenager armed himself with a knife before they met to fight. When they met they used the knives they each had to attack the other. ""One of the teenagers was Zane Smart. He caused minor injuries to the other teenager… (who) used the knife he had to stab Zane Smart to the chest."" Mr Sandhu said of the defendant, who cannot be identified because of his age: ""He accepts that on the 27th of May of last year he was carrying a knife in Pendeford, here in Wolverhampton. The question for you is likely to be why did he carry that knife?"" There had been ""some tension"" between Zane and the boy accused of murder, the court heard, before they took different routes from a car park near a chip shop to an area beside the Shropshire Union Canal. Talking jurors through CCTV footage of the boys in the area of the chip shop, Mr Sandhu told the court: ""It's the presence of Zane which made (the defendant) irate. ""The plan for (the defendant) and Zane to have a fight was now born. By now they were on the move - they were moving towards the canal. ""CCTV footage suggests that each of them took a slightly different route to the area of the canal. ""The fight itself was not caught on CCTV cameras and we therefore turn to witness evidence to assist us."" The court was told a witness had described seeing Zane after the stabbing as he ran over a canal bridge towards his bike.Jurors also heard that the youth who is on trial suffered superficial injuries to his left arm, forehead and left wrist, along with damage to his clothing which ""corresponded"" with his injuries. The trial continues. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21306505/schoolboy-stabbed-death-canal-charged-murder/
"‘Killer’ husband of Emma Pattison ‘reported her to cops for striking him’ years before he ‘shot wife & daughter, 7’","THE husband of a headteacher found dead on school grounds reported her to police for allegedly striking him years before her death, it is claimed. George Pattison, who cops suspect killed his wife Emma, seven-year-old daughter Lettie and then himself in a double murder-suicide last weekend, made the allegations in 2016. He is said to have contacted Surrey Police to say his partner had hit him and she was spoken to by officers.  But he later withdrew the claim as he decided it was trivial, The Times reports.  George, 39, Emma, 45, and little Lettie were found dead on the grounds of Epsom College, Surrey, where Emma was headmistress, in the early hours of February 5.  Detectives believe the dad shot his partner and daughter being turning the gun on himself.  The chartered accountant held a shotgun licence, which had recently been updated, and a weapon registered in his name. Cops have not disclosed the cause of deaths but a firearm belonging to George was discovered at the family home with their bodies.  The case is being treated as a double murder-suicide. George had been in contact with Surrey Police just days before the killings on February 2 to change the address on his gun licence after the family moved to the school site from Caterham. The force said this was a ""routine"" formality, but due to how recently the update was made, the incident has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). George is thought to have killed his family late on Saturday night.  Earlier that evening, his wife made a distress call to a relative with concerns about her partner, the BBC reports. By the time they arrived at the house, which is surrounded by other properties occupied by college staff and is close to the prestigious school's rifle range, all three were dead. A school worker living nearby is believed to have raised the alarm after hearing suspected gunshots. Yesterday it emerged George had a gun licence and a weapon belonging to him was recovered at the scene. He had spoken to cops three days before the tragedy notifying them of a change of address for the licence after the family’s move to Epsom College, Surrey. Detective Chief Inspector Kimball Edey, senior investigating officer on the case, said: ""This is an incredibly traumatic incident and we are working around the clock to investigate and understand the exact circumstances which led to this point."" Emma was only appointed headmistress at the £42,000-a-year boarding school five months ago. She lived on-site with her daughter, Labrador puppy Bella and husband George, who ran a management consultancy firm called Tanglewood 2016, according to Companies House. Despite moving to Epsom from their £1.5million property in Caterham last year, the Pattisons reportedly only recently finished transporting the last of their belongings. Removal vans were spotted outside the four-bedroom detached home, where they had lived since 2014, in the last few weeks. Surrey Police has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct due to the force’s contact with Mr Pattison before the killings.  A spokesman said yesterday: “The incident at an address within Epsom College in the early hours of Sunday, February 5, is now being treated as a homicide investigation. “Officers were called to the property at around 1.10am by the South East Coast Ambulance Service. “On arrival they found the bodies of three people who police are confident are Emma Pattison, daughter Lettie and her husband George. “The deaths have been reported to the coroner for formal identification. The family’s next of kins have been informed and are being supported. “At this stage, officers are confident there is no third-party involvement and there is no wider threat or risk to the community. “A firearm was found at the scene and has been recovered by officers, however, causes of death will not be confirmed until post-mortems have been completed later this week. “We can confirm the firearm was licensed and registered to George Pattison. We had contact with George on Thursday, February 2, after he notified us of a previous change of address, as is routine. “We are aware of speculation regarding a firing range on the site. “We can confirm this range does not form part of our scene or our inquiries. Any reporting to suggest otherwise is inaccurate.” Det Chief Insp Kimball Edey said: “This is an incredibly traumatic incident and we are working to understand the exact circumstances which led to this point.” Insp Jon Vale, Epsom and Ewell’s borough commander, said: “I know this incident has caused upset and sent shockwaves through the local community. Although we are confident there is no risk to the wider public, I fully understand the concern this has caused.” Emma was a wonderful teacher, but most of all she was a delightful person. The loss of the ""much-loved"" head and her ""lovely"" family has shaken the community. One former neighbour said: ""It is just shocking and unimaginable.""

THE UK has some of the strictest gun laws in the world.  If you have the correct permit, you can own sporting rifles and shotguns. You cannot buy a shotgun or ammunition until the age of 18. But, people under the age of 18 can own an air weapon as long as they are supervised by a person over the age of 21. People under 15 may be granted a shotgun certificate and may borrow a shotgun under supervision of a person who is over the age of 21. Anyone who owns or uses a firearm in the UK needs to have an appropriate licence or certificate from their local police. Firearms and shotgun certificates are valid for five years, after which they will have to be renewed. You must also have a certificate to buy ammunition. There are restrictions when it comes to physical or mental health conditions that could affect your ability to safely own and use a firearm.  This includes, for example, epilepsy, stroke, stress-related illness, depression, alcoholism, heart disease, cancer. And you must not withhold information about any convictions when applying. Local police forces must be satisfied that the applicant has good reason for having a weapon, they are fit to be entrusted with one, and public safety will not be endangered.

Heartless council is turning our quaint village into Legoland housing estate – it will cause chaos and destroy our view,"FARMER Aidan Harrison peers from his back garden across an unspoiled view of rolling green fields. But the picturesque vista, which featured on hit detective show Vera, is soon to be occupied by 65 new red brick houses. Shaking his head, the 73-year-old tells The Sun: ""I think it's outrageous to allow a housing development to be thrown up in the middle of all that beauty - but no one is going to tell me I'm a Nimby."" Residents of Thropton, a village nestled at the foot of the Simonside Hills in Northumberland's Coquet Valley, are about to see their lives transformed. The medieval hamlet, developed in the Victorian era to provide homes for farmers and their workers, will see its population increase by around 40 per cent thanks to a housing development dubbed ""Legoland"" that it's now too late to stop. Objectors took a minibus on the 80-mile round trip to Berwick to voice their fury at the decisive planning meeting, only to see the decision rubber stamped by Northumberland County Council. It means a large swathe of land at the north end of the village will be built on, changing the peaceful settlement forever. Supporters say it will breathe new life into the village, encouraging young people to stay instead of travelling south to Newcastle to find houses they can afford. Critics are horrified, claiming the village road system andinfrastructure can't support the influx, and that the houses are an ugly blot on an otherwise perfect landscape. Aidan, born at Rothbury Cottage Hospital in the next village along the valley, has worked the land in this remote corner of Northumberland all his life. He says: ""It is a fabulous landscape, it's special and it should have been allowed to remain that way. ""Those of us who object - and there are many - get called Nimbies, but I don't care about my own backyard. What I care about is the beautiful landscape that surrounds this village and preserving it for future generations. ""I'm not getting any younger myself but I'd like to leave this place pretty much as I found it, because once it has gone, it's gone forever. There's no going back. ""But no one at the planning authority seemed to care. They wanted these houses, and we now have to accept they're going to be built whether we like it or not. ""It will be so jarring to see these red brick houses thrown up at the edge of a village built in stone by the Victorians. They couldn't have made it look more out of character if they had tried to."" It will be so jarring to see these red brick houses thrown up at the edge of a village built in stone by the Victorians. They couldn't have made it look more out of character if they had tried Aidan's neighbour Margaret Adams, 70, agrees. ""If it had been inside the national park I don't think itwould have been approved,"" she tells The Sun. ""But these houses will be seen very clearly from the Simonside Hills, which are in the national park. ""People come here to get away from urban developments, and they're throwing one up anyway without a thought about the ecology of the area or the infrastructure. ""With the houses will come much, much more traffic. At one end of the village is a hump-backed bridge which can only allow one car at a time to cross. ""With the village growing by 40 per cent, how will the roads cope with the traffic? They will have to commute because there are no jobs to be had here, so we can expect things to be chaotic. ""It will ruin a beautiful part of the world and the views of the local people were never considered in the rush to push this through. ""I'm now a proud nimby, I don't apologise for that, I'm perfectly happy to admit it. I'm now a proud nimby, I don't apologise for that, I'm perfectly happy to admit it ""I got very angry at the planning meeting and wrote an open letter telling the councillors involved that they were complacent and responsible for appalling house building all over our glorious Northumberland countryside. ""The county councillor wrote back and said my comments were tiresome, offensive and ill-judged - so that says everything about how much our opinions were valued."" When the plans were first mooted in 2013, former local authority chief executive Maurice Cole threw himself into leading objections. Mr Cole died last year, still engaged in a losing battle with the planners. His widow Christine, 79, says: ""He was quite correct that thisdevelopment is completely wrong for Thropton, but unfortunately it is happening regardless. ""We have all these red brick boxes about to be squeezed into the fields at the edge of the village, they couldn't look more out of place. ""And what I wonder is, where will it stop? There are houses being built on two neighbour sites, what's to stop them opening another and another? ""The roads are in a poor enough condition as it is, but with all these houses coming that's going to get much worse. I don't see how the village school can cope with such an influx either. ""It was a very sad day for the village and the area when these plans were passed."" The plans received 45 objections from local residents, citingover-development and the impact on schools and other local facilities. Thropton Parish Council also objected and said it would be a""disproportionate increase in the size of the village"". The parish council's objection added: ""The appearance of the housing is of great concern as we have a responsibility for the future to ensure that what makes Northumberland scenic and attractive to visitors is maintained. This includes local tourism and recreation for adjacent urban areas."" At the village pub, the Three Wheat Heads, landlord George Yule, 52, isn't complaining too much. He says: ""It's bound to bring in trade so obviously I have nocomplaints at all about that. I think in many ways it will bring new life into the village and probably a lot of younger people. ""So from a business point of view I'm very happy to support the development."" He stops and looks round at a Northumbria Water worker carrying out an inspection of the village's drains. George continued: ""But when you look at the drains and the roads and the school it does make you wonder how much pressure that many people coming into the village will place on the infrastructure. It's a lot of people."" Author Tom Dean, 91, is also happy with the plans, admitting: ""Nowhere can stay exactly the same forever.  ""This is a lovely village in a beautiful part of the world and to have some new and maybe younger people here can't be a bad thing to my mind."" Stewart Rogers, 75, is a partner with Valley View Developments, the company which obtained planning permission on behalf of the owner of the land. He says builders will be breaking ground on the site as early as May this year and admits the plan has been divisive. This is a lovely village in a beautiful part of the world and to have some new and maybe younger people here can't be a bad thing to my mind Mr Rogers says: ""I've come in for quite a bit of flak myself and Iknow this has not been popular with some people around this village. ""But if you are someone who would rather see young people leave the village than have the view from your living room window spoiled, then something is surely wrong. ""We need to provide affordable housing for young people and villages likes this one can't simply stay the same, with its population getting older and older. ""There has to be change and new life and new people to keep villages like Thropton thriving for the next generation."" Northumberland County Council has been approached for comment. The picturesque views around Thropton featured in detective show Vera. The hamlet’s neighbouring village of Rothbury was used in a series two episode called Silent Voices in which a social worker drowned. Vera producer Margaret Mitchell said she was struck by the views around Rothbury - where the news homes will now be built. She says: “This is where we filmed the wild water swimmer. “We arrived very early in the morning, on an October day when it was very misty. The sun was rising and shone through the water – that was particularly beautiful. It’s a great place for walking. ""When you’re here, you’re completely struck by the expansive land, the light and the skies. ""You can see the vast panorama of countryside, the light just fills your eyes. It’s incredible.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/uknews/21302594/village-thropton-ruined-new-estate/
What happened to Nicola Bulley? Latest theories explained,"ELEVEN days after Nicola Bulley vanished without a trace, investigators are no closer to finding the mum-of-two. The 45-year-old was last seen on a dog walk along a towpath at around 9.15am on January 27, in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire. On Monday a specialist search and rescue team called Specialist Group International (SGI) deployed a £55,000 Sonar to scan the River Wyre for the the mortgage advisor. The search, which began downstream in a tidal stretch of river, has now moved up to near a bench where Nicola's phone and dog harness were found. Here, The Sun Online looks at all the theories about Nicola's disappearance.  SGI's CEO Peter Faulding has given mixed theories about Nicola, changing his mind throughout Monday and Tuesday's search. But he told BBC Breakfast today he thinks Nicola's phone - found on a bench after she went missing and still connected to a meeting - could be a ""decoy"" from a ""third party"". He explained: “If Nicola is not in that stretch of river today my view is that there is a third party involved and this was a decoy placed by the river. “It could have been placed as a decoy, there is not enough CCTV to cover particular areas here. The police are working hard in the background to cover everything. “It’s so unusual, we’ve got no clear information to go on."" Mr Faulding went on to claim that if cannot find the mum-of-two today, his ""gut"" feeling is there may be other reasons for her vanishing. He previously told Sky News that ""none of this rings right to me"" and that it was ""my belief is she’s not in the river at all"". He is leading a team from Specialist Group International (SGI), assisting divers from Lancashire Police. The team, from Dorking, Surrey, are forensic experts responsible for assisting cops across the south east with underwater search operations. Despite varying theories, police are still working on the hypothesis that Nicola ""sadly"" fell into the River Wyre. Cops are confident, after reviewing CCTV, that Ms Bulley did not leave the field near the river via Rowanwater. And she did not return from the fields along Allotment Lane or via the path at the rear of the Grapes pub onto Garstang Road. The findings, aided by data from the mum-of-two's fitbit fitness watch, have led them to focus on a specific path. The track from the fields, where she was last seen, to Garstang Road in St Michaels on Wyre, may hold vital clues. Lancashire Constabulary are now appealing to drivers and cyclists to come forward who may have footage from the morning of January 27 when Nicola vanished. ""Every piece of footage helps us build up a picture of movements on that morning"", the force said. They will also be sending letters to travellers who they think may have been driving down Garstang Road that morning. Only drivers with dashcam footage are asked to email NicolaBulleyInvestigation@lancashire.police.uk to let police know. Monday's search for Nicola, 45, focused downstream on the tidal area of the River Wyre in Lancashire but Tuesday's search will take place further upstream. The search area will include and go beyond the area where Nicola's belongings were found on a bench near Garstang Road, in St Michael's on Wyre. It is a non-tidal area of the river. Peter Faulding explained: ""If Nicola is in the river, she could have even fallen further up, we don't know. ""The key focus has been around the bench area, we have got to rule out everything here. ""We can't just go for the bench, we have got to cover the whole stretch of river to make sure there is no untoward circumstances here."" Peter Faulding, a rescue expert of 20 years, said signs of drowning, lack of evidence at the scene and Nicola's clothing at the time suggest she may not be in the River Wyre. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: ""Normally when a person drowns, if they are left a number of days they don't move very far. ""This is not a fast tidal river. So I would have expected her to be found by the police divers by now."" He went on to tell reporters that he believes Nicola may not be in the river ""at all"". Analysing her January 27 disappearance further, Mr Faulding said it ""feels odd"" there were no marks at the scene. He added how it was also peculiar that not one person heard screams or that she was wearing clothes that would have absorbed water quickly. On Monday night, scores of emergency service vehicles raced to the River Wyre as residents feared a concerning development in the search for Nicola. A spokesperson for Lancashire Constabulary told The Sun Online on Monday: ""We were called at 5.51pm today to Shard Road, Hambleton, in relation to the search for Nicola Bulley who is missing from St Michael’s on Wyre. ""The search of the sand and surrounding area near to Shard Bridge by Lancashire Police and the Coastguard proved negative.""

Who is Charles Bronson and when will he be released?,"BRITAIN'S most notorious prisoner Charles Bronson will attend a parole hearing in March 2023 as he aims to be released from prison. Bronson has been in various prisons over the last 50 years, but now has an opportunity for release. Here's what we know. Charles Bronson was born in 1952, with the Luton local quickly turning to gang fights in his youth. Armed robber Bronson has spent almost 50 years behind bars after repeatedly having his sentence increased for attacking prison staff and taking them hostage. He was first imprisoned in 1974. Writing in his 2000 book Bronson, he said: ""I'm a nice guy, but sometimes I lose all my senses and become nasty. ""That doesn't make me evil, just confused"". Bronson has changed his name a number of times, with his different titles defining certain periods in his life. Born Michael Gordon Peterson, he changed his name to Charles Bronson during a short stint of freedom  in 1987. He used his new persona to launch an illegal bare-knuckle fighting career, but returned to jail in 1988, keeping his new name. The criminal converted briefly to Islam in 2001 and became known as Charles Ali Ahmed after marrying Fatema Saira Rehman, a woman who had started to write to him during his time behind bars. In August 2014, Charles announced he was legally changing his name to Charles Salvador - a tribute to the artist Salvador Dali. He has married three times, his first marriage was in 1971 before his first arrest. In February 2022, it was revealed model Gemma Fernandez has reportedly struck up a friendship with the 69-year-old criminal and opened up about her visit to HMP Woodhill on her YouTube channel. Bronson was first sentenced to seven years in jail over an armed robbery in 1974 - which was extended by nine months after he attacked a fellow prisoner with a glass jug. He later attempted to strangle Gordon Robinson while at Broadmoor, before causing £250,000 worth of damage when he staged a three-day protest on a rooftop. The serial criminal was eventually released in 1987, where he changed his name to Charles Bronson on the advice of his bare-knuckle boxing promoter. But it was not long before he was back in jail, after robbing a jewellery shop in 1988 and sentenced to seven more years inside. Bronson was released early from his sentence in 1992 - but was back behind bars 53 days later for intent to commit robbery. After holding three men hostage in his cell, the Luton lad saw another seven years added to his sentence - although this was cut to five on appeal. Following further incidents, he was finally given a life sentence after kidnapping a prison teacher in 1999, causing destruction to the prison. After being held at a number of prisons across the country - including the likes of Broadmoor and Belmarsh - he returned to HM Prison Woodhill in 2018, where Bronson is currently incarcerated. In June 2020, a High Court ruled in his favour ruling for the right for his parole board meeting to be held in public in the name of a fair trial. Bronson has not been given an official release date as he is being held indefinitely. In 2017, he insisted that he will be out ""sooner than a lot think"". He made the claim amid a spat with Michael Coleman, his actress fiancee's ex. In a chilling note he wrote: ""You or anybody got anything to say (tell me when I’m out).” And he added: “AND I’ll be out sooner than a lot think…"" But in July 2018 Bronson sent a scathing letter to wife Paula saying he would ""rather die in prison"" than live her ""alcohol existence"". He has been moved prisons 120 times during his 43-year stint behind bars, much of which was spent in solitary confinement. He said: ""I'm the first man in the British Isles to have a public parole hearing. All these decades I've done."" Bronson is still behind bars in 2022. Bronson turned to art after spending decades behind bars, even changing his name to Charles Salvador and starting an art foundation in that name. The fitness fanatic even auctioned a piece of artwork and donated the proceeds to a young boy with cerebral palsy, the Milton Keynes Citizen reported. His artwork has also been displayed on the Tube but was ultimately taken down. More than 100 pieces were sold in 2014 in an attempt to ""renounce violence"" that plagued his past. Bronson married Paula Williamson on November 14, 2017 - having previously wanted to tie the knot on her birthday in August. Former Corrie actress Paula was bundled into Wakefield jail under a purple cloak after a bizarre procession through the town led by a lookalike and a woman on a mobility scooter. Charles was handcuffed to a warder for the strictly controlled two-hour ceremony witnessed by just five guests. A reception was held at a local hotel, but Paula headed to Malta without her new husband as he was led back to his cell after the ceremony. Paula emerged from the prison under a ghostly white shroud on top of her purple cloak, ensuring her dress was almost completely hidden from view. She was then smuggled into the York House Hotel through a side door to continue the celebrations with friends and family - who had their phones confiscated as she reportedly sold picture rights to a newspaper. But it seemed there were problems in the marriage after just six months with Paula admitting their relationship was ""on the rocks"" after Bronson made a series of demands about her weight. Bronson reportedly instructed the actress to do 400 sit-ups a day after ordering her “don't get fat”. This came after she learned Bronson may have set his parole back after allegedly stripping off and smearing butter on himself before challenging guards to a scrap. Bronson was reported to be demanding a divorce following the publication of pictures showing Paula on a wild night out in Tenerife letting a lad bury his head in her boobs. Williamson was found dead on July 29, 2019 at a house in Sneyd Green, Staffs Police confirmed. Her death was not treated as suspicious by police. Charlie Bronson is still in jail in 2022 and is asking the justice secretary for a free pardon. He sent a voice recording to Sky News in which he said: ""I bet you can't believe I'm still in, can you? ""It's an absolute liberty. ""I'm 70-years-old now, 70-years-old. ""I've never murdered anyone, I've never raped anyone. ""What am I in jail for? ""People don't believe it. ""They think I'm a serial killer."" His solicitor Dean Kingham wrote a letter to Justice Secretary Dominic Raab to grant Charles Bronson, who now calls himself Charles Salvador, a free pardon. The letter said: ""You have the power under the Prerogative of Mercy to grant Mr Salvador's release without requiring him to go in front of the Parole board... he has not been violent for a significant number of years and his risk is primarily towards prison governors. ""The evidence in excess of the last five years is clear that his risk of violence has significantly reduced. ""The argument is that if he's been able to demonstrate that he's not violent in very high-risk situations in custody towards staff, governors, etc. then the risk falls away if he's released into the public because historically, while there was a risk to the public, it's never been as severe as that toward prison staff and governors. ""There is very good psychological research evidence that as someone ages the risk of violence decreases. ""When someone approaches 70 the research shows that the risk drops off to zero. ""Now, he's at that age bracket."" While admitting that he understand the Parole's concern about Bronson being a threat to public safety, Kingham added: ""The Parole Board regularly releases people that have been convicted of murder. ""The whole process is based on reduction of risk."" Bronson won a court case in 2020 arguing for a public parole hearing and was granted one in November 2022. He was the first inmate in the UK to be granted a public parole hearing. It was delayed until 2023 though, much to the annoyance of Bronson. He told the WalesOnline in 2022 about his belief that he will eventually be free, saying ""Will I make it out for Christmas next year, who knows? But there's one sure thing – I'll get out of here one day and it won't be in a body bag."" In a letter sent to his son, paparazzi photographer George Bamby, Bronson said in 2023: ""We’ve  been waiting a long time for this. What will be will be now!"" He added in the note: ""I’ve worked hard to get a result, I’ve earned my freedom or at least some serious progression. Keep the faith George, I’m coming home.""

Dad guilty of killing daughter by allowing weight to balloon to 23st before she died covered in maggots in filthy room,"A DAD has been found guilty of letting his daughter's weight balloon to 23st before she died in squalor covered in maggots. Kaylea Titford, 16, was left to die in a filthy room at home in Newton, Wales, on October 10, 2020. The schoolgirl had been eating five takeaways a week and ""living in conditions not fit for animals"". Her dad Alun Titford, 45, has been found guilty of neglecting Kaylea by allowing her to become morbidly obese. The teen's mum, Sarah Lloyd-Jones, 39, previously pleaded guilty to gross negligence manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child. During a harrowing trial, jurors were told Kaylea had been fiercely independent"" before the pandemic - taking part in PE lessons in her wheelchair. But when lockdown hit, the teen, who had spina bifida, was left to die in a filthy room. The teen was forced to use ""puppy pads"" to go to the toilet on her urine-soaked floor. Her nails had also not been cut for six months and ""well grown"" maggots were found on her body. The teen's hair was matted and Kaylea, who needed help with everyday tasks, had not been washed for ""several weeks"". There were traces of fly excrement on her chair hoist with horrific pictures showing the ""squalor and degradation"" Kaylea lived in. Forensic entomologist Amoret Whitaker told the court there were maggots on Kaylea's body as well as all over her soiled bedsheets and absorbent pads. The maggots appeared to be ""feeding on the body itself"" for at least 48 hours. When police arrived at the home, one officer was ""almost sick"" from the stench of unwashed faeces in her bathroom. At the time of her death, Kaylea weighed 22.9 stone and was ""morbidly obese"" with a BMI of 70. Titford claimed to be ""shocked"" by his daughter's death and says Kaylea was mum Sarah Lloyd-Jones' responsibility. He also blamed his ""laziness"" for the state of Kaylea's bedroom and told officers: ""I'm not a very good dad"". The dad denied gross negligence manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child. He will be sentenced alongside Lloyd-Jones at a later date.

"Levi Davis: Arrest IMMINENT after emergence of bombshell evidence, says private detective leading hunt for missing star","AN arrest may be imminent over Levi Davis' disappearance, the private detective leading the hunt for the star has revealed. Gavin Burrows says he is naming names in a damning expose containing evidence the rugby player had been blackmailed by criminals and threatened over a Somali mafia debt. The private detective said the bombshell report is being sent to Spanish police and could soon lead to an arrest. Mr Burrows, whose Line of Inquiry firm is offering a £10,000 reward for information that could lead to Levi being found, said: “I believe Spanish police will have enough to make an arrest when they see what our own investigation has thrown up. “At the very least it should give them enough to haul someone in for questioning. “I’m not at liberty at the moment to go public with any names but there is one person in particular that I have grave suspicions about and believe can shed light on what has happened to Levi. “That person is someone who while pretending to help has in my view been nothing but an obstacle in trying to prevent our investigations from moving forward.” Levi, 24, spoke about being blackmailed by criminals who threatened to kill him and his family in a chilling last video he initially deleted but re-emerged last week three months after he vanished in Barcelona. He was last seen leaving an Irish pub on October 29 after taking a ferry from Ibiza.  Mr Burrows said he had retrieved the Instagram video, which X-Factor singer Levi first posted four days before he vanished, and released it with the agreement of family and friends to help get information. The ex-Bath rugby player said at the start of the 15-minute footage: “Hello my name is Levi Davis and my life is in danger.” He went on to allege he believed he was filmed performing various sexual acts after being drugged which blackmailers used to control and manipulate him. Levi added: “I was told by them in ways which are not direct but are absolutely true that they were going to attempt - if I said anything out - they were going to attempt to kill me, threaten my family. “And they also were trying to frame me.” The Somali mafia reports first surfaced in Spain shortly before the chilling video twist to the high-profile disappearance, with reports saying Levi owed around £100,000 after his lifestyle spiralled out of control. They coincided with claims Levi could have drowned in Barcelona’s port near where his passport was found, although Mr Burrows described it as a theory and said it was also possible he was still alive and being forced to work as a courier by the gang he had got into debt with. He said: “Our relationship with the Catalan police has not been as close as we’d have liked it to have been but we’re hopeful that’s going to change now because we can deal with them much more directly and not go through people Levi’s mum has confirmed to us have no mandate to speak on anyone’s behalf. “It makes it far more likely we can assist in getting a quicker resolution to this very worrying case.” Levi was taking a break in Europe after being sidelined from rugby following a knee injury. He was picked up on CCTV leaving the Old Irish Pub near Barcelona’s La Rambla around 10pm on October 29, a few hours after taking a boat from Ibiza with just 40 euros (£35) and no change of clothes. Friend Richard Squire, who formally reported him missing to cops in Barcelona after his family informed West Midlands police, described his decision to leave the island as “sudden.” Last week it emerged Levi’s Instagram had up to 38 contacts mysteriously deleted after he vanished. Levi played Premiership rugby union for Bath between 2017 and 2020, when he joined Ealing Trailfinders. A year later he signed for Worthing Raiders. The rugby player-turned-reality star performed on X Factor: Celebrity in 2019 with fellow rugby players Ben Foden and Thom Evans as part of the group Try Star. In 2020, the year he made history by becoming the first rugby union player to come out as bisexual while still playing, he appeared on the E4 dating series Celebs Go Virtual Dating.

Woman’s tragic last selfie vid moments before she drowned in fishing boat tragedy as six killed in heavy storm,"THE last moments of a woman's life were captured on film just before she drowned in a fishing boat tragedy. Michele Bayerl de Moraes de Sena posed for a selfie video while out at sea two days ago. The short clip shows Michele enjoying a boat ride in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday before she was sadly killed.  Soon after the video was filmed, a heavy storm hit Guanabara Bay forcing the boat to capsize. Michele, 43, and 13 other passengers were plunged into the water. Her daughter Larissa, 23, said: ""She texted me at 3pm, asking about my son, if he was okay.  ""I said he was with me, and then she didn't say anything else."" Michele's husband Evandro Jose de Sena, 55, also died in the tragedy. Footage filmed by fisherman Mateus Diniz - who's boat survived the conditions - showed storm clouds creeping in as the water got choppy. A total of six people have currently been confirmed dead while firefighters search for two who are unaccounted for. They have been named as Fabio Dantas Soares, 46, and Isabel Cristina de Souza Borges, 38. Among the couple who died are 14-year-old Eduardo Borges da Silva Correa and three-year-old Caio Gomes da Silva. The two other victims have been identified as Everson Costa de Assuncao, 45, and Juliana Gomes de Lana da Silva, 35. According to reports, the six survivors avoided death by clinging to the hull after the boat capsized. They were picked up by a passing vessel and given first aid.

Inside Andrew Tate’s bizarre jail routine as he moans about ‘self-control’ and missing ‘daily pleasures’ behind bars,"ANDREW Tate has revealed his bizarre jail routine as he complained about missing ""daily pleasures"" behind bars. The 36-year-old influencer has been held in a hellhole jail in Romania for more than a month with his brother Tristan. They were detained on December 29 as part of a probe into human trafficking, rape, and organised crime. Last week, a judge rejected their second appeal to be released and ordered them to remain in jail until at least the end of February. Tate has now sent an email to his subscribers, moaning about life behind bars. He wrote: ""There is only one way to survive in jail. That is with absolute self-control and discipline. ""In jail, your daily pleasures are extremely small. Phone calls and hot coffee. ""When you wake up, you will naturally want to grab a nice hot coffee and make your phone calls. ""But this is an amateur mistake. Your daily pleasures are limited, if you use it up the first thing in the morning you are doomed to a day of misery."" Tate said ""to counter this"" he ""puts obstacles in"" his way - 550 push-ups, 100 dips, four litres of waters and 200 squats. He added: ""I have a list to complete before my coffee or phone calls begin. ""Without self-control, jail would be 100x worse. Much like real life."" In another newsletter, Tate insisted he would fork out $10,000 (£8,000) for a coffee or a hot shower and said cockroaches, lice and bedbugs were his ""friends"" at night. He and his brother Tristan, 34, are accused of luring women back to their Romanian villa. At least six were allegedly forced to perform in adult videos that were then sold online. Andrew Tate looked exhausted as he stepped out of a police van outside the court in Bucharest last Wednesday ahead of the appeal. Handcuffed to his brother, he yelled: ""You know I'm innocent."" The Tates' American lawyer, Tina Glandian, had argued Tristan should have been released from jail as he has a three-week-old baby he hasn't met yet. But the judge said the ""possibility of them evading investigations cannot be ignored"" - and added ""they could leave Romania and settle in countries that do not allow extradition"".

She makes a fresh bid for sympathy in a new BBC documentary tonight - but also admits it was ""exciting"" being smuggled into Syria to join gun-toting killers. Shamima, now 23, was interviewed at the camp where she is being held in northern Syria following the collapse of the ISIS ""Caliphate"". She was just 15 when she and two school pals sneaked away from home in Bethnal Green, East London, in February 2015. She was ""in love"" with ISIS and desperate to join, she tells BBC2 doc The Shamima Begum Story, which airs tonight at 9pm. The ISIS bride tells how they flew from Gatwick to Istanbul, where an ISIS handler waited with them for a bus. After arriving in Gaziantep near the Syrian border, they met ISIS smuggler Mohammed Rasheed - who was also allegedly selling info to Canadian spies. He secretly recorded video footage of Shamima and her pals Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana at the bus station being helped into separate cars. Shamima says they switched cars ""about seven times"" before crossing into the ISIS badlands. She said: ""We crossed the border. It was just a big field of nothing. ""And there were like men wearing all black with their faces covered, with guns on their arms. ""And it was just a bit surreal, you know, seeing it in person. ""I mean at that time it was kind of exciting. It was kind of exciting, yeah. It was different."" She said she did not think of them as dangerous terrorists, adding: ""No. I thought they're here to protect me. ""They have these guns to protect me and to protect women like me and to protect the Muslims. ""So I did not think in my wildest dreams that they would hurt me."" She also said she never changed her mind about joining ISIS - even after being handed a phone to watch gruesome execution videos. She said: ""I just thought, there's no turning back. I've already done it, I might as well see it through."" Shamima went to ISIS capital Raqqa where she married Dutch jihadi Yago Riedijk - six years older at 21. She has begged to be allowed to return to the UK and has appealed against a decision to strip her of British citizenship. Supporters claim she is a victim of trafficking - but the government says she went to Syria with her ""eyes wide open"" and is a danger to society. Previous reports have claimed she was a member of the brutal ISIS religious police, carried an AK-47 on street patrols and sewed suicide bombers into their explosive vests. She denies all the claims in the new BBC doc, claiming she was ""just a housewife"" who was rarely allowed outside. However the film also reveals Shamima lived for seven months with a mysterious Egyptian who allegedly supplied ISIS with weapons. The ISIS bride claims she did not know his name - but also hails him as a ""father figure"" and says she does not believe he was a notorious arms dealer. It is one of several scenes where she appears reluctant to admit the truth. Shamima claims she ""did not know"" about ISIS atrocities - such as the filmed beheadings of British aid workers - before she left London. She tells the BBC doc: ""I got my news on social media ""And the people I spoke to on social media were saying, no it's not true, it's an exaggeration, they're just trying to make ISIS look bad because they hate Islam."" Filmmaker Josh Baker reminds her the sick videos were not only big news at the time but were all over YouTube and Twitter. She blusters: ""But they were constantly being taken down and like being deleted so it was very hard to watch these videos.  ""And the people who I was talking to who were in ISIS didn't send these videos either."" However she goes on to say she did watch ISIS propaganda portraying Raqqa as ""utopia"". And she admits she was aware of a video of a Jordanian pilot being burned to death in a savage public execution. She claims her close pal Sharmeena Begum - who had already fled to Syria - convinced her it was a media lie. She says: ""Because she was there and I wanted to be a part of the Islamic State and I just... ""It's like when you are in love and you just don't wannFa see the person's faults. ""So you just like, push them to the back of your head or you just completely deny that they are there. You know. ""Like I was in love with the idea of ISIS. So I just always made excuses for them."" Tory MP Tim Loughton hits back: ""I don't believe it. And no reasonable person would believe it. ""However much you are a teenager watching At Home With The Kardashians, doing loads of stuff on social media, being physically welded to your mobile phone - nobody, particularly three intelligent students from East London, could have been absolutely oblivious to the horrors that were being waged by Daesh out in Syria and Iraq at that time. ""It just doesn't wash."" Shamima struggles to stifle a smirk and frequently looks away while being quizzed about her life in ISIS capital Raqqa. She says it ""almost felt like being in a movie"" and gushes about how ""normal"" it was - although very different from Bethnal Green. In a previous interview with The Times, she admitted she was ""not fazed"" by seeing severed heads in bins. In the BBC doc she claims she never witnessed public executions as her husband did not allow her outside. Shamima shifts in her seat when asked if she ever stitched suicide bombers into their vests. She says: ""No. Not at all."" She also denies trying to recruit for ISIS - but laughs when asked if she communicated with friends back in London. ""I don't want to answer that question,"" she says. She also denies receiving any form of ISIS training or being part of the feared Hisbah religious police. However another woman who admits being a member of the Hisbah also speaks to the filmmaker. She reveals she personally saw Shamima at a training camp where women received weapons training and religious instruction. Shamima recalls her happiness at being married to jihadi Riedijk - and her shock when he was sent to jail as a suspected spy days later. The film reveals she lived for the next seven months in the house of an older man who was originally from Egypt. And she appears extremely uncomfortable being asked about his identity. Filmmaker Josh Baker says he asked her about the man known as Abu Qomra repeatedly over six interviews. She gives various answers, at first claiming she can't remember his name, then saying his real name was Saeed. And she adds: ""He was really nice to me, like a father figure."" Smiling nervously, blinking and shaking her head, she claims she had no idea he was a senior figure in ISIS. However a neighbour in Raqqa tells the doc: ""He was responsible for providing weapons. ""He was a vicious person, a bad person - bad in the full sense of the word. ""If she was living with him she would have know all the details about his life. ""It's impossible she didn't know"". Asked about claims he was an armourer for ISIS, Shamima responds: ""I don't believe that."" An intelligence expert tells the film Shamima has good reason to fear being associated with such a dangerous figure. Also in the documentary, Shamima blames the press for ""obsessing"" over her links to ISIS, and moans it would be ""unfair"" to put her on trial for supporting the terrorists. She also apologises for crass comments about the Manchester Arena bombing, which she previously said was ""retaliation"" for air strikes in Syria.  And she says she regrets joining ISIS, and would tell her teenage self: ""Don't do it b***h"". She adds she no longer believes she will get back to the UK, saying: ""Because ISIS was the worst thing of the 21st century and I was a part of it and now I have to face the consequences of my actions. ""And this camp is the consequences of my actions."" The documentary was filmed alongside a ten-part podcast. The BBC was slammed for giving Begum a ""platform"" last month. And an author who also interviewed Begum said she is faking remorse to rehabilitate her image. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21305502/shamima-begum-isis-exciting-telltale-clues-threat/
‘Porn passports’ to be rolled out in France to verify age of users in world-first move… could it come to UK?,"FRANCE is set to be the first country to force internet users to prove they are over 18 to access sex websites. The so-called ""porn passports"" will be rolled out by September under plans drawn up by the country's digital minister, Jean-Noel Barrot. At the moment in France, people only have to click a button to confirm they are older than 18. But within months users will have to download a government phone application that will give them a digital certificate and code. To access explicit material, the code will need to be entered, Le Parisien reports. Barrot said the system will ""work a bit like the checks from your bank when you buy something online"". He added: ""2023 will mark the end of our children accessing pornographic sites. ""I mean to end this scandal. I intend to have this law respected once and for all."" If websites do not comply with the age verification protocol, they could be banned. It comes as the UK eyes up a potential move to age verification as Tory MPs demand tougher checks on those accessing porn. They have demanded an amendment to the Online Safety Bill before it is put to Parliament, that would force sites where kids can see porn to have age verification within six months. It would cover sites such as Pornhub as well as user-generated platforms including OnlyFans. The proposed amendment is supported by 14 charities. A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: “The Bill already has comprehensive and world-leading provisions in it to tackle underage access to online pornography.  ""Any site hosting pornography will have to put in place robust measures such as age verification to prevent underage access or face huge fines."" A survey of 1,000 youngsters revealed children as young as nine are watching graphic material online. But it also showed how the majority, 41 per cent, asked accessed sexual content on Twitter rather than adult sites. Meanwhile, parents have been urgently warned that their children can access porn and be exposed to fake health advice on TikTok. An investigation by the Sunday Telegraph uncovered videos accessible by kids that contain links to porn, self-harm, and dangerous health advice.

"Deadliest-ever day for Russia in Ukraine meatgrinder war as 1,000 troops are killed ‘advancing just 30ft’","RUSSIA has suffered its deadliest day on the battlefield after Ukraine claimed to have killed over 1,000 troops in just 24 hours.  The blood of Putin's men was reportedly spilled before they had even advanced 30ft as they staged another winter assault in the east. Tens of thousands of mobilised Russian soldiers have been engaged in close-contact trench warfare as they try to take hold of the city of Bakhmut. It has been the backdrop for a string of bloody battles for months, but Putin's forces have now changed tactics.   Instead of hastily trying to capture different areas of Ukraine at once, Russia is now conducting concentrated battles on specific fronts.  It's in response to a string of humiliating defeats, as Ukraine wiped out much of Russia's war machine and recaptured territory. Ukraine's defence minister Oleksii Reznikov said they have learned from their mistakes of having ""scattered resources."" He told Pravda: ""Now their new tactic is concentrated, creeping attempts to capture, little by little, ten metres at a time, push away and wring out."" But Russia only able to capture a few 100m of territory a week as ""inexperienced"" units being used as cannon fodder to try and achieve ""unrealistic objectives"".  Reznikov said his war-torn nation is on standby for huge assaults as the symbolic anniversary of the full-scale invasion, February 24, approaches.  But Ukraine claims to currently have a leg up on the enemy after reportedly wiping out over 1,030 men in just 24 hours. Clashes on the snow-covered battlefields yesterday are said to have left the area littered with Russian corpses.  It marks the highest daily death toll of the war so far, although the figure was not independently verified.  It would take their tally of Putin's personnel killed since the start of the war to a whopping 133, 190.  Ukraine also claim to have wiped out 14 tanks, 28 armoured combat vehicles, one artillery system, three vehicles and tankers as well as five special vehicles. The Russian military claim to have inflicted 6,500 Ukrainian casualties in January alone, but has not updated its own death toll since September.  The armed forces have made little progress in their pursuit of seizing the city of Bakhmut in the meatgrinder war.  Putin is now pouring reinforcements into Eastern Ukraine to beef up his winter offensive - amid fears he is plotting a major move to coincide with the first anniversary of the conflict.  Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Ukrainian military intelligence, has predicted between 300,000 and 500,000 Russians will likely be drafted. That figure is on top of the hundreds of thousands of mobilised men signed up to service by the Russian President. Serhiy Haidai, the Ukrainian governor of Luhansk, said: ""We are seeing more and more [Russian] reserves being deployed in our direction, we are seeing more equipment being brought in. ""They bring ammunition that is used differently than before - it is not round-the-clock shelling anymore.  ""They are slowly starting to save, getting ready for a full-scale offensive. ""It will most likely take them 10 days to gather reserves. After Feb. 15 we can expect [this offensive] at any time."" Russian forces are reportedly keen to recoup last year's losses this month, after their progress stagnated amid Ukraine's spectacular counter-offensives.  But Putin's bumbling men appear to have been replaced by brutal mercenaries from the Wagner Group, who continue to surround Bakhmut to bag a ""symbolic"" victory. The invaders are expected to push towards Slovyansk and Kramatorsk if they succeed, potentially permitting Moscow to capture the entire eastern Donetsk region. Polish think tank Rochan Consulting estimated at the start of January that around 30,000 Ukrainian troops were defending Bakhmut.  The frantic fight has proved costly for both sides, with each suffering high casualties on the tough terrain, with very little ground gained.  However, Russia's big plans of a devastating land grab were deemed ""unrealistic, by a UK Ministry of Defence assessment. It stated: ""Russian forces have only managed to gain several hundred metres of territory per week.  ""This is almost certainly because Russia now lacks the munitions and manoeuvre units required for successful offensives. ""Russian leaders will likely continue to demand sweeping advances. It remains unlikely that Russia can build up the forces needed to substantially affect the outcome of the war within the coming weeks.""

Huge shark attack update as major missed warning sign that could have saved girl killed by great white is revealed,"THE shark that killed a girl was reportedly sighted 24 hours before the fatal attack - and the missed warning might have cost the teen her life.  Stella Berry, 16, was killed by a shark when she went swimming with friends in the Swan River, Perth on Saturday. The first fatality in the river for 100 years.  An 8ft bull shark, like the one responsible for Stella's death, was spotted near to the traffic bridge where she was killed less than 24 hours before, 7News reported. Crucially, the sighting was only reported to the Western Australian Government's SharkSmart tracker after the 16-year-old's tragic death. The teen had been jet skiing with friends on Saturday around 3.30pm local time when she spotted a pod of dolphins and jumped into the water to swim with them. The shark allegedly then appeared from the murky river waters and dragged her under the surface as terrified friends watched on. A male onlooker was reported to have bravely jumped in and pulled her out of the water.  Police and paramedics rushed to the scene but she was too badly wounded to be saved. Tributes across Australia have been pouring in for the schoolgirl, with friends explaining that her death ""doesn't feel real"". The teenager’s parents Sophie and Matt Berry have appealed for “space and time we need to grieve our darling girl”. “We are devastated and deeply shocked by the loss of our beautiful daughter Stella,” they said.  “We want to acknowledge the amazing support we have received from our family, friends, authorities and the WA community.” Fremantle District Acting Inspector Paul Robinson said: ""It’s an extremely traumatic event for everyone involved and obviously, anyone that knew the young girl."" Robinson added it was ""unusual"" for a shark to be so far down river, which flows from Perth into the Indian Ocean. Bull sharks are not uncommon in rivers, however the last fatal attack in Swan River in North Fremantle took place in 1923, when a 13-year-old boy was killed.  Near-misses have occurred in recent years, including Cameron Wrathall who amazingly escaped from a bull shark attack with only a leg injury.  The father-of-two has been campaigning for better safety measures, including a shark barrier.  The Fisheries Minister, Don Punch, said on Sunday: ""There’s only been six recorded historical attacks in the river, and this would make it seven."" However, he said that they would look into new measures, including shark barriers to protect swimming areas. As the news of the prior-sighting of the vicious beast came to light, another shark was spotted off a busy beach in Dongara, Western Australia on Tuesday. Footage shows the terrifying moment a massive shark stalked swimmers in the shallow waters.  People then begin to scream and shout ""shark!"" and ""get out the water"" as the beast lurks close to the bathers.  The species of the shark has yet to be confirmed, however experts have said that the size, shape and fin could suggest it is a Great White.  Numerous other sightings of sharks have been reported across Western Australia following Stella's death as people are on high-alert.

"Graduates offered eye-watering £115,000 starting salary with bonus of dream holiday for top performer… here’s why","A BOSS is paying new graduates a starting salary of £115,000 plus generous perks - as well as the chance of a dream holiday. A group of 40 recruits will also get free cooked breakfasts, coffees and lunches and free sports classes at their offices in Sydney, Australia. The graduates signed on to work for global finance firm IMC Trading, which employs 280 people in Sydney. They will each get base pay of £72,000 plus a £14,000 sign-on fee and a £29,000 bonus if they make it past probation. The total first-year pay is more than double the average income for all full-time workers in Australia, reports news.com.au. Perks include gym membership, unlimited free coffees from the in-house barista and buffet lunches and dinners. IMC revealed the eye-watering package as it launched a contest to win a £20,000 holiday at a secret island hideaway. University students, online gamers and people already working in the industry are encouraged to have a go on a trading simulator. The top performer wins the holiday plus a guaranteed place on the graduate scheme next year. IMC's Matt Benney said the competition “was created to help us reach the best talent in the world”. However rival firms are offering even bigger pay packages to attract top graduates. Fellow trading firm Jane Street reportedly pays £202,000 while Amsterdam-based trading platform Optiver pays £144,000 to new starters. Perks at Optiver include chair massages, gym membership, free breakfast and lunch, coffee from the in-house barista, a work from home allowance, and an annual trip away. Experts say firms are having to up the ante in response to a skills shortage in Australia. A report by KPMG found attracting and keeping staff is now the number one worry for executives. Most rank it higher than cyber risks, digital transformation, regulation and flexible working practices. Last year, financial technology company Iress gave staff more time off, allowing them to take six long weekends every year without using up their holiday. And design company Canva introduced a ""vibe and thrive allowance"", which staff can choose to spend on gym memberships, home office set ups, social celebrations, wellbeing and education. Catering group Victorian Only offered chefs a year's free accommodation in beachside homes, on top of their £49,000 salary. Last year we revealed a dream job vacancy for someone to live on a tiny island with free rent and food. Another dream job involves watching Netflix and napping all day for £24,000. Meanwhile Brit jobseekers have revealed what they want most - and it's not all about money. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21304300/graduates-eye-watering-starting-salary-perks-bonus-holiday/
"I’m mid-sized with DDD boobs – I hate wearing bras, but I have to because I need support","A TIKTOK influencer has told her followers that she hates wearing bras but has no other choice because she needs the support. Busty influencer Emma Bocciaa posted a clip to TikTok, joking about the bra struggles she faces with her huge DDD boobs, the equivalent to a UK size F. Shared with her 18.8k followers, she captioned the video “no hate to the big bitty queens that don’t wear bras, I personally just hate how it makes my posture lol”. The TikTok shows the 20-year-old pretending to have a conversation with an A-cup friend while saying: “Man I HATE bras”. Emma then jumps into the character of the smaller chested friend and replies: “then just don’t wear one”. She ends the video, which uses the popular track Cool Kids by Echosmith, by looking down sarcastically at her chest while lip syncing the lyrics “I wish that I could be like the cool kids”.  The video has since racked up 308k likes and over 1,300 comments from sympathetic followers. One user wrote: “I’m a G cup so I feel your pain.” Another replied: “34H here, and I can 100% relate to this."" However, not all of Emma’s followers could relate and some showed their envy towards the influencer's jaw-dropping bra size. One girl commented: “Must be nice, I don’t have any.” Another said: “Ur the cool kid.” A third joked: “Look ladies… just remember that everyone has sometimes the good Lord make y’all so perfect he takes one thing away to keep you humble."" Meanwhile a plus-sized influencer took to TikTok to tell fans how she doesn’t listen to people who say she has a huge chest, despite being a size 42K. Known by her followers as ToKyo, she states in a viral clip that she knows her boobs are “huge” and doesn’t need people to tell her.  Fans were impressed by the influencer's honesty when addressing the questions about her chest. One person wrote: ""See, I like ladies that are simple and straightforward, answered all the questions without trying to be sarcastic. Thank you!"" Another TikTok influencer, Katy Potts, also spoke out on her naturally big boobs, claiming that people always tell her to ""cover up'"" and ask her if they're ""even real"". She went on to list the comments she has heard a thousand times from random men. ""You should donate some to me,"" is one. Others were intrusive: ""Are they even real lol."" And even more were rude: ""Nice t*ts love."" The English content creator is not prepared to take the comments any longer and while posing in a revealing black one-piece swimming costume, opened her latest video with the caption: ""You have naturally big boobs.

"More than 100,000 civil servants to strike on Budget Day next month in row over pay","JEREMY Hunt’s Budget risks being sabotaged by 100,000 civil servants going on strike that day. The Public and Commercial Services union today announced members across 123 government departments will walk out on March 15. It coincides with the next wave of teacher strikes as workers continue to take industrial action over pay. PCS bosses have been demanding a 10 per cent wage rise as well as no redundancies. General Secretary Mark Serwotka said: “""Rishi Sunak doesn't seem to understand that the more he ignores our members' demands for a pay rise to get them through the cost-of-living crisis, the more angry and more determined he makes them.” He claimed 40,000 civil servants have had to use a foodbank due to a “completely unacceptable decline in their pay.” Border Force, DVLA, DVSA, DWP and Rural Payments Agency will be particularly affected by the action. Brits are set to find out how much the price of beer, cigarettes and fuel are changing when Mr Hunt finally reveals his Spring Budget next month. The Chancellor could have billions extra to play thanks to gas price falls — heaping pressure on him to cut tax this year. Tory MPs will urge him to slash the burden because the scaled-back energy support package will cost 90 per cent less next year. A Resolution Foundation think-tank report said the Treasury would be in line for a “big windfall” with the outlook “a little less bleak”. Senior Tory MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith said “We need to start planning for easing the tax burden. “Forecasts of doom and gloom are wrong. “The UK economy is in a robust position. “As we run up to the Budget we should not make the squeeze any worse. “The rise in corporation tax in April will just squeeze the economy even more. “But we do need to start planning for easing the tax burden as it hurts individuals and businesses - and get growth going.” But Mr Hunt signalled last month that any tax cuts would only come “when the time is right” as he tried to dampen speculation.

Rishi Sunak reveals how he’ll ‘cut energy bills’ as analysts predict savings this summer,"RISHI Sunak today insisted his big Whitehall shake-up will make energy bills CHEAPER for Brits. On a visit to power plant in London Kings Cross, the PM said that a new government department dedicated to energy and net zero will also help to halve inflation and make Britain's economy boom.  Mr Sunak said: ""I think we've seen over the last year in particular the impact that happens to people's bills at home when energy policy doesn't work properly, when we're reliant on imported energy from hostile countries. ""That's why the creation today of a new department focused specifically on energy security and net zero is so important. ""It's going to mean that we can reduce people's energy bills - that's so important - it means we can produce more energy here at home, giving us more independence and security, and it means we can transition to cleaner forms of energy as we hit our net zero ambitions and create jobs in the process, as we're seeing here today. ""We're focused on delivering for the British people and this will help us do that."" This morning the PM finally named Greg Hands as a successor to Nadhim Zahawi. At the same time he announced major changes to Whitehall departments. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) will both be broken up. BEIS will turn into a stand­alone Energy Security and Net Zero department, headed by Grant Shapps. Business and Trade will merge under the leadership of Kemi Badenoch. And a new Science, Innovation and Technology unit will also be formed, led by Michelle Donelan. Culture, Media and Sport will become a slimmed-down department after being stripped of the digital brief headed by Lucy Frazer. Mr Sunak pledged to form a standalone Energy department when campaigning to be Tory leader in August last year. No10 wants the UK to be energy independent by 2045 so Brits no longer have to rely on tyrants like Putin for gas and electricity. The shake-up comes as two prestigious economic analysts recently predicted energy bills will start to FALL this summer.  In great news for hard-up households, the Resolution Foundation Foundation think tank predicts bills will fall to £2,200 by October. That's £300 less than the average house hold pays under the current price cap.  Meanwhile, consultancy firm Cornwall Insights think average bills could fall to £2,360 in the coming four months. In November last year forecasters warned ministers average summer bills would hit a staggering £3,500 per year.

Budgeting whizz Cost Of Living Crisis Tips has shared its draught hack in a video online.  They said: “If you have a draught coming through your window cracks.” “Stick a piece of paper in between to stop the cold getting through” For this, you may need to fold the paper a few times to make sure it fits into the size of your gap. It’s also important to bear in mind that the length of your paper may not match the length of your window so you may have to layer pieces of paper on top of each other to block the full draught.  If your child is aged three or four and you live in England. In this instance, you could be due 15 to 30 hours free childcare a week. The childcare must be with an approved childcare provider, such as a registered childminder, nanny or home care worker. It stops once your child starts reception at school, or reaches compulsory school age. You can apply for the help on the government's website online or through your local council. If you don't know who you local council is you can use the government's locator tool found on its website. It's worth noting there are different schemes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Insurance experts A-Plan are encouraging drivers to develop a smooth driving technique which could reduce their petrol usage and save them more money. They said: “Developing a smooth driving technique is a great way to save on fuel. “If you’re approaching traffic lights, for example, slow down early so that they may have changed by the time you reach them, meaning you might not need to stop at all. “Anticipate the road in front of you and ease off the throttle and maintain momentum rather than braking hard and then accelerating again. “Change up and down multiple gears at a time and change to the highest suitable gear as soon as you can to avoid over-revving.” MoneySuperMarket.com MoneySuperMarket's calculator requires you to input how many people are purchasing the house, your income and any guaranteed bonuses. Based on your circumstances, it will tell you how much you should receive and the maximum you're likely to be offered. Which?

The calculator provides an estimate of what you can afford and gives you a figure to show what your monthly repayments might be. Barclay's quick affordability calculator Barclay's calculator asks for the number of applicants, income, regular expenditure, the reason you want a mortgage and the size of your deposit.

However, these are just an estimate, the actual amount will depend on the lender and circumstances. Bear in mind that while house prices have dropped for several consecutive months, lenders are short and interest rates have increased. Rising rates and the cost of living crisis have meant fewer people are looking to buy a home or move home - badly impacting the housing market. If you’re a parent living in the UK and you’re responsible for a child who’s under 16, you can claim child benefit. This benefit is aimed to help you with the costs that come with raising children. With it, you also get National Insurance Credits that count towards your state pension. Parents claim £21.80 a week for their first child and then £14.45 is added for any extra child they’ll have. Payments are usually made every four weeks. Find more information on child benefit here. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/21307627/universal-credit-martin-lewis-money-live-cost-of-living/
National Lottery players issued 24-hour warning as THREE £10k prizes lay unclaimed – don’t lose out,"NATIONAL Lottery players have been issued a 24-hour warning as three £10,000 prizes lie unclaimed. The lucky player of the Lotto's Set For Life can bag themselves the cash prize monthly for one whole year. And three people are yet to claim their winnings from last month. As the 30-day deadline is fast approaching, people who bought a ticket on January 9 are being urged to check their numbers. The winning numbers were 7, 16, 24, 29, 31 and the Life Ball was 3. If you remember putting these on but can't find your ticket, don't panic. Camelot will still pay out if you have lost, destroyed or had your ticket stolen. However, only if a player has submitted a claim in writing within 30 days of the draw date - which is tomorrow. Andy Carter, advisor at The National Lottery, said: ""Wednesday 8 February at 5pm is a key milestone for these three incredible Set For Life unclaimed prizes.  ""Although there are 180 days for any National Lottery winner to come forward with their winning ticket, during the first 30 days after the draw it’s still possible to make a claim in writing to Camelot if the ticket has been lost, destroyed or even eaten by the dog! ""There’s no need to panic if you haven’t got your ticket to hand, but you need to act fast and write to us before this Wednesday. ""Whether these three prizes are one lucky ticket-holder who, for whatever reason, has played the same winning numbers three times or more than one ticket-holder who have happened to have played the same numbers in the same draw, it’s a total of three prizes worth £10,000 a month for one year waiting to be claimed."" Players can check their tickets online or on the National Lottery app.  ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/21308570/national-lottery-players-issued-warning-prizes-unclaimed/
"Free cash worth up to £7,000 for new parents – can you claim?","IF you're a new parent feeling the pinch of rising bills and food costs, you can get up to £7,000 in help.  When factoring in clothes, food, and childcare, it can really cost a lot to look after a family. As high inflation is driving prices of essentials and services up, these costs are becoming even more difficult to afford. But there is a range of support on offer - here's everything you can claim as a new mum or dad. New parents on Universal Credit can get a £500 grant to help with childcare costs through the Sure Start grant. The one-off payment doesn't need to be paid back and it won't reduce your monthly Universal Credit payment or tax credits. The cash can be used to pay for anything that will ease the immediate financial strain on families when caring for a new baby. New parents must have claimed the grant within 11 weeks in advance of their baby's due date or within six months after their child is born. You'll need to print out and fill in a claim form, providing personal details such as your name, address and partner's details if applicable. You will also need to let them know what benefits you're claiming and when you are expecting your baby. A midwife or doctor will need to sign it too to confirm that you are expecting. Only parents who are expecting their first child are eligible for the grant, so if you're about to have your second or third infant then you won't be able to claim the payout. Parents could also get up to £2,000 in childcare help. The government's Tax-Free Childcare scheme means they could get up to £500 help every three months. You could get even more if your child is disabled - totalling £4,000 a year in this case. Your child must be aged under 11, or 17 if they have a disability, to use the scheme. You are also expected to earn over a certain amount at your work over the next three months too. You'll need to earn at least £1,976, which is the National Living Wage for those over 23. Your partner must earn this too. But it's important to note you cannot get tax-free childcare if you're claiming Working Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, Universal Credit or childcare vouchers at the same time. You can only make a claim for Child Tax Credit if you already get Working Tax Credit. If that isn't the case you can get Universal Credit instead. The amount you could get depends on when your children were born. If you have two children born after April 6, 2017, you'd get a child element for each child worth up to £2,935. If you qualified for the maximum, you'd get £5,690 a year. If one child was born before then you could also get a basic amount called the family element worth up to £545 a year. If all your children were born before April 6, 2017, you can claim for all of them, but after that, there is a two-child limit. To claim Child Tax Credit, update your existing tax credit claim by reporting a change in your circumstances online or by phone. You can get Child Benefit worth up to £1,133 a year if you’re responsible for bringing up a child who is under 16 or under 20 if they stay in education. Child benefit is usually paid every four weeks, but you can have the money paid weekly if you’re a single parent or getting certain other benefits like Income Support. If that's the case you can get  You can get the money paid into any account, apart from a Nationwide cash builder account in someone else’s name. You need to apply for child benefit, which you can do online through gov.uk. But only one person can get the benefit for the child or children, so you'll have to decide which parent will get it. The amount you'll get for Child Benefit payments is set to rise in April, so you'll get even more. Just beware of the High Income Child Benefit charge that may start to apply once you start earning a certain amount. If either parent is earning over £50,000 they have to pay the high income child benefit tax charge. This means you pay back 1% of your child benefit for every £100 of income over this amount. Once you reach £60,000 of income you have to repay the full amount. Parents can even claim free cash specifically tailored to covering food costs too. Families are issued vouchers worth £4.25 a week though the Healthy Start Vouchers scheme. And they get double if they have a child under 12 months old. It means parents get £442 in the first year of their baby's life, while pregnant women and families with children between the age of 1 and 4 are given £221 annually. To qualify for the voucher scheme you also need to receive one of the following benefits: But if you are under 18 and pregnant you can get the vouchers, even if you don’t get any of those benefits. New parents can get a range of help including freebies and refunds, on top of the cash benefits they may be able to receive. If you claim Universal Credit, you might be able to get a refund on most of your child care costs. You can claim back 85% of childcare costs up to £646.35 for one child or £1108.04 for two or more up to August 31 following the child’s 16th birthday. You will have to pay your childcare costs yourself up front and then claim the money back through Universal Credit. Prescriptions can cost £8.60 a pop in England, while NHS dental costs vary by location. You can get both for free while you're pregnant and for 12 months after your baby's due date. Ask your doctor or midwife for a maternity exemption certificate (MATEX) to claim the free care. It's not only benefit freebies that you can claim as a new parent. For example parents can get a voucher and exchange it for a pack of Pampers New Baby Carry nappies. Plus, Pampers' customers can download the Pampers Club app and get a free pack of Pampers Baby-Dry every time they buy 10 packs. Do you have a money problem that needs sorting?

"Major update for 8milllion households getting up to £1,350 in cost of living cash from spring","EIGHT million hard-up households will start receiving up to £1,350 in cost of living cash from the Spring. The free cash will be paid directly into bank accounts in multiple instalments after April 6. In total, eight million families on means-tested benefits will automatically qualify for a £900 cost of living payment. This will be paid in three instalments, the first of which will be paid to people's bank accounts soon. An exact date for payments has not yet been revealed but are expected in the new tax year, which starts from April 6. The first instalment is worth £301 and further two payments worth £300 and £299 will follow in the Autumn and Spring of next year. Over 6.5million people on disability benefits in the country will also receive a £150 cost of living payment which will be paid during the summer. Millions of state pensions who are eligible for the Winter Fuel Payment will also qualify for a £300 cost of living payment due next winter.  The Department for Work and Pensions has today released new data which shows the estimated number of households eligible for the £900 cost of living payments: Mel Stride, work and pensions secretary said: ""These direct payments will help people right across the UK over this year and the start of the next, as we continue to provide consistent, targeted and substantial support for the most vulnerable."" Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, added: ""These payments are the next part of the significant support we are providing through this challenging time, with millions of vulnerable households receiving £900 directly into their bank accounts this financial year alongside additional help for pensioners and those with disabilities.""  The £900 payment will be going to millions on means-tested benefits - you'll only be able to get it if you are claiming one of these benefits below. You'll need to be entitled or later found to be entitled to one of these benefits by a certain date. Those eligible for cost of living payments through tax credits, and no other means-tested benefits, will be paid by HMRC shortly after DWP payments are made. You'll need to be in receipt of one of the following disability benefits to qualify for the £150 cost of living payment: Payments will begin in the summer when more detail about the scheme is released by the DWP. Millions of pensioners will also receive another £300 cost of living payment in the winter of 2023/24. This follows from last year's help which was given to households who normally get the Winter Fuel Payment. Households qualified for the previous Pensioner Cost of Living payment if: Eligible individuals will not need to apply for payments, as they are made automatically. More details on the scheme will be released in due course. Millions are entitled to benefits that they aren't claiming and which can make them eligible for the £900 cost of living payment. The quickest way to see what benefits you may be able to claim is to use one of the three benefit calculators recommended by Gov.UK. Each one is free to use. They are:  Before using the tools, make sure you have key financial information to hand, such as bank and savings statements, and information on pensions and existing benefits. If you live with a partner or family, get their basic financial information together too as this could affect your claim. For each of these, you’ll be asked information about your circumstances, such as your current employment and income. You’ll also need to give information about yourself, including your age and who you live with. You can then use the contact information on Gov.UK to get the ball rolling and apply for what you're owed. Of course, the tools only provide an indicator of what benefits you can claim - and usually don't include means-tested benefits, so you may be entitled to even more.

How does AI work and is it always right?,"EVERYBODY seems to be talking about how AI is going to change the world - but what on Earth is it?  The technology has rapidly advanced over the past few months, leading many to scrub up their knowledge of it.  AI stands for artificial intelligence and it lets computers to act in a more 'human' way.  This includes being able to hold conversations - both casual and intellectually challenging ones - with humans.  Computer scientist John McCarthy, one of the founders of AI as a concept, put it like this: ""It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.  ""It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable."" AI can analyse a vast amount of data at speeds that are impossible for human minds.  It can be trained, as well as learn.  The basis of AI is machine learning, which relies on models using maths, statistics and classification methods.  Developers will teach the computer to understand classification methods, which means the AI can spot patterns and make groups of particular things.  A machine with in-built AI can learn from its interactions with human users, individual data sets and the internet.  All it needs to do first is it understand the learning process, and developers will program this understanding into the machine.   Today, AI can help doctors diagnose patients, pilots fly commercial aircrafts and city planners predict traffic. While it can do these things well, this doesn't mean it is always right.  An AI bot is typically smarter than the average person, but it has been developed by humans - meaning it can be susceptible to human error and bias.  AI bias can see a computer make decisions based on training data which can reflect human biases like social inequalities.  In 2018, Amazon stopped using a hiring algorithm when it discovered the AI favoured applications based on words like ""executed"" or ""captured"" - which were more commonly found on the CVs of men.  Technically, no.  While it gives users the impression it is artificially intelligent, Siri is a digital voice assistant.  Siri cannot learn from its past decisions, and use those memories to inform new choices.  The Apple assistant can instead deploy a range of pre-installed options to best help users with their requests.  Looking for tips and hacks for your phone?

What is chatbot Bard and how do I use it?,"THE AI chatbot scene is heating up after Google revealed details about a ChatGPT competitor. ChatGPT has taken the world by storm because of its clever ability to hold natural conversations, as well as writing near-perfect speeches, songs and essays. Google is reportedly alarmed by the rapid rise and public cut-through that ChatGPT has achieved. On top of that, Microsoft - a heavy investor in the project - now looks set to integrate it with Bing. That could pose a real threat Google Search, the tech giant's prized jewel. And so, Google has introduced Bard. Read all about it below. Bard is the name of Google's AI chatbot. It will rely on Google's own conversational language tool, known as Lamda. But crucially it will use Google's search engine to get the information it needs to create responses - which could be a huge advantage. Bard has not been released publicly yet. But Google is expected to reveal details about it at a major event in Paris on February 8. The tech firm has already said a select group of testers will be able to use it first. Then it will become ""more widely available to the public in the coming weeks"". Bard will be free for people to use. However, it apparently costs the firm itself a few pennies each time somebody has a go with it. According to Google boss Sundar Pichai Bard ""seeks to combine the breadth of the world's knowledge with the power, intelligence, and creativity of our large language models"". ""Soon, you'll see AI-powered features in Search that distil complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats, so you can quickly understand the big picture and learn more from the web.""

Millions of iPhone owners urged to learn three hacks to save you from ‘lockout’ nightmare,"FORGETTING your iPhone's passcode is a complete nightmare most of us try to avoid. But for whatever reason, it still catches the best of us out. However, it doesn't render your iPhone useless. There are some ways you may be able to get back in and retain everything. And the very worst case scenario is that you do an entire reset. Here are three options worth considering. According to Apple Insider, PassFab iPhone Unlock is a good way to get around an iPhone lock out. It can bypass your device's passcode so you can regain access. And all without losing any of your data. You'll need to install the software from PassFab's website on a PC or Mac, then plug your iPhone into it for the service to work. We haven't tried it ourselves, so always be sure to do your own research and look for reviews. iCloud's Find My feature can be used to regain access to your locked iPhone. But there's one huge caveat - you'll lose all the data stored on it. If you're sure you wish to proceed, go to iCloud.com and sign into your Apple ID (assuming you haven't forgotten that too). Select your iPhone, followed by Erase iPhone. Another way to get onto your locked iPhone is Recovery Mode - but once again, this will wipe everything. Just plug it into your PC or Mac computer. Before doing that, turn off the iPhone and then plug it in. Now, hold down on the power button. Find the iPhone listed in Finder (if on a Mac) or iTunes. An option for Restore should be displayed.

Sadist cop David Carrick seen posing with guns and porn as teenager in the Army as monster is caged for 30 years,"SADISTIC cop David Carrick was caged for at least 30 years yesterday for a “relentless” rape campaign — as we reveal unseen pictures of him as a gun-obsessed former soldier. The beast, who behaved as if he were “untouchable” and took “monstrous advantage” of his victims, is shown at 19 posing with his army rifle in front of a collage of naked women. As manipulative Carrick, 48 — who hid behind the power of his job to exploit women for almost 20 years — begins his sentence, one victim said: “I hope he dies in prison.” Carrick, who served in the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment and the Royal Logistics Corps before joining the Met, was handed 36 life sentences. While on tour in Cyprus, Carrick, who was convicted of 49 offences against 12 women, posed with guns and in a martial arts stance. The pictures were sent to a woman penpal, who remembered him as an “aloof and arrogant” man who pretended he was an “elite soldier” heading for the special forces. Carrick, of Stevenage, Herts, was watched on video-link by some of his victims for yesterday’s sentencing at Southwark crown court. He had come to the attention of police nine times before he was finally arrested and charged. Judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb told him: “Behind a public appearance of propriety and trustworthiness you took monstrous advantage of women drawn into intimate relationships with you. “You brazenly raped and sexually assaulted many women, some you barely knew. You behaved as if you were untouchable. “You were bold and at times relentless, trusting that no victim would overcome her shame and fear to report you. For nearly two decades you were proved right.” One victim abused by Carrick for four years said: “He deserves to die in prison. He will rot behind bars. “He’s an evil, evil monster. He could’ve killed any of us. What he did to us was disgusting. When they read the impact statements I realised how similar our stories were.” The woman, who met Carrick on a dating app, added: “I don’t think I’ll ever be able to have another relationship. He’s ruined that for me. “The Met have a lot to answer for. They missed nine opportunities to stop him but let him stay in the police for so many years.” She praised the woman whose complaint to police led to Carrick’s arrest at home, body-cam footage of which was released by cops. She said: “If it wasn’t for her none of us would’ve come forward. He’d still be working. We owe her a lot.” Met Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said the force “let down women” and called Carrick’s crimes “unspeakably evil”. He said: “We missed opportunities to identify the warning signs. We’re truly sorry.” Ruth Davison, CEO of domestic violence charity Refuge, said: “That Carrick could remain a serving officer for so long while he perpetrated this gross abuse of power and horrific crimes . . .  is terrifying.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21309213/rapist-david-carrick-posing-guns-porn-teenager-army/
Bird flu warning after geese die in park & RSPCA tells of deaths across the UK,"A BIRD flu warning has been issued after a number of dead geese were found in a park. It comes as the RSCPA says a ""high number"" of sick and dying birds are being reported across the UK. In Rochdale, Greater Manchester, people who use Queen's Park have been told to stay away from ill and dead birds after several dead geese were spotted. Dog walkers have also been urged to keep their pets away from the featured critters in the area. According to Rochdale Council, no cases of avian flu have been identified in Queens's Park yet but the issue is being investigated, reports Manchester Evening News. But in Alexandra Park in Oldham, also in Greater Manchester, a bird flu outbreak has been confirmed after several dead birds were found - forcing the closure of its boating lake. The RSCPA says officers have visited Queen's Park to deal ""with the sad situation"". A spokesman for the charity said: ""Unfortunately high numbers of sick and dying birds are being reported across the UK due to the ongoing and severe UK-wide avian flu outbreak, which is continuing to spread through bird populations.  ""It's been devastating for the RSPCA - and wildlife lovers across the country - to see birds perish from this awful disease. “Avian flu can be carried by all bird species, but seabirds, waterfowl and birds of prey are the most common species reported.  ""This is a highly contagious disease within birds and it’s important to take all precautions to stop its spread. “The UK Government continues to advise not to touch or pick up any dead or visibly sick birds that you find.  ""If you have already touched the bird, please wash your hands immediately, along with any surfaces you may have made contact with.   “For more information, please check our online advice about what to do if you find a sick or injured bird.

It comes after experts told The Sun bird flu could spill over to humans and new vaccines should be developed. Concerns the virus could have a potentially devastating impact were raised after its spread to otters and foxes in Britain was revealed last week. The animals are believed to have eaten dead wild birds that were infected with the virus, which is currently at record levels in the UK.

Energy giant BP under fire for record £23bn profits as it slashes green targets,"ENERGY giant BP came under fire yesterday for posting record profits while slashing environmental targets. The firm reported that profits doubled in 2022 to £23billion — the highest figure in its 114 years. It handed shareholders a £3.6billion dividend for a year in which consumers faced record home energy bills. TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said: “As millions struggle to heat their homes and put food on the table, BP is laughing all the way to the bank. “Hard-pressed families will rightly feel furious — they are being treated like cash machines.” In response to calls for the Government to increase windfall tax on energy giants, No10 said: “We will continue to discuss with all of these companies about ways they can reinvest some of these profits. “We have set up the tax system so that the more investment the firm makes into the UK, the less tax they will pay.” BP boss Bernard Looney said the British firm was “helping provide the energy the world needs” while investing in moving to green energy. But it has slashed its environmental targets and is now aiming for a 20 to 30 per cent cut in emissions by the end of the decade compared with its previous 35 to 40 per cent. BP said its oil and gas production will be around two million barrels of oil equivalent a day by 2030.  While that is 25 per cent lower than in 2019, its previous target was a 40 per cent cut. Climate campaign group Greenpeace said BP’s new strategy “seems to have been strongly undermined by pressure from investors and governments to make even more dirty money out of oil and gas”. Mr Looney said: “We need continuing near-term investment into today’s energy system, which depends on oil and gas, to meet demands.” Last week oil rival Shell reported its highest ever profit of £33billion. With US giants Chevron and ExxonMobil, the majors have now announced joint profits of around £134billion. GROCER LIDL says shoppers trying to save money have boosted sales by nearly £11million last month — about £120million in the past year . Consumers switched to the German-owned supermarket away from premium chains such as M&S, Waitrose and Sainsbury’s. Lidl said its high-quality fresh produce was a big attraction to customers and helped its share of the fruit and vegetable market climb to a record 10.2 per cent. It recently added a fruit and veg virtual stamp promotion to its app. Boss of the company’s British arm Ryan McDonnell said: “It’s clear that a lot of shoppers are now refusing to pay a premium for their groceries.” Analysis of shopping lists across the nation published last week by The Grocer magazine suggested Lidl was £10.31 cheaper than Sainsbury’s and £24.82 cheaper than Waitrose, although discount rival Aldi was named the UK’s cheapest supermarket. Mr McDonnell added: “We know people switch to us to make savings but they stay when they realise that they’re not having to compromise on quality.” The chain now has 950 stores across the UK. MANUFACTURER Morgan Advanced Materials has been hit by a cyber attack which it warned would cost £12million to put right. The British firm said it had been forced to use manual transactions at some sites while it repairs IT systems.  The components firm said: “During January sites experienced a delay in restarting production and shipping.” Shares in the components company fell five per cent. Fund manager HL Select, said: “Recovering from cyber attacks can be complex.” THE average house price is now more than £12,000 below August’s peak, according to Halifax. The typical property now costs £281,684, the lender said. Prices remained flat in January but still climbed 1.9 per cent over the year. BREWER Carlsberg says it could raise beer prices in some regions. The Danish drinks giant said that “while beer historically has been a resilient consumer category” recent cost rises could squeeze profits. It warned that 2023 “will be another challenging year” due to supply and energy rises. However organic revenue grew 15.6 per cent in 2022 compared with 2021, driven by higher pricing as volumes sales grew 5.7 per cent. Sales of its Carlsberg brand climbed 14 per cent globally. UK bank chiefs were blasted by MPs yesterday for putting profits before customers. Bosses at Lloyds, NatWest, HSBC and Barclays — who collectively earn more than £10million a year — were hauled before a Treasury select committee. They were accused of closing branches while paying paltry interest rates. MPs said their constituents complained that mortgage rates rose more quickly and accused banks of relying on inertia to ensure customers remain on poor savings rates. Barclays chief Matt Hammerstein said: “I definitely refute the idea.”  NatWest boss Alison Rose said: “Only one in four people have £100 of savings in their account.” HSBC chief Ian Stuart said the bank is “absolutely committed to a physical footprint in the UK” but added: “Customer behaviours started to change in 1982 with the advent of the cash machine.” AIRCRAFT maker Boeing is axing 2,000 workers in its aerospace company’s finance and human resources departments in 2023. It said it will outsource about a third of the office roles to Tata Consulting Service. However, the firm plans to boost engineering and manufacturing roles this year. On top of the 15,000 people it hired last year the company said it aims to recruit another 10,000 in 2023. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/21309049/energy-bp-record-profits-23billion/
Martin Lewis Money Show: Expert issues water bills warning and reveals how to get money off yours,"MARTIN Lewis has told how Brits can get money off their water bill. Households will see the largest hike in their annual water bills in nearly 20 years when they rise to an average of £448 this spring. Water UK said the 7.5 per cent increase would see customers pay around £1.23 per day on average, from April in England and Wales. This is an increase of 8p per day, or an average of £31 more than last year’s charges. However, money expert Lewis has revealed the ways Brits can slash their bills. The founder of Money Saving Expert has explained if you live in England or Wales a free water meter is likely to cut your costs. He told how one person cut their water bill by a staggering £400 by fitting a water meter. And Brits should use the Water Meter Calculator to see how different elements of their daily water use can be reduced to potentially make further savings. He also says anyone who has a disability or on benefits should contact their water firm to see if they are eligible for a discount. There are a number of ways you can slash your water bills in 2023. Meanwhile moving to a water meter could help some save some extra cash. However, if you do use a lot of water then it makes no sense to have a meter as your bills could go up. The Consumer Council for Water offers a free water meter calculator that'll tell you if you can save by fitting a water meter.

Inside ‘complex’ Nicola Bulley search as cops probe 500 active lines of inquiry and track down 700 cars in area,"POLICE today revealed the extent of their ""complex"" search for missing mum Nicola Bulley. Nicola, 45, was last seen in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, at around 9.15am on January 27. Since then, there has been no trace of the mum with search efforts ramping up today. Police, coastguard and private divers have been desperately searching for evidence that may indicate what happened to Nicola for twelve painstaking days. And today cops revealed the details surrounding the mammoth inquiry. In a press conference, Supt Sally Riley explained the huge amount of effort being put into finding the missing mum. She said: “At the moment there are around 500 active pieces of information and lines of inquiry that they are working on to try and find answers for Nicola’s family. “We have a team of 40 or so detectives under a senior investigating officer working daily to comb through this enormous amount of information. “This is normal in a missing person enquiry and does not indicate that there is any suspicious element to this story. “The enquiry team remains fully open minded to any information that may indicate where Nicola is or what happened to her.” Supt Riley said the force has not yet detected a ""suspicious"" element in Nicola's disappearance. She added: ""Every third party element or criminal element has been looked into and discounted."" Officers are speaking to the drivers of 700 vehicles that drove through the village at around 9.10am/9.15am on the morning Nicola vanished. Supt Riley said the search is ""complex"" as the river can be fast-moving with parts of the water tidal. She added: ""It remains our belief that Nicola fell into the river and that this is a missing person inquiry."" It comes after the head of the specialist dive squad searching for Nicola said it is ""unlikely"" she will be found in the river after searching ""large areas"" for two days. Peter Faulding of SGI also claimed it is “impossible” that her body could have reached the sea. He told GB News: “We've been using the high frequency side scan sonar in this stretch today and it's so detailed I can even see every stone of it. She's not in this stretch. “We also sonar-ed on the other side down yesterday in the tidal river.  ""Now if you take a football on a tidal river…when the tide goes out the the ball will go down the stream and then as soon as the tide turns it will come back in again.  ""It'll end up back at the same place. “For Nicola to get out to the sea would be impossible, literally, it is such a long way.” Supt Sally Riley claimed there may have been an “issue” with dog Willow that led Nicola to the edge of the water. Officers yesterday revealed more about Nicola's final movements as they issued an update on her disappearance. They said she did not leave the field where she was walking Willow via Rowanwater, either through the site itself or via the piece of land at the side. Nicola also did not return to the fields along Allotment Lane or via the path at the rear of the Grapes pub onto Garstang Road. Officers are now focusing on a river path that leads from the fields back to Garstang Road and are appealing for drivers to come forward. Anyone who travelled down the road on that day will also receive a letter from police requesting dashcam footage. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21310516/inside-complex-nicola-bulley-search/
"Little girl is born and pulled from debris of Turkey quake amid fears that 20,000 people died","A BABY born under the rubble of a flattened town is carried to safety yesterday — giving rescuers a flicker of hope amid the aftermath of an earthquake feared to have killed up to 20,000 people. The girl, with her umbilical cord still attached, was pulled from the debris of Jenderes, in Syria. Tragically her mother was reported to have died shortly after giving birth while trapped for more than 24 hours. In neighbouring Turkey, forlorn Mesut Hancer sat holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter Irmak.  She had died in the city of Kahramanmaras, her fingers reaching in vain from the wreckage of their home. Locals had dug frantically with pneumatic drills, angle grinders and then with their bare hands. But it was too late.  Irmak was among more than 5,000 victims already confirmed dead after a 7.8 magnitude quake, the biggest since 1939. In cities across the stricken area — such as Antakya in the south of Turkey — the dead were placed on the pavements as relatives raced to find their loved ones. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has declared a three-month state of emergency in the quake’s epicentre, Gaziantep, and nine other cities. In the harbour city of Iskenderen, the sky turned black as hundreds of shipping containers caught fire. In Diyarbakir, a city of 1.8million in central Turkey, rescuers battled to find survivors in a collapsed eight-storey block of flats. Dozens of hard-hat wearing emergency workers kept breaking off to put their ears to the twisted metal, but were met by deathly silence. One rescue worker said: “The flats collapsed like a wedding cake. People were asleep inside.” Amid terrifying aftershocks, which threaten to flatten remaining buildings, a resident said: “I’ve barely slept since the first quake hit. None of us has.” A global rescue effort is in full swing, with Britain’s development minister Andrew Mitchell pledging to do everything to help. He said: “Britain is always there first and in strength to help when these appalling catastrophes take place. And we will be there this time.” A team of 76 search and rescue specialists with four sniffer dogs have already been dispatched from the UK. But rescue efforts were hampered by further quakes as well as falling snow and freezing temperatures.  More than 13million people are believed to have been effected. James Elder, of kids charity Unicef, said the quakes “may have killed thousands of children”. Often even apparent chinks of light merely mask a family tragedy. Toddler Raghad Ismail was dragged from the rubble bloodied and dazed in Azaz a town in rebel-held northern Syria.  Later the 18 month-old was seen chewing on a piece of bread as she sat under a blanket in the winter cold. Yet her uncle Abu Hussam revealed: “The father is feared to have his back broken, his young daughter is fine. “His pregnant wife, his five-year-old daughter and his four-year-old son have all been killed.” The father is feared to have his back broken, his young daughter is fine. His pregnant wife, his five-year-old daughter and his four-year-old son have all been killed. Families have had heartbreaking exchanges with trapped loved ones. Desperate Nurgul Atay, from Antakya, said that she could hear her mum’s voice beneath a collapsed building but no heavy equipment was available to free her.  Nurgul added: “If only we could lift the concrete slab we’d be able to reach her. “My mother is 70-years-old. She won’t be able to withstand this for long.” Footage emerged of a resident hearing a woman’s voice pleading for help. In the darkness, the man says: “As you see, there is a dead body here. He is dead and nobody has removed him. And a woman’s voice is heard from underneath.” The woman is again heard crying out and banging on metal but the resident is unable to help without heavy machinery. Some of those buried alive have sent harrowing voice messages.  Turkish journalist Ibrahim Haskologlu said he had been sent videos pleading for help. The Istanbul-based reporter added: “They’re telling us where they are and yet we can’t do anything.” Thousands of Turks from the north of the country are flying to the stricken south to work as volunteers — while others are comforted by cabin crew as they travel to pay their last respects to loved ones. The huge first quake struck at 4.17am on Monday as a winter storm raged, leaving a trail of destruction stretching for hundreds of miles along Turkey’s border with Syria. It was followed by a slightly less powerful 7.5-magnitude quake on Monday afternoon and then a 5.6 magnitude quake yesterday. There have been more than 285 aftershocks leaving residents terrified more buildings will topple. As well as over 5,000 confirmed deaths, at least 20,426 are so far reported injured with at least 11,302 buildings destroyed. Search teams have already pulled more than 8,000 people from the rubble.  A further 380,000 have been forced to seek refuge in mosques, shopping malls and sports stadiums. Collapsed roads and bridges are also hindering emergency services.  The highway connecting Gaziantep and Adana in southern Turkey — two of the worst affected cities — has been sliced in two in one section by the force of the quakes.  Foreign Secretary James Cleverly told the House of Commons yesterday that three Britons are missing in the disaster zone. He added that 35 British nationals are being offered support. Andrew Lee, professor of public health at the University of Sheffield, said: “The full scale of the disaster will not be clear for a few days yet, and the total number of casualties will probably increase. “The risk of further aftershocks remains, and damaged buildings pose a further hazard.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21309723/daughter-born-turkey-quake/
Jeremy Hunt warned troops risk turning into ‘cannon fodder’ unless he spends billions more on the Army,"CHANCELLOR Jeremy Hunt has been warned troops risk turning into “cannon fodder” unless he spends billions more on the Army. The Treasury and ­MoD are at loggerheads over next month’s Budget. Insiders say Mr Hunt is prepared to replenish £2.3billion of military stockpiles — including tanks and guns — handed to Ukraine last year to fight the Russian invaders. And he could find £300million to reverse plans to reduce the Army to just 73,000-strong, its smallest size for 300 years. But one Ministry of Defence source yesterday branded that a “sticking plaster PR stunt that would produce sub-par fighters”. They continued: “Without proper investment to go alongside extra troops, you risk turning them into cannon ­fodder.  ""They need the kit, the vehicles and the training — and that costs money.” Defence Secretary Ben ­Wallace has warned Downing Street risks missing a Nato promise to spend two per cent of GDP on the armed forces each year unless it hikes the current £48.4billion budget. A Treasury source insisted: “The PM and Chancellor ­recognise the need to increase defence spending further, subject to the ongoing Integrated Review.”

BBC boss blasts the TV licence fee as a ‘regressive’ tax,"THE BBC’s chairman has blasted the TV licence fee as a “regressive” tax. Richard Sharp yesterday admitted the £159 annual charge penalised the poor, women and pensioners. The Corporation’s chairman was asked by MPs if he still believed the telly tax funding model was the “least worst option”. Mr Sharp replied: “There are issues with the licence. “It’s regressive. In some ways it’s considered anachronistic because there are other countries that adopt other mechanisms. “And there are a number of issues in terms of how we collect the licence fee for pensioners and also issues arising from people’s failure to pay the licence for example, with respect to gender issues, so it is imperfect.” Campaigners argue women are overwhelmingly prosecuted over non-payment as they are usually at home when enforcers call. The government is carrying out a review of the Beeb’s funding, including whether a mandatory fee — which has been frozen for two years — is best. Mr Sharp agreed the BBC must “contribute to that discussion when it arises”. Rebecca Ryan, of Defund the BBC, said: “It is welcome to hear Richard Sharp admit significant issues with the TV licence.  ""People should not be forced to pay, through discriminatory practices, for an organisation out of touch with vast swathes of the country.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21310494/bbc-boss-blast-tv-tax-unfair/
Shamima Begum Story: Viewers slam BBC for giving Jihadi bride 1hr30-long programme & threaten to cancel licences,"VIEWERS have slammed the BBC for giving airtime to Jihadi bride Shamima Begum in a one hour 30-minute long doc. Many Brits have also threatened to cancel their TV licences after tonight's showing of Shamima's story.  The now 23-year-old doesn't believe she should be prosecuted for being a member of ISIS. Despite wanting to return to the UK, she said travelling to Syria nearly 10 years ago was ""exciting"".  The broadcaster has now been blasted for being ""disgraceful"" after she appeared on people's televisions in a fresh bid to get the country on her side. Taking to Twitter, one user said: ""Why are you giving Shamima Begum airtime?  ""She is a terrorist who was complicit in the deaths of many innocent people."" Another added: ""Why are the BBC giving Shamima Begum, a terrorist by association, airtime on our TV’s?  ""Disgusting and utterly disgraceful!"" Meanwhile a third wrote: ""[The] BBC are a disgrace too for airing this b******s, TV license for this they can both get f****d."" Another also questioned why their TV licence fee was being spent on broadcasting the ""terrorist animal"". They said: ""@BBC how dare you spend my licence fee to showcase the story of the terrorist animal who is Shamima Begum.  ""Absolutely disgusting!! Wish I could cancel my TV licence."" Shamima is currently living at Al-Roj prison camp following the collapse of ISIS ""Caliphate"". Refusing to accept responsibility for ""other people's actions"", the young woman said the terrorist acts carried out by the group would have happened regardless of her journey. She was just 15 when she and two school pals snuck away from Bethnal Green, East London, in February 2015. She told the BBC2 doc, in an interview monitored by Kurdish authorities, she was ""in love"" with ISIS and desperate to join. The ISIS bride explained how she flew from Gatwick to Istanbul, where an ISIS handler waited with them for a bus. Shamima claimed she didn't know about the ""atrocities"" connected to the terrorist group when she fled the country. However, even after watching horrific execution videos she didn't change her mind about joining. She said: ""I just thought, there's no turning back. I've already done it, I might as well see it through."" She has begged to be allowed to return to the UK and has appealed against a decision to strip her of British citizenship. Supporters claim she is a victim of trafficking - but the government says she went to Syria with her ""eyes wide open"" and is a danger to society. Previous reports have claimed she was a member of the brutal ISIS religious police, carried an AK-47 on street patrols and sewed suicide bombers into their explosive vests. She denies all the claims in the new BBC doc, claiming she was ""just a housewife"" who was rarely allowed outside. However the film also reveals Shamima lived for seven months with a mysterious Egyptian who allegedly supplied ISIS with weapons. The ISIS bride claims she did not know his name - but also hails him as a ""father figure"" and says she does not believe he was a notorious arms dealer. It is one of several scenes where she appears reluctant to admit the truth. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21310260/shamima-begum-story-viewers-slam-bbc/
"Violent rapist, 31, who claimed to be Tyson Fury’s ‘cousin’ and forced victims to eat their own poo is jailed","A VIOLENT rapist who claimed to be Tyson Fury's cousin and forced his victims to eat their own poo, has been jailed. The ""monster"" David Overton, 31, seduced three victims before sexually assaulting them. Overton's violent affairs began when he ditched his fake multi millionaire persona and reinvented himself a ""Davy Fury"". The conman used steroids to help bulk up and began falsely claiming he was the boxing champ's relative - which his mother soon rubbished. In reality, he grew up on a council estate in Congleton, Cheshire, and had a previous conviction for fraud.  He has today been given 27 years for his horrific acts against women. One woman was forced to eat faeces and drink urine after being subjected to traumatising sex ordeals. Another one of Overton's victims was raped at a hotel after a charity function. The third was forced to have sex with Overton after he headbutted her. Cops say he controlled the women’s finances, took out loans in their names and manipulated them into handing over their savings. In a statement one of the victims said she suffers flashbacks and wish Overton had killed her. The statement read: “Initially David saw himself as a character inspired by the Wolf of Wall Street but then he created this new Fury character. ''What this man put me through is by far the worst thing I have ever experienced.  ""I was used for my money so he could carry out some sick twisted fantasy. “The bruises may fade but the psychological scars never will. ""Even when I sleep he still towers over me, all 6”5 of him. He is a monster in size and a monster in nature.  ""I suffer flashbacks whilst washing up and cleaning the house and sometimes I wish he did kill me. ''This man is no Tyson Fury - he has no regard for any human or animal. His next victim may not be so lucky.” Another victim said: “I changed my hairstyle so that my new fringe covers the permanent forehead scar that David gave me.  ""I used to be such an extrovert but now I am the complete opposite.'' The third woman said in a statement: ''I can’t count on my fingers the number if times he threatened to shoot me, my family and friends.  ""I was so scared when he said that he was going to need a body bag and a clean-up crew to come to my address. ''He would punch, kick and shout at me and then I would get told off for flinching.  ""Even my dog was affected by what he did will need training to correct his behaviour.” At Chester Crown Court, Overton, from Macclesfield, was convicted of 25 offences including 13 counts of rape and four counts of sexual assault. He was also found guilty of three counts of controlling and coercive behaviour, three counts of actual bodily harm, one count of sexual touching and possession of a knife. Sentencing Judge Michael Leeming said he posed as a risk to women in the future. He said: ''All three women allowed you into their lives and in return you treated them with sustained violence and abuse.  ""You yourself admitted you were a control freak - but insisted that you always respected women. “However these were not respectful actions and in your words, these women were no match for you.  ""The trust, confidence and faith in human nature these victims once had would have not been damaged were it not for your relationships with them. ”You do show clear tropes of narcissism and are a compulsive liar.  ""You pose a significant risk of harm to women and any future women you have relationships with.” David Polglase, prosecuting, described Overton as a ""violent and manipulative bully"". He said: ''He appears to have been engaging and wildly generous to start, but also soon showed various darker traits, and was not honest about his background, including playing on supposed links to Tyson Fury. ''His behaviour was coercive, controlling, violent and descended into sexual offending.  ""All three victims describe sexual activity based on, at best submission or acquiescence and at worst violence, fear and coercion. ''The defendant is a violent and manipulative bully. He is someone who has to be in control of a situation. He is a fantasist.  ""He is a man who wants his own way. He is a man who does not take ‘no’ for an answer.  ""He has shown that to be that kind of person, with no respect for women, by the three complainants in this case.'' ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21311011/violent-rapist-forced-victims-eat-poo/
Heartbroken grandparents of 3 young children stabbed in horror rampage speak out for first time after visit to hospital,"The GRANDPARENTS of three young children found stabbed in a house have told of their shock after visiting them in hospital. The girl, four, boy, two, and three-month-old boy were found with serious stab wounds in Huddersfield on Monday. The baby and the young girl are being treated for non-life-threatening injuries, Meanwhile, 34-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. Now the kids’ grandad has recalled the moment he was told of their injuries.  He told Yorkshire Live: “My wife woke me up yesterday morning.  “Her brother had been in touch to say ‘something has happened to the grandchildren’.  “We are all in shock, really shocked.

The children are OK, they’re recovering.  “As long as they’re OK, that’s all that matters.” Terrified neighbours yesterday told of shock after hearing screams coming from the home. Natalia Skorek, 23, who lives a few doors away from the address, said: “My mum heard some screaming around 7am. “But we thought it was the neighbours on the other side because they have kids and sometimes hear them shouting. “So we didn’t think anything of it. “It was only later we found what had happened.” Another neighbour, who didn’t wish to be named, said the woman had lived at the address with her husband for around two years and they had three children. She said: “I think the husband is a taxi driver. “One of the children is just a few months old, the other two are older.” Detective Chief Inspector Sam Freeman said: “We continue to carry out extensive enquiries into this incident which resulted in three children suffering serious injuries this morning. “A woman continues to be treated for injuries and remains under arrest in hospital. ""Based on our investigations so far, we are not seeking anyone else in connection with what has taken place.” He added: “Officers continue to support the family involved at what is clearly a dreadful time for them. “I would like to remind residents that this case involves very young children and ask that their privacy is respected and members of the public avoid unhelpful speculation which can only increase distress for the family involved.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21311076/grandparents-three-kids-stabbed-shock/
"I fell 50ft down a waterfall and broke my back, leg and ankle… it was a miracle I survived","A HIKER survived a 50ft tumble down a waterfall — despite “hitting every rock on the way down”. Gerry McLelland, 39, suffered a broken back, leg and ankle in his fall. The dad of one slipped at Grey Mare’s Tail on a hike in the Scottish Borders. After the first fall, he was pinned underwater as he raced towards another 60ft drop which would almost certainly have killed him. He said: “I was thinking, ‘I’m going to die, I’m going to die’. I had to accept this was my time.  ""I stopped fighting and let myself go. That saved me because the current pushed me away from the waterfall. It gave me a split second to grab something.” He was able to pull himself from the water but saw his foot was twisted the wrong way round. The pals he was with called for help and he was winched up into a rescue helicopter. Gerry spent five nights in hospital in Glasgow but is now recuperating at his parents’ home in Wishaw, North Lanarkshire. The engineer said he was still virtually bed-bound and expected to be off work for six months, adding: “I’m here, I’m alive. I just remind myself that every day is going to be better.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21310816/fell-50ft-waterfall-miracle-survived/
Inside hunt for £4million ‘treasure trove’ hidden on ‘gold rush’ shipwreck discovered after 150 years,"SHIPWRECK hunters are scouring the bottom of the ocean for £4 million worth of treasure that sank with a boat almost 150 years ago. Gold-rush steamer SS Pacific vanished beneath the waves in 1875 while sailing from Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, to San Francisco, in the US state of California. At the time, the Cassiar Gold Rush was sweeping northern BC, and the Pacific was loaded with some £149,000 of gold – an estimated £4 million in today’s money. But she collided with the sailing ship, Orpheus, and sank with her entire cargo – and the loss of some 325 souls – south of Cape Flattery, Washington. It was the deadliest maritime disaster in the history of the western US. Almost 150 years on Matthew McCauley and Jeff Hummel, two experts from the Northwest Shipwreck Alliance, believe they’ve found the lost ship. Philip Drew, the group's spokesman, said in December: “The discovery was more of a slow realisation than an a-ha moment. “The site required close and repeated examination with side scan sonar lines and remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) dives to gather enough data and evidence. “Jeff Hummel and the team haven't had much time to take a step back and enjoy the moment yet. The holidays will provide an opportunity for us all to slow down and celebrate. ""We're also very much connected to the stories of all those who perished on the fateful day in 1875 which tempers our celebration of this discovery. ""And there's still years of hard work ahead to excavate the wreck, taking the appropriate care to recover and preserve artifacts."" One of the telltale signs was the discovery of two circular depressions in the seabed, a short distance from the rest of the wreck. These are thought to be the steamer’s paddle wheels. Mr Drew said: “Historical accounts describe the Pacific partially breaking up at the surface, so we expected to find paddle wheels independent from the rest of the ship. “Sure enough, we were able to image both paddle wheels with sonar and view the uncovered portion of them with the ROV in a nearby debris field.” The team haven't made the precise location of the wreck public, though a judge granted exclusive salvage rights. But they gave a rough location, saying it lies some 23 miles offshore at a depth of between 1,000 and 2,000ft. The team hopes to open a museum dedicated to artifacts recovered from the wreck, though there will be a window of time for descendants to assert ownership in court. Mr Drew said: “For our region of the world – the west coast of the US – the Pacific represents the most deadly maritime disaster in our history. “We also believe the wreck is in an incredible state of preservation and so we expect and hope that the artifacts we recover will have considerable historical significance.” The Pacific was captained by Jefferson Davis Howell, who commanded a rebel gunboat in the US Civil War, and whose brother-in-law, Jefferson Davis, was former Confederate President. Only two people survived the disaster; he was among the dead. Others aboard included some of the elite of the Pacific Northwest, gold miners going home for winter and 41 people identified only as “Chinamen”. Since children didn’t pay to sail, they were likely undercounted, and a number of additional passengers had rushed aboard at the last moment without buying a ticket. No human remains have been detected at the wreck site yet, and its discoverers think it’s unlikely any will be, given the depth of the water and the strong currents in the area. The Orpheus, which survived the initial collision, had steered into the Pacific’s path after its second mate mistook her lights for those of the Cape Flattery lighthouse. She too wrecked later that night, though her crew made it ashore. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21311022/hunt-treasure-trove-gold-rush-shipwreck/
Dodgy business deals with national security concerns to be probed amid government shake-up,"DODGY business deals with national security concerns will now be probed at the heart of government under a shake-up to protect Britain’s key industries. Rishi Sunak has shunted responsibility for vetting crucial investment decisions - like keeping China out of our systems - from the Business Department to the Cabinet Office. It means top Minister Oliver Dowden, a close ally of the PM, will get the final say-so on whether controversial projects can happen on UK soil. A Whitehall source said: “The Business Department were caught napping one too many times, so now key decisions will be made at the very centre of government.” New powers let Ministers block deals involving strategic assets on national security grounds. Last year the Government finally kiboshed the sale of the Newport Wafer Fab semiconductor plant to Chinese-owned Nexperia after months of wrangling. And tech giant Huawei has been banned from the UK’s 5G mobile network for fear Beijing could spy on our systems.

Martin Lewis Show: Warning thousands of Brits could miss out on £200 energy bill help – make sure it’s not you,"MARTIN Lewis has warned that thousands of Brits could be missing out on £200 worth of energy bill help. The money expert is urging people to check if they are eligible for The Alternative Fuel Payment (AFP) scheme. Roughly 2.5million households off the gas grid are able to apply. To be off the gas grid means you don't use mains gas. That means you'll only get the cash if you warm your home using alternative energy sources such as heating oil, biomass and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). But Mr Lewis has warned that many of ""the most vulnerable Brits"" don't even realise they are missing out on the money. He explained: ""It started to be paid out yesterday and I'm told it should finish being paid out this month. ""It's automatically paid through your electricity supplier unless you are fully off-grid and don't have electricity - in which case you'll have to apply later in February. ""Those on pre-payment, you'll get vouchers. They'll email you, they'll post it or they may text you about it so watch out for that. ""So many people haven't redeemed their vouchers on the £400 on prepaid. ""20 per cent of often the most vulnerable people haven't redeemed them. It's absolutely tragic. ""I am suspicious that some people may not get this because they don't have the details of who is on heating or LPG."" It comes as large recent price rises have led to concerns about the impact on households that rely on oil for heating. Recent government data suggests that Northern Irish households rely on heating oil the most - and costs have risen by up to 120% in recent months.

We’re fuming after Gary Glitter moved next door to our home – I’ve told our kids what to do if they see him,"GARY Glitter's new neighbours say they fear for their kids' safety after the pop paedo was released from jail. The pervert, 78, has been housed in a secret bail hostel close to a housing estate after serving just half of his 16-year sentence. Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, was released from HMP The Verne on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, under the cover of darkness on Friday. His strict licence conditions state he is prohibited from going anywhere near schools, playgrounds or swimming pools. But families living nearby say they are concerned and have slammed the decision to move him close to ten schools. Dad Jonathan Wilson said he has reminded his children, aged three, four and seven, not to speak to strangers. He told DorsetLive: ""Our children play in the woods which back onto their property, and we had to tell our kids like, don’t talk to them, don’t go near anyone there. ""Personally, I don’t like those sort of people full stop, the fact they’re slap bang in the middle of where we live. Talk about taking the p*** out of society. ""This is enemy number one, and they’ve released them into the community."" Jonathan said people in the area were ""pretty emotional"" when Glitter arrived. He added: ""People don’t want him around, certainly not in the middle of where people live. ""You’d think these people would be moved in the middle of a field, not where kids are."" Not long after Glitter arrived, cops were called after vigilantes climbed gates and stormed the grounds. Angry locals turned up when the location was shared on social media and screamed abuse at those leaving. It comes after we revealed the pop paedo was being treated like ""royalty"" and having his meals delivered to his room. The pervert is said to be “really happy and upbeat” at the hostel following his release from HMP Verne in Dorset in the early hours of Friday morning.  He was settled in and fitted with a GPS tag, before being reminded of his strict licence conditions. They include abiding by a nightly curfew, a ban on working without prior approval, no travel outside the UK and no contact with the media. He is also barred from living with anyone under the age of 18 and cannot go near schools, playgrounds or swimming pools. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""Sex offenders like Paul Gadd are closely monitored by the police and Probation Service and face some of the strictest licence conditions including being fitted with a GPS tag. ""If the offender breaches these conditions at any point, they can go back behind bars. ""We’ve already introduced tougher sentences for the worst offenders and ended the automatic halfway release for serious crimes."" Glitter was one of the UK’s biggest glam rock stars of the 1970s and a familiar face on BBC TV chart show Top of the Pops. He had a string of hits including three UK No 1 singles: I’m the Leader of the Gang (I Am!), I Love You Love Me Love and Always Yours. Glitter’s fall from grace began in 1997 when he took a laptop into a Bristol branch of PC World for repair and an engineer found child abuse images on the hard drive.  Two years later the singer was jailed for four months after a total of 4,000 images were found by police in a subsequent investigation. He emigrated on release, before being kicked out of Cambodia in 2002 amid claims of committing sex crimes. Four years later he was jailed in neighbouring Vietnam for molesting two girls, one aged just ten. He escaped serious charges of child rape — which carried a death sentence — and returned to the  UK in 2008.  Glitter was forced to sign the sex offender register but he was arrested once again in 2012 at his multimillion-pound home in Westminster. Police would later describe him as a “habitual sexual predator who took advantage of the star status afforded to him."" And in 2015 he was convicted of attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault and one of having sex with a girl under 13 in the 1970s and 1980s.

Depraved David Carrick tried to kill himself in ‘self-pitying’ suicide attempt after arrest,"DEPRAVED cop David Carrick tried to kill himself in a “self-pitying” suicide attempt after he was arrested for raping and abusing women. The former Met Police officer, 48, was moved from HMP Belmarsh to a secure mental health unit on February 22 last year after hurting himself. But a consultant psychiatrist at Rampton Hospital concluded that Carrick did not have depression or any mental disorder. Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said it was “a self-pitying reaction to the shame”. She said the cop had shown no “remorse or regret” beyond admitting guilt at Southwark Crown Court, South London. When assessing the risk he posed to the public, she said: “I am sure that you represent a grave danger to women who might be persuaded to be alone with you in intimate situations and this danger will last indefinitely.”  He has now been handed 36 life sentences with a minimum term of 30 years and 239 days.

David Carrick’s ex says she hopes he finally feels ‘some of the pain’ he caused his victims,"CARRICK’S ex-partner told The Sun that she hopes he finally feels “some of the pain” he caused to so many of his victims. Speaking after he received a life sentence Rachel, whose surname we are not revealing, called him an “evil man” who would have gone on to do much worse if the brave victims had not come forward. She met Carrick, 48, on a dating app in 2010 and would see him about twice a month on and off for five years. Rachel said: “I have waited for this day for the last few years and even more so since he was caught.  ""I felt that some justice has been done and most of all I feel relieved knowing no other woman will have to go through what myself and so many others did, hopefully ever again by this man. “Part of me does feel he should of gone to trial, more so the victims had a chance to really go through their account of events to show him what he did to them however that has been touched on ever so slightly as their statements were able to be read out – I hope every word sunk into him and he feels some of the pain he may of caused them. “I personally have come to realise and have to deal with the impact his behaviour towards me has had on my relationships following my interaction with him and ultimately he has caused me a lot of issues with trusting men. “He has not only had an emotional effect on me but also on any relationship I’ve had since knowing David. “As much as my interactions with this vile man were consensual, they were certainly not right, I look back now and think “how dare he” and “what is wrong with him”. “He’s a power hungry and evil man and it doesn’t bear thinking about the lengths he might have gone to had those brave women not come forward. “I hope 30 years inside prison will make him accountable for his terrible actions.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21311118/david-carricks-ex-pain-victims/
Royal Mail reveals image of King Charles that will be on first and second class stamps from April,"THIS is the image of the King that will be on first and second class stamps from April.

Mr Gold said: ""The guidance we got from His Majesty was more about continuity and not doing anything too different to what had gone before.

""Personally, I think what marks this stamp out is that there is no embellishment at all, no crown, just simply the face of the human being, on the plain background, almost saying, 'this is me and I'm at your service', which I think in this modern age is actually rather humbling.""

Vladimir Putin loses yet another high-ranking general in Ukraine war,"VLADIMIR Putin has lost yet another general in the war in Ukraine, according to reports. Major-General Dmitry Ulyanov, 44, had only recently returned to active service after retirement as a commander in Russia’s illegal invasion. He was said to have died after coming under attack from a Ukrainian sabotage group this week. Previously, Ulyanov was a top paratrooper and ­commander of the elite 98th Guards Airborne Division. He went to the war as commander of a regiment of mobilised motorised infantrymen. Ulyanov had earlier served as the Chief of Staff of the 7th Airborne Division. He’s the first such high ranked commander to be killed for many months. His death means Putin has now lost at least ten senior commanders.

Rishi Sunak promotes trusted MP Greg Hands to be Tory chairman in Cabinet reshuffle,"RISHI Sunak promoted trusted MP Greg Hands to be Tory chairman in a Cabinet reshuffle yesterday. The PM also carved up the business brief into three parts, creating a Net Zero department. His decision alarmed sceptical Tories worried that plans to decarbonise the economy by 2050 would hit the poorest hardest. Tory MP Craig Mackinlay said the aim was too costly, impractical and challenging “for the way we all live”. Ex-Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Secretary Grant Shapps takes on the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero role. He said: “My focus will be securing our long-term energy supply, bringing down bills and thereby helping to halve inflation.” The rest of his old brief went to Kemi Badenoch, who is promoted to Business and Trade Secretary, and Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan who heads the new Department of Science, Innovation and Technology Cabinet newbie Lucy Frazer was handed the remaining parts of the Culture, Media and Sport brief. Meanwhile, Mr Hands, who takes over from sacked Nadhim Zahawi, will be helped by Lee Anderson, a favourite with many Red Wall Tories.

Suella Braverman set to order  ‘back to basics’ reboot of controversial anti-terror scheme Prevent,"THE flagship anti-terror Prevent programme is too focused on a tiny number right-wing nutjobs rather than tackling jihadis, a damning review will say today. Suella Braverman is set to order a ""back to basics"" reboot of the controversial scheme, after it is found to be referring far too many lower-risk far-right loners rather than focusing on dangerous Islamists. She will today publish the findings of a major report into the troubled programme, conducted by William Shawcross. It is expected to call for an urgent overhaul after finding it was treating too many potential terrorists as victims with mental health problems instead. Seven out of the 13 terror attacks in the past six years - including the murder of MP David Amess, the Reading attacks, and the bombing of Liverpool Women's Hospital, have been carried out by sickos who had been known to Prevent. But the review - commissioned more than three years ago by former Home Secretary, Priti Patel - will say it has been overwhelmed with cases and is facing too many referrals for ""far right"" ideologies which has led to a string of missed opportunities. It is also set to say that authorities did not refer people over fears of being racist or culturally insensitive. And it is also set to reveal that taxpayer cash from the £40million budget has been handed by Prevent to groups who promote Islamic extremism. Potential extremists can be referred to the programme by police or local authorities. Last year there were more than 6,400 cases for chiefs to sort through in a bid to find people who could put the public at risk. The Home Secretary is understood to be prepared to accept the majority of the recommendations and push to hugely reform the programme to focus back on foiling major plots. One source said: ""They are seeing too many people being referred to on far right issues, rather than people being radicalised and moving towards terrorism. We need to go back to basics on this.""

Cops charged to Ashford, in Surrey, at around 2.30pm yesterday when a vile mob attacked a single girl. Five were cuffed following the ""shocking"" assault near Thomas Knyvett College at the junction of Salcombe Road and Stanwell Road. A 39-year-old woman, a 16-year-old girl and a 43-year-old man were also arrested for their roles in the savage assault. Police are now hunting a 15-year-old girl who has gone on the run - she is aware they are after her. A spokesperson for Surrey Police said: ""We are aware that this incident will have caused concern among students, parents, and staff at Thomas Knyvett College, as well as the wider community. ""We would like to reassure you that an investigation is underway, five arrests have been made in connection with this incident.

Who is PC David Carrick?,"DISGRACED former PC David Carrick was handed 36 life sentences on February 7, 2023 for his sick crimes against women. Here's what we know about him, and the vile crimes he was sentenced for. The cop admitted to the horrific crimes on January 16, 2023 - with the Metropolitan Police since apologising over the missed chances to catch him. PC David Carrick, 46, of Stevenage, Hertfordshire, is a former police officer based within the Met's Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command. He first served in the Military before becoming a Met Police officer from August 2001. It is an armed unit based in Westminster that is responsible for the protection of sensitive sites such as parliament and Downing Street. Following his arrest in 2021, Mr Carrick was suspended by the Metropolitan Police, with the force adding a referral has been made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. Nearly a thousand police officers and staff have been investigated for posting objectionable social media content, but only a small percentage have left their jobs. The majority of statistics, include several senior staff, escaped with only disciplinary action.  Nearly three quarters of the allegations were deemed serious enough to require some form of disciplinary action. However, freedom of Information figures show only 53 staff left the force as a result. Since 2015, at least 999 police officers and staff have been reported by either members of the public or colleagues for misusing social media. On January 16, 2022, Carrick admitted to 49 sex offences, including 24 counts of rape. These offences took place against 12 women, with some being abused multiple times. His crimes took place in a 17 year period between 2003 and 2020. Carrick's twisted offending finally came to an end when a brave victim came forward after another police rapist was jailed. It also emerged the monster came to police attention nine times before his arrest following rape and domestic violence allegations. The Met have apologised for not taking an earlier opportunity to capture the fiend, who worked for the force's Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command unit. The prolific rapist was handed 36 life sentences with a minimum term of 30 years and 239 days on February 7, 2023. Met police commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said: “David Carrick’s crimes were unspeakably evil. The detail is harrowing. “He subjected these victims and survivors to the most degrading and inhumane treatment and yet they still showed the courage to come forward and to provide the evidence that led to his conviction. “He exploited his position as a police officer in the most disgusting way. He should not have been a police officer."" ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16321271/who-is-pc-david-carrick/

We live in one of England’s most ‘stressful’ cities – people say we’re mad to live here but we love it… here’s why,"RESIDENTS of one of the UK's 'most stressful' cities have insisted that they love where they live. Locals of Hull, Yorkshire, said that they don't see why it was ranked in the top three of a recent stress survey and that they ""like the atmosphere"" of the city. A study by Abbeycare Group, a residential rehab provider, ranked Hull behind only Blackpool, Lancashire, and Chesterfield, Derbyshire. The results were based on metrics including the percentage of smokers by area, anxiety levels, average hours worked per week and the number of people who have never worked from home. However, residents disagreed with the findings when asked by Hull Daily Mail. Khrizza, who works as a nurse in the local A&E department, said: ""I don’t find it stressful living here. People here are friendly. ""To de-stress I go for a walk around town. I like the atmosphere in Hull. It’s quiet."" Fellow local Carlo Colombari, who has lived with his partner Jean in the city centre for ten years, said: ""We love it here. ""We travel a lot. There’s a lot worse places than Hull. I read a lot, reading calms me down."" Jean added: ""There’s a lot going on in Hull if people go out and look and open their eyes...People here are so friendly."" Before moving to the city, the couple used to live in Hornsea, Yorkshire, which they called ""boring"". Meanwhile, John Taylor, who lives just outside Hull, said: ""Everyone’s under stress. It’s unnecessary stress. Every town has its issues. ""I try to get myself to happy places and meet nice people just to give me that lift. About 90 per cent of people here are pleasant."" Hull's high position on the table of stressful cities was based on Abbeycare's findings that 75 per cent of residents have never worked from home, as well as high levels of anxiety and low life satisfaction reported in their surveys.

"Epsom College head Emma Pattison made distressed call to sister minutes before she was ‘shot dead with her daughter, 7’","A PRESTIGIOUS private school headteacher made a distressed phone call to her sister minutes before she was shot dead by her husband, it is understood. Emma Pattison's seven-year-old daughter Lettie was also killed in the tragedy before dad George allegedly turned the gun on himself.  The mum's cry for help to Deborah Kirk prompted relatives to drive to the Pattison home on the grounds of Epsom College, Surrey, in the early hours of Sunday, MailOnline reports.  By the time they got there, all three were dead.  Surrey Police believe George, 39, who held a shotgun licence, killed his wife, 45, and young daughter before taking his own life in a double murder-suicide.  A firearm registered to the chartered accountant was found at the scene but officers have not yet disclosed the cause of the deaths.  The force confirmed that George was in contact with them just days before the killings to update the address on his gun licence as is ""routine"".  Despite Emma being appointed headmistress in September, the family reportedly only handed over the keys to their old house a few weeks ago.  George may have stayed behind in the four-bedroom property in Caterham while Emma and Lettie settled into their new home, believed to be surrounded by properties occupied by other school staff members.  One former neighbour told MailOnline: ""I wasn't sure if anybody had actually moved out because I'd seen George quite recently, in the run up to Christmas. ""He was by himself, Emma and Lettie were not with him. His BMW 8 Series was parked on the drive."" Due to how close in time the changes to George's gun licence were made and the triple killing, the incident has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). Detective Chief Inspector Kimball Edey, Senior Investigating Officer on the case, said today: ""This is an incredibly traumatic incident and we are working around the clock to investigate and understand the exact circumstances which led to this point. ""We understand the public concern and upset, and we will clarify what we can, when we can, while respecting the right to a level of privacy for the families of those who have lost their lives. ""We are cooperating fully with the IOPC in relation to the referral we have made, and we await the outcome of its assessment of what further action may be required."" Sources say George had no criminal history and was not on Surrey Police's radar. The only time they crossed paths previously was when he accused his wife of striking him in 2016. He is said to have reported her for the domestic incident but later withdrew the claims as he decided it was a trivial matter, The Times reports. Following the possible murder-suicide and the ""incredibly distressing"" details that have emerged, Epsom College announced it was closing until after the half-term break.  In a letter to parents, seen by the BBC, acting head Paul Williams said: ""Now is a time for families to come together and try and process this shocking news. ""The impact on your children cannot be underestimated and we are doing everything we possibly can to support them in whatever way they need."" Emma became the elite school's first female head in September 2022 after six years at the helm of Croydon High School in south London. Boarding students at the college pay more than £42,000 a year and its alumni include Conservative MP Sir Michael Fallon, broadcaster Jeremy Vine and comedian Tim Vine. Her husband George was a chartered accountant who was director of a management consultancy called Tanglewood 2016, according to Companies House. Parents and former colleagues described Emma as a ""wonderful teacher"" who ""enriched"" her students' lives. Late last year she said the transition from her old job had been full of ""really big changes"" for her family but she was ""absolutely loving"" her time at Epsom College so far. Emma told a student-run podcast: ""It has been very, very busy, but absolutely wonderful.""

"Major firm axes 1,300 jobs after struggling following end of the pandemic","A MAJOR firm has axed 1,300 jobs after struggling following the end of the pandemic. Zoom, the video and communications provider, has slashed its workforce by 15%. The firm justified the move due to slowing user growth and falling profits. Zoom's business exploded during the pandemic when millions had to switch to working from home. The firm's sales in the last three months of 2020, at the height of the pandemic, soared by 370%. And sales grew by a further 40% in 2021. But as the pandemic eased and people returned to offices, demand for online conferencing software has shrunk. Reflecting this reduction in demand, Zoom chief executive Eric Yuan will also reduce his own salary in the coming financial year by 98%. Mr Yuan said in a memo to employees: ""As the world transitions to life post-pandemic, we are seeing that people and businesses continue to rely on Zoom. ""But the uncertainty of the global economy, and its effect on our customers, means we need to take a hard - yet important - look inward to reset ourselves so we can weather the economic environment, deliver for our customers and achieve Zoom's long-term vision."" But Zoom isn't the only tech giant struggling in the competitive arena. Microsoft announced that it would axe 10,000 jobs due to the global economic crisis last month. Microsoft which employs 220,000 people worldwide, 6,000 of which are in the UK, will cut 5% of its workforce by September. The job cuts would affect staff worldwide, according to a statement released by Microsoft. But it remains unclear if UK-based positions will be affected. Amazon announced earlier in January that it planned to shut three UK warehouses putting 1,200 jobs at risk. The group, which employs around 1.5million people globally, warned in November that its workers could be laid off. The online retail giant also announced plans to cut more than 18,000 jobs worldwide at the beginning of January.

"Martin Lewis Money Show: Urgent warning about easy check that can save you £1,000s before bills soar this spring","MARTIN Lewis has urged households to do a simple check that could knock £1,000s off their water bills. The money expert told audience members about the trick on The Martin Lewis Money Show live this week. Households will see the largest hike in their annual water bills in almost 20 years when they rise to an average of £448 this spring. From April 1, water bills will rise by roughly 7% for households in England and Wales and by 5% for those in Scotland. Water UK said the increase would see customers pay around £1.23 per day on average, from April in England and Wales. This is an increase of 8p per day, or an average of £31 more than last year’s charges. However, one thing the MoneySavingExpert.com (MSE) founder said people could do is to check if they're entitled to a water meter as it could knock money off their bill. One money saver said they're saving £1,000 on their water bill by switching to a water meter.  She said: ""Following your advice, we switched to a water meter now our children have left home, and our bills have gone from £1,360 per year to £325 - saving over £1,000 per year."" All households need to first, Martin said, is check if they've got more or the same number of bedrooms than people living in their home. Martin said: ""Water bill are based on the rateable value which is a proxy for the house value."" This means you could be a big bill even if you don't use that much (as there's less of you). If you think you qualify, Martin said you can head to The Consumer Council for Water website and use its free water meter calculator.  It will ask you questions about water use and estimated costs.  Households can then request a fitting from their water company. ""If they [your water company] say they can't fit a water meter because it's not practicable, then ask for an assessed charge which could tell you roughly what you pay on a water meter if you had one. The money expert added: ""And if that's cheaper then you can just pay the lower amount. ""If you're disabled, if you've got related medical issues or you're on benefits, speak to your water firm - you may be able to get money back or a cheaper tariff."" However, if you do use a lot of water then it makes no sense to have a meter as your bills could go up. For example, if you have a big family and more people than bedrooms or simply use lots of water-intensive appliances like washing machines or dishwashers, a fixed fee will be better for you. Having a water meter doesn't help with the standard charge that's based on where you live either, but it can help you cut down the costs of your personal usage at home. Part of that is how long you spend in the shower too. According to Uswitch, you could cut £70 from your energy bills and reduce your water bills too by reducing your wash time. And leaving the water running while you brush your teeth could add £60 a year to your bills says Octopus. The same goes for washing dishes, be sure you turn the tap off as if you’re doing it in the sink, leaving it running will add £25 to your annual bill. If you're struggling and can't save with a water meter, there is help available.  Water companies are increasing their support for low-income households by up to £200million, according to Water UK.

Who was Desmond Noonan?,"DESMOND NOONAN was a well-known criminal, and part of the Manchester underworld in the 80s and 90s. He was murdered in 2005, but what else do we know about him? Raised in a family of 14 children in tough poverty, each child had a first name beginning with the letter D - a reference to Dublin, and the Irish roots of their parents. Desmond 'Dessy' Noonan was an Irish Republican, anti-fascist and the key to helping the brothers monopolise the supply of bouncers at the club and others in the city. The Noonan family found notoriety and made a fortune, firstly specialising in armed robbery. Brothers Damien, Desmond and Dominic then found a much more lucrative way to to generate big money. Together, they took over the doors of the city's nightclubs - thus controlling who had access to sell drugs in them. Manchester's legendary dance venue, The Hacienda, would become their golden goose. Running the doors and taking a cut from drugs profits there meant they were making up to £50,000 a night, according to a new documentary.
 Then having been consumed by an out-of-control alcohol and crack cocaine habit, Dessy was stabbed to death by a crack dealer in Chorlton in March 2005. His funeral was held in south Manchester on 22 April 2005. Derek McDuffus, a drug dealer from south Manchester, was charged on 15 June, 2005 after appearing at Preston Crown Court, and was eventually convicted of Noonan's murder, for which he received a life sentence. By the mid-1990s Desmond Noonan was known as an enforcer, a very dangerous and violent man who had links with a wide swathe of Britain's underworld. Former GMP officer, Martin Harding, said of the brothers: ""The Noonans were synonymous with violence. ""They displayed very little fear. They had no fear of the authorities, no fear of prison. They were not scared to use violence."" With Dessy as the enforcer and hit man, Dominic the charismatic, but predatory entrepreneur, and Damien at the helm they took over clubland's doors - and did not tolerate any gangs trying to muscle in on their lucrative domain. Dominic Noonan, now known as Domenyk Lattlay-Fottfoy after changing his name by deed poll, is Dessy's younger brother. In May 2018 he was convicted of 13 historic sex offences against under-aged males and was given a further 11-year sentence that was to begin after the sentence he was given in 2016 for  arson, blackmail and perverting the course of justice.

"Butcher charged over disappearance of girl, 11, found in house after major police search","A BUTCHER has been charged over the disappearance of an 11-year-old girl. Andrew Miller, 53 — also known as Amy — was arrested after the child was found at a house in Galashiels, Selkirkshire, following a 27-hour search. Cops were seen combing the family butchers’ shop Millers of Melrose, which is linked to the suspect. Police cars guarded the business run by Miller, who was quizzed over the youngster’s disappearance. He has now been charged and is due to appear at Selkirk Sheriff Court tomorrow. Chief Superintendent Catriona Paton, Lothians and Scottish Borders commander, said: ""I want to thank the public for their huge effort and assistance during this incident.  ""The people of Galashiels really came together and supported each other, the emergency services and search teams. “We believe this incident to be contained and enquiries into the circumstances are ongoing. ""There will be increased high visibility patrols in the streets to provide reassurance and advice to the public, and anyone with concerns can speak to an officer at any time."" The youngster was reported missing from the Gala Park area of Galashiels. Officers said they were “extremely concerned” for her welfare. On Monday, locals, police and search and rescue teams scoured the town’s streets, green spaces and waterways for the girl. Villagers revealed the 27-hour search ended with the girl being carried out of a house in a blanket two miles from her home. Forensic officers have been seen combing the property in Gattonside for evidence. Last night, one of the schoolgirl’s relieved relatives said: “She’s home, that’s the main thing. It’s up to the police to do their job.” The Millers of Melrose business was featured in the novel Career of Evil by JK Rowling, under her pen-name Robert Galbraith. A signed picture of the Harry Potter author and a framed extract from the 2015 crime fiction book remains in the window.

Major high street department store closing shops – is one near you going for good?,"A MAJOR high street department store is closing shops as sales continue to take a hit. House of Fraser is set to shut up shop in two more locations as it battles to keep a presence in the retail sector. In November, House of Fraser closed it's Westfield branch in Shepherd's Bush, while its department store in High Wycombe shut for good in January.  It has also been previously reported that the department store will close its Cardiff branch in the iconic Howells building after it recently launched a major clearance sale. But the exact date remains unclear and Frasers Group wouldn’t confirm it. It follows a string of House of Fraser closures in recent months, after the retailer admitted that they are unprofitable due to business rates.   House of Fraser has also temporarily closed its Norwich store which it plans to reopen in the autumn following its refurbishment.  And now it's understood the Birmingham department store could also be at risk.  It has turned the city-centre store into an outlet, whilst slashing the prices of all stock with messaging that reads ""all stock must go.""  These big ""closing down"" style events usually precede a store closure, but The Sun understands that no final decision has been made on its future as of yet. There are plans to open more stores, which will include a mix of brands including Flannels and Sports Direct.  House of Fraser was saved from collapse by billionaire businessman Mike Ashley back in 2018. But while the deal saved the chain's 59 stores some 17,000 workers who were facing the axe. Many more stores have closed in recent years and only 30 department stores remain. It comes as other retailers have struggled to compete with online shops and other big brands. Just this week, clothing store M&Co announced it would be shutting all 170 of its stores this year. The company fell into administration in December and was bought by Yours Clothing. But only the M&Co branding was purchased - meaning the shops have not been saved. Another popular high street store H&M also revealed it would be closing several branches. H&M confirmed to The Sun that two branches in Hartlepool and Isle of Wight are set to close. It hasn't given a date for when they will shut the doors for good or if workers are at risk of redundancy. It comes just days after the high street shop shuttered its branch in Burton and another in Maidenhead. New Look has also brought the shutters down on three of its stores in recent weeks. Its owner Sainsbury's also revealed that Lloyd's Pharmacy is withdrawing its services from over 200 Sainsbury's stores. Meanwhile, stationery chain Paperchase has said it's in talks with potential buyers after lining up administrators. Major burger chain Byron Burger also recently fell into administration and is set to close nine restaurants immediately. The owners of the chain have said the closures will result in the loss of 218 jobs.  ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/21307719/high-street-department-store-closing-shops-house-of-fraser/

Emma Pattison cops investigated by watchdog after head’s husband contacted officers over gun days before rampage,"DETECTIVES investigating the possible murder-suicide of a headteacher, her seven-year-old daughter and husband are being probed by the police watchdog.  Surrey Police referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after it was revealed its officers had spoken to the alleged killer about his gun licence just days before the rampage.  George Pattison is believed to have shot his wife Emma and daughter Lettie before turning the gun on himself in the early hours of February 5.  A firearm registered to him was discovered at the scene on the grounds of Epsom College, Surrey, where the family lived.  The dad had been in contact with his local force to change the address on his licence on February 2.  He had recently moved to Epsom following his wife's appointment as headmistress at the prestigious school.  Cops said the procedure was ""routine"" but passed the case to the IOPC due to the ""short period of time"" between the correspondence and discovery of the bodies.  The Independent understands the review was carried out over the phone and officers did not visit the family home.  He is thought to have assured officers his weapon was safely stored, according to The Times.  Detective Chief Inspector Kimball Edey, senior investigating officer on the case, said: ""This is an incredibly traumatic incident and we are working around the clock to investigate and understand the exact circumstances which led to this point. ""We understand the public concern and upset, and we will clarify what we can, when we can, while respecting the right to a level of privacy for the families of those who have lost their lives. ""We are cooperating fully with the IOPC in relation to the referral we have made, and we await the outcome of its assessment of what further action may be required."" Police had separately investigated an allegation that Emma had hit her husband during a domestic incident in 2016. He later withdrew the claim, saying it was trivial, The Times reports. The triple killing is being treated as a double murder and suicide but the case of deaths has not yet been disclosed.  Emma made a distressed phone call to her sister Deborah Kirk minutes before she was killed, it is understood.  Her cry for help reportedly prompted relatives to drive to the Pattison family home in the early hours of February 5, according to MailOnline. By the time they got there, Emma, Lettie and George were dead. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21314178/police-watchdog-emma-pattison-husband-gun/
Monster rapist cop David Carrick ‘will be on death watch 24/7 after lags put a bounty on his head’,"MONSTER Met Police rapist David Carrick will be on 24-hour ""death watch"" in jail, according to reports. The predator was yesterday handed 36 life sentences after he was unmasked as one of the UK's most prolific sex offenders. Prison sources now claim Carrick, 48, already has a bounty on his head, Daily Star reports. As a result, the former gun cop will be watched 24/7 in an isolated cell while serves the minimum 30 year term on his sentence. Carrick tortured his victims as he abused his position in the police to ""charm and beguile"" them in a 17 year reign of terror. The monster locked women naked in a cupboard under the stairs for ten hours at a time, controlled what they ate and branded them his ""slaves"". He was revealed as one of the UK's worst serial rapists last month after admitting 49 charges - including 24 counts of rape. Some of the multiple-incident counts relate to at least 85 separate offences -including at least 71 sexual offences and 48 rapes. Shockingly, it also emerged Carrick came to police attention nine times before his arrest after rape and domestic violence allegations were made against him. At his two-day sentencing hearing, the court was told Carrick attempted to kill himself while on remand at Belmarsh. Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said this was a ""self-pitying reaction to the shame brought on you by these proceedings rather than remorse"". She also said the women involved were not ""weak or ineffectual"" but instead ""victims of your criminal mindset"". The judge added: ""These convictions represent a spectacular downfall for a man charged with upholding the law and empowered to do so even to the extent of being authorised to bear a firearm in the execution of his duty. ""Behind a public appearance of propriety and trustworthiness, you took monstrous advantage of women drawn into intimate relationships with you. “You brazenly raped and sexually assaulted a number of women, some very brutally, and you behaved as if you were untouchable. ""You were bold and at times relentless, trusting that no victim would overcome her shame and fear to report you. ""For nearly two decades, you were proved right but now a combination of those 12 women, by coming forward, and your police colleagues, by acting on their evidence, have exposed you and brought you low. ""You have lost your liberty, your job and your status. You have before you the prospect of a difficult time in custody for many years."" The judge branded the serial predator a ""grave danger"" to women but said the crimes did not meet the threshold for a whole life tariff that would see him die in jail. Carrick's sentence will now be reviewed under the Unduly Lenient Scheme. The Attorney General was bombarded with complaints following the fiend's sentencing yesterday. Under the current minimum term, he will be 78 before he is eligible for parole. A spokesman for the Attorney General's Office said: “We can confirm we have received multiple requests relating to David Carrick’s sentence under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme.  ""The case will of course be considered for referral to The Court of Appeal. “The Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme allows prosecutors, victims of crime and their families and members of the public to ask for certain Crown Court sentences to be reviewed by the law officers if they think the sentencing judge made a gross error or imposed a sentence outside the range of sentences reasonably available in circumstances of the offence.”    ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21312402/rapist-cop-david-carrick-death-watch-prison/
Three women and man rushed to hospital ‘with dog attack injuries’ after bulldogs target husky on walk,"THREE women and a man have been rushed to hospital after an alleged dog attack on a busy beach. Marie Hay and her two daughters were walking their husky on the seafront in Redcar, Yorkshire, on February 5, when they claim they were set upon by a pair of bulldogs. Cleveland Police confirmed the hospitalisations and are appealing for information regarding the reports of a dog attack. A spokesperson for the force said: ""Police were called to the beach near the caravan park at Redcar just after 3pm on Sunday, 5th February to a report of a dog attack by two bulldog type pets on a husky. ""Officers attended the scene and took initial details including a counter allegation from the bulldogs’ owner.  ""It’s understood at least one dog received veterinary treatment and a man and three women attended hospital for treatment - primarily for hand injuries."" Marie said her dog, Naevia, required life-saving treatment, which could result in a vet's bill of up to £14,000. She told Teesside Live:[The] dog came over and sniffed my dog and then done a little scuffle and made a noise and then just jumped on her and bit her face and wouldn't let go. ""They didn't have harnesses or leads, nothing at all. So there was no way of grabbing them to get them off."" She added that another dog then ran over and jumped on Naevia as members of the public tried to break up the fight. Both Marie and her 20-year-old daughter Jessica were treated for bite wounds, with Jessica requiring antibiotics and a tetanus jab. The mum said that she's struggling to sleep in the wake of the alleged attack and feels ""shocked and traumatised"" by the ordeal.

"Key question Nicola Bulley cops need to answer in order to crack missing mum case, according to expert","POLICE must confirm whether Nicola Bulley's dog can swim to unlock the riddle of her disappearance, Britain's top dog expert says. If springer spaniel Willow can, it would mean in ""nine out of ten instances"" the animal would have jumped in if Nicola fell into the River Wyre. But as the dog was found dry by a passer-by, it leaves the question open whether the 45-year-old went in the water at all, former cop Colin Tennant says. Colin - a dog behaviourist of 40 years - told The Sun Online: ""The question for the owners is: 'is your dog water trained or not?' ""If this dog had been taught to swim, it would have dived in the water. ""Not to rescue her, it would have jumped in with no hesitation and therefore it would have been wet."" But Colin, who worked with Cheshire Police for five years, stressed that if it turns out Willow cannot swim - ""we are back to square one"". This is because it would not offer any clues as to whether the mum-of-two fell into the Lancashire river or not. Discussing the reaction of a dog that cannot swim, he explained: ""If the woman had gone in the water, the dog would have run up and down the bank. ""And if the woman cried out, it would follow the sound but not see her, it would be perplexed. ""After that, the dog would just panic and run up and down -  inhaling all the scent of its owner in that field. ""Then it would run back further and further until the woman said she found it."" Willow was discovered by a walker near a bench where her lead and Nicola's phone were found around an hour after Nicola was last seen near St Michael's on Wyre at around 9.15am on January 27. Cops are now focusing search efforts on the track from the fields, where she was last seen, to Garstang Road in St Michaels on Wyre, which may hold vital clues. It is a CCTV blackspot around the field and they are appealing to drivers and cyclists who may have dashcam footage. Police are confident, after reviewing CCTV, that Nicola, from nearby Inskip, did not leave the field near the river via Rowanwater. This is the case for leaving either through the site itself or the piece of land at the side. And she did not return from the fields along Allotment Lane or via the path at the rear of the Grapes pub onto Garstang Road. Colin said that while his analysis is purely speculation, the blackspot path revelation offered a potentially interesting lead. He explained that if it transpires the dog was unable to get out of the field to follow Nicola - if indeed she left the area via this route - it would have run back and forth along scent lines. This, he speculated, may suggest why a walker discovered Willow ""agitated"". The canine expert says the spaniel was more likely ""perplexed"" if it was unable to find Nicola. This is the exact same reaction the dog would have if unable to swim and therefore go after Nicola into the river, instead charging up and down the river bank. Colin explained: ""Who defines what agitated is? It may be a little bit bewildered. ""Dog's cannot process what they saw like we can, they stand 10inches above the ground. ""Whatever the dog saw last, the dog will migrate back to that spot."" He added the scent of the mum would be found all over the field, stretching back all the way to their home, leaving the dog to run up and down the scent lines. Lancashire Constabulary are still working on the hypothesis Nicola ""sadly fell"" into the river. Nicola and partner Paul Ansell would take it in turns to take Willow for a walk after dropping their kids, nine and six, off at the local primary school. They would walk the same towpath along the banks of the River Wyre each day. The Sun Online have approached Lancashire Constabulary for comment on whether Willow the dog can swim.

Three chilling signs before Emma Pattison’s husband shot her and their daughter in ‘double murder-suicide’,"DETECTIVES are ""working around the clock"" to piece together what happened before a man allegedly killed his wife, seven-year-old daughter and then himself.  They believe George Pattison, 39, shot dead headteacher Emma, 45, and little Lettie late on Saturday night before taking his own life in a murder-suicide.  Several shocking details have emerged in the days since the tragedy on the grounds of Epsom College, Surrey.  But as the investigation enters its fourth day, here are three of the most chilling things we know so far.  Emma was appointed head of the prestigious private school in September 2022 and moved into a property on-site.  But the family reportedly only handed over the keys to their old house in Caterham a few weeks ago.  George, who held a shotgun licence, is understood to have stayed behind at the four-bedroom home while Emma and Lettie settled into their new one.  His BMW Series 8 remained parked on the drive and several neighbours say they spotted him working from home, drinking wine in the kitchen and regularly coming and going.  One former neighbour told MailOnline: ""I could see the lights on in the evening and his car was around but never hers."" Another said: ""I wasn't sure if anybody had actually moved out because I'd seen George quite recently, in the run up to Christmas. ""I hadn't seen [Emma] nor her daughter since last summer. I think she moved out before George."" The chartered accountant is understood to have left last month after the sale of the £1.5million house went through. A removal van carrying the last of their belongings was allegedly seen in the road in January.  Emma made a distressed phone call to her sister Deborah Kirk minutes before she was shot dead, it is understood.  Her cry for help reportedly prompted relatives to drive to the Pattison family home in the early hours of February 5, according to MailOnline.  By the time they got there, Emma, Lettie and George were dead. A firearm registered to the dad was also discovered at the scene, though cops have not yet confirmed the cause of the deaths.  Sources say George had no criminal history and was not on Surrey Police's radar. The only time he crossed paths with the force previously was when he accused his wife of striking him in 2016. He is said to have reported her for hitting him during a domestic incident. But he later withdrew the claims, saying the matter was trivial, The Times reports. George was also in contact with officers just days before the killings, but cops said this was for a ""routine"" change of address on his gun licence.  It is assumed this was because he had officially moved into the family home at Epsom College.  Due to the short period of time between the licence update and the possible murder-suicide, the incident has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). Detective Chief Inspector Kimball Edey, Senior Investigating Officer on the case, said today: ""This is an incredibly traumatic incident and we are working around the clock to investigate and understand the exact circumstances which led to this point. ""We understand the public concern and upset, and we will clarify what we can, when we can, while respecting the right to a level of privacy for the families of those who have lost their lives.

Each of the estimated 4000 Hancock Prospecting workers has a one per cent chance of winning a jackpot bonus. The 41 cash prizes represent each of the 41 years she has worked at Hancock Prospecting, her incredibly successful mining business. Employees said they have been assured the prizes will be tax free. Worth £5billion and dubbed Australia's richest woman, Gina gave out £600,000 in Christmas bonuses less than two months ago in a similar raffle. One winner of the Christmas giveaway reportedly only worked at the company for three months. Some of the names drawn at the last raffle weren't there in person, so Gina allegedly kept drawing names until someone in the room won a prize. One unnamed worker told The Financial Review: “It was pretty insane being in the room, and she kept saying the prize money came ‘after nasty tax’."" Gina's mining company reportedly said future prize giveaways will be suspended if the iron ore price falls below a ""very low threshold"". Until then, the incredibly lucrative “Rinehart raffles” will happen at least twice a year, sources say. Many social media users praised the generous birthday bonuses. One user said: ""I have been saying for years she is a good person. In your face to the people who were freaking nasty about her.  ""Thanks, Gina for giving people the opportunity to move forward in life with a bit of help in your birthday raffle."" But not everyone was pleased - some thought the bonuses weren't enough considering Gina's enourmous net worth. One Twitter account said: ""I don't think this is fair, distribute it equally amongst all the employees!"" Another piped in: ""She'll probably get it all back one way or another."" The billionaire's iron ore mining company, Roy Hill Mine, made a massive £2billion profit last year. Rinehart is the only daughter of iron-ore magnate Lang Hancock, and took over his company after he died in 1992. One Aussie boss sent her employees on a two week trip to Bali for free. Boss Katya Vakulenko said: ""I think it's important for workplaces to all work together as a team, both inside and outside of working hours."" UK start-up boss Ashley Jones surprised his entire team with a £7,000 trip to Ibiza and Calvin Harris tickets. And the Ibiza trip is not the only insane bonus Ashley gave his employees - they've been treated well for months. In the past two months, they've all attended Parklife festival and went to see Billie Eilish and Harry Styles together. Another boss spent more than £400,000 on luxury holidays for his team to reward their hard work. Mark Neilson, 35, said he hopes the vacations he awards will motivate his workers to earn more money for his life insurance agency.

"My blood froze as I saw my wife & newborn hit by Turkey quake on baby cam 535 miles away, says Brit as deaths hit 9,500","A BRIT dad said he watched helplessly hundreds of miles away as his baby monitor captured the moment the Turkey earthquake struck. He said his ""blood froze"" as he watched the footage of the moment the huge first quake hit early on Monday as the death toll from the disaster reaches 9500. Two further earthquakes struck in the 24 hours after the initial tremor, leaving a trail of destruction stretching for hundreds of miles along Turkey’s border with Syria. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has declared a three-month state of emergency in quake epicentre, Gaziantep, and nine other cities. Desperate searches are taking place to find survivors buried underneath the rubble of the thousands of buildings destroyed. The baby monitor footage has been shared by Lemi, from Hull, who was in Istanbul as his wife and child were in the city of Adana, near the quake’s epicentre, staying with family. Video shows little Katelyn in her cot when the room begins to shake and her desperate mum picks her up as she can be heard saying “oh my God”. Lemi, from Hull, there was a “big bang” and the dog began barking before she ran downstairs with Katelyn. “You can hear the whole building squeaking and that tapping noise,"" he told the Hull Daily Mail. ""When you watch it your blood freezes.” After his wife sent Lemi video from the baby camera, he then began the 535 mile drive to Adana, where he came across scenes of devastation with over a dozen apartment blocks flattened. “Evacuation is not even a subject because once the building collapses they’re already in it and some of them are still under it,” said Lemi, who provides security for Hull City owner Acul Ilicali. It comes as... “Some of them have been rescued. It’s only been a day so the rescue is still ongoing. There are still many more apartments that have not been looked under.” A friend has now set up the Go Fund Me page on behalf of Lemi and Victoria. At least 20,426 are so far reported injured with at least 11,302 buildings destroyed and it's feared the death toll could reach 20,000. Heartbreaking stories are beginning to emerge from the aftermath of the quake. Harrowing images show Mesut Hancer sat holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter Irmak. She had died in the city of Kahramanmaras, her fingers reaching in vain from the wreckage of their home. A new baby was born under the rubble was carried to safety with her umbilical cord still attached in Jenderes, in Syria. Tragically her mother was reported to have died shortly after giving birth while trapped for more than 24 hours. In the harbour city of Iskenderen, the sky turned black as hundreds of shipping containers caught fire.

Wilko makes major change at 400 stores – and it’s good news for shoppers,"WILKO has introduced a major change to its 400 stores across the UK. The retailer is introducing a click & collect service for shoppers. Customers can already order for collection at half of Wilko's stores following a trial period. And the remaining stores will now get the service over the coming months so keep an eye out if your local Wilko currently doesn't offer it.  Shoppers will be able to order items for click & collect for free. In comparison, Wilko currently charges £4.95 for standard delivery and £7.96 for next day. Some orders will be ready for collection in just three hours. There is no minimum spend however not all items will be available for click & collect.  Products that have an age restriction on them will not be available for collection. Stock will vary from store to store so do shop around for the best deal and check if the item you want is available. Shoppers will have seven days from when the order is placed to collect their goods.  If you are unable to collect your order then Wilko will refund you.  Ben Exall, digital director at Wilko, said: “This is an exciting addition to wilko.com and offers customers more flexibility than ever when it comes to shopping with us."" In January, Wilko announced that it was reducing the amount of toys available in its stores.  It says it will be focusing more on household and garden products, which prove more popular with customers. Wilko will be making the change gradually across all of its UK stores. But shoppers will still be able to buy selected toys online. Other major retailers have been launching click & collect services to help make the shopper experience easier.  Primark opened a click & collect service in 25 stores last year as part of a trial.  The stores participating in the click and collect trial are located across the North West of England, Yorkshire and Wales. In January Aldi ditched Deliveroo deliveries and in December began concentrating on its click-and-collect service that’s currently from 200 stores. While rival Lidl was steadfastly shunning online sales, Hurley says ""watch this space"" when it comes to rolling out click and collect further. Do you have a money problem that needs sorting?

Households warned to redeem £325 supermarket vouchers now ahead of deadline next week – how to claim,"THOUSANDS of families have just a week left to redeem £325 supermarket vouchers before they expire. The cash vouchers are provided through the Household Support Fund worth £421million. The scheme was first established last year, extended for the second time in the March budget and for a third time in November to help those on the lowest incomes with the rising cost of living. Each council gets a different portion of funding depending on the size of the catchment area, population, and need. The vouchers or grants on offer vary by location so you'll have to check to see what you can get and how your council will pay you. You'll usually need to be on a low income to receive the help. Thousands of residents in North Yorkshire will have received electronic vouchers to help pay for food and other essentials at supermarkets. But households have just a week left to redeem vouchers worth up to £325. Eligibility requirements for the scheme vary depending on where you live - so check directly with your council if you could get the cash help. In North Yorkshire, those receiving housing benefit on or between August 26 2022, and September 25 2022, who did not qualify for the second cost of living payment for people on low-income benefits or tax credits, should have received a single electronic voucher worth £325. The second cost of living payment was paid in November to people getting Universal Credit, income support, pension credit, income-based jobseekers allowance, income-related employment and support allowance, child tax credit and working tax credit. And those getting the maximum discount to pay their council tax bill through the means-tested council tax reduction scheme as of November 30 2022, should have received a single electronic voucher worth £85. Those living in North Yorkshire do not need to apply for the cash help. Anyone eligible was sent a letter by January, 16. The letter will contain all the information needed about how to claim and use the electronic vouchers. The e-vouchers need to be redeemed ahead of the deadline of 15 February - but you'll be able to spend the value on them after this date. To redeem the voucher, you'll need to visit the North Yorkshire Council website and enter your voucher code in an online form. Residents of North Yorkshire are able to spend the value of these vouchers at supermarkets, including Aldi, Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury's. Some supermarkets also accept them when shopping online as well as in-store. You can check the full list on North Yorkshire's website. As part of the Autumn Statement, it was revealed millions on benefits and Universal Credit will receive an extra one-off £900. Eight million households currently get cost-of-living payments worth up to £650, but eligibility criteria could change under any new rules. Pensioners have also started getting a £300 one-off payment. The current pensioner cost of living payment is being handed out to millions on a low income. You qualify under the current rules if you normally get the winter fuel payment, but this could change under the new rules. The £300 cost of living payment is paid on top of the other winter support. You'll need to be: Struggling families are eligible for the Warm House Discount to help them tackle the cost of living. The scheme is where eligible households can get £150 off their electricity bill each winter - but you'll have to wait until the colder months to get the money off. Households in England and Wales don't need to apply to get the cash and they'll automatically qualify if they are receiving certain benefits. You can read more about who's eligible in our guide. There are also plenty of energy grants and schemes open to help you out if you're struggling: There's also a one-off fuel voucher from your energy supplier if you're on a prepayment meter.

Warning for all parents with an iPhone – you must do Apple’s ‘triple check’ today,"APPLE has reminded iPhone owners of some important tips to keep kids safe. The tech giant has long had a number of free tools available on iOS to help parents protect their children. But now the firm is warning adults once more to mark Safer Internet Day. “At Apple, our goal is to provide people with technology that not only improves and enriches their lives, but also helps them stay safe online,” said Erik Neuenschwander, Apple’s director of User Privacy. Here are three ways you can tighten iPhone and iPad settings to make things safer for young ones. Family Sharing is a special tool built by Apple that lets you create a family group. You can then manage it to help protect your children. You'll need to add each child to the Family Sharing group first. Once you've added a child to your Family Sharing group, you can select the parental controls as you see fit. Then, when you're setting up a device – like an iPhone – for a child you can add age restrictions for content. This works across apps, books, TV shows and movies. You can also set time limits for specific apps. There's an option to restrict who your kid can chat to as well. Best of all, you can make it so you personally approve any requests by the child to make a purchase – or even download something for free. If you want to edit any Family Sharing settings later, go back into Settings > Name > Family Sharing. For instance, there's a built-in Screen Time section that lets you manage downtime, app use, contacts and content ratings. Screen time is a great way to limit how long your child spends on their devices. You can set it up by going to Settings and finding Screen Time. Select Turn On Screen Time, then the blue button which also says Turn On Screen Time. Next, tap This is My Child's iPhone (or iPad). Here you can select which content you wish for them to be able to access - Apple offers a bit of help if you say their age. But the best bit is time away from screens, where you can set a downtime period where the device won't work, such as between 9pm and 7am when they should be asleep. You can also set app and website limits for specific categories of your choosing. You can prevent young ones from getting hold of some things not meant for their age, like music or TV shows with swearing. It works if the content has a specific rating in place - which all apps must carry. Go to Settings, then Screen Time. Tap Content & Privacy Restrictions, then Content Restrictions. Choose the settings you want for each feature or setting under Allowed Store Content. Looking for tips and hacks for your phone? Want to find those secret features within social media apps?

Parents terrified as balaclava ‘maniac’ stalks school children and tries to mow them down in car,"PARENTS are terrified fearing a 'killer' maniac in a balaclava mask is stalking schoolchildren in a sleepy town. He leapt out of a car and punched three children going to school in Beccles, Suffolk. The assault on the kids took place around 8.15am by the Premier Store at Castle Hill on February 2. The kids are thought to go to SET School for 600 pupils aged 11 to 16. Police say it was ""not a random attack"" and they are linking it to another incident four days earlier. As they stepped up their hunt for the man today, parents are frightened for the safety of their children. One mum said ""It's like this maniac is deliberately targeting pupils from the school. ""I've got a child there and it's terrifying to think there is someone on the prowl out there, waiting to harm our children."" A man wearing a balaclava jumped out of a car passenger seat and punched them as they cowered in fear. The school's headteacher Neil Ketteringham said ""Our primary concern is always the safety of our students, so the recent news is very concerning and shocking to us. ""We are going above and beyond to ensure this by having eight to ten staff members monitoring the area before and after school. ""And we have also been working closely with Suffolk Police in their investigations to ensure the perpetrator can be brought to justice."" A previous incident saw a car drive at a pupil crossing the road near the school, in an apparent bid to run him down which could have killed him. A police spokesperson said of the attack on the three pupils ""It doesn't appear to be a random assault and our investigations continue."" Suffolk county councillor Caroline Topping, who lives in the town, said ""It is ""totally unacceptable that young people, walking to school, should be subject to this sort of behaviour and assault."" Anyone who can help with the investigations is asked to contact Suffolk Police at 101. The crime reference for the assault is 37/6485/23 and the crime reference for the January 30 attempted hit-and-run incident is 37/6467/23.

Nicola Bulley cops hit back at private diving expert and say ‘human mole’ does NOT know all details of investigation,"POLICE have hit back at the diving expert assisting the search for missing Nicola Bulley - saying he does not know all the details. Peter Faulding has told multiple news outlets he thinks the mum-of-two is not in the River Wyre, before later changing his opinion and saying she is. The founder of private forensic searchers Specialist Group International (SGI) was drafted in on Monday to search the river bed with Sonar but has found no trace of the 45-year-old. At a press conference in St Andrew's on Wyre village hall last night, superintendent Sally Riley stressed the diver was not party to all the details of their wider investigation. The Lancashire Constabulary cop explained: ""Our search has not found Nicola in the river and then a re-search in parts by SGI has found the same.  ""That does not mean… that Nicola has not been in the river. “In the light of other inquiries being discounted from the investigation so far… clearly our main belief is that Nicola did fall into the river. “Clearly Mr Faulding isn’t included within all the investigation detail any more than the members of the public are that I’m briefing through these sorts of press conferences.” Mr Faulding - who is offering his services for free - has previously alleged ""third party"" involvement in Nicola's January 27 disappearance. He has even claimed Nicola's phone - discovered on a bench still connected to a meeting - could be a ""decoy"". Speaking to The Sun on Tuesday afternoon, having earlier said his ""gut feeling"" was that Nicola is not in the river, he backtracked, saying he now believed she was. After being slapped down last night, Mr Faulding, whose firm are based in Surrey, blasted superintendent Sally Riley's comments. He said: ""If there's any more facts that we don't know about - normally we work along the side of the police and if you haven't got the facts then you can't conduct a proper search. ""It is very difficult without that information. Normally, I'm privy to that information… it would be useful to know."" Superintendent Riley also warned ""amateur detectives"" - some of which have reportedly broken into homes to try and find evidence of the mum - they will be arrested if caught. She added: ""There are some properties along the riverside which are empty or derelict and whilst it may be well-intentioned that people think that that could be a line of inquiry, I would ask them to desist from doing that. ""In some cases it may be criminal if they are breaking in, causing damage or committing a burglary."" Monday's search for Nicola focused downstream on the tidal area of the River Wyre but Tuesday's search took place further upstream. It included and went beyond the area where Nicola's belongings were found on a bench near Garstang Road, in St Michael's on Wyre. It is a non-tidal area of the river. Mr Faulding, who nicknamed himself the ""Human Mole"" after developing expertise in underground searches, added: ""If Nicola is in the river, she could have even fallen further up, we don't know."" SGI will continue their search with the £55,000 sonar equipment on Wednesday. Other dive teams started to look further upriver towards Fleetwood and the Irish Sea on Tuesday. It comes as cops focus search efforts on a track from the fields, where Nicola was last seen, to Garstang Road in St Michael's on Wyre. Lancashire Constabulary said on Tuesday they believe this route may hold vital clues and have appealed to drivers and cyclists to come forward with any dashcam footage from the morning of January 27 when the mum vanished. In a statement, the force said they used data from the mum's Fitbit fitness watch and mobile phone to scale up efforts on the path. They added: ""We have also spoken to numerous witnesses... and searched the derelict house on the other side of the river as well as any empty caravans in the vicinity.""

"I was branded with Andrew Tate’s name… he lured me to Romania, strangled me and made me perform on cam, says Brit","ANDREW Tate's ex-girlfriend has told how she was branded with a tattoo of his name.  The anonymous Brit woman - named only as Sophie - alleged she was slapped, strangled and subjected to sexual violence by Tate after he lured her to Romania.  Sophie claimed she was pulled in by the promise of romance after first striking up a relationship with Tate on Facebook. The former model alleged she was tightly controlled by Tate - with him even ""fining"" her if she went out with friends without his permission.  Sophie was speaking out on BBC radio show File on 4. A spokesman for Tate denied all the allegations and insisted all sexual behaviour was  ""consensual"" when speaking to The Sun Online.  Sophie claims was eventually able to escape from Tate - and said she was not surprised when he was arrested last year in Romania.  ""I knew, I said to all my friends, it's a matter of time before they figure out what was going on,"" she said.  Tate and his brother Tristan remain in prison as prosecutors and police investigate his dealings, including allegations of rape against Andrew.  Sophie initially describes a very positive relationship with the ""charming"" Tate. But after she moved to Romania to be with him, he allegedly became controlling, violent and she was lured into his webcam operation. She even described how she was pressured to get a tattoo of Tate's name on her arm. ""There was another girl that had one done, he was sending me pictures of it,"" she said. ""It felt like something I had to do."" Tate would ""chip away"" at her until she finally agreed to perform on webcam for him. ""If you love me, you would do it, if you care about me, you would do it,"" Tate would allegedly tell Sophie. Sophie claims she would do everything she could to keep Tate happy, but the controlling behaviour and violence became worse. ""[Tate] held me up against the wall and he slapped me really hard and followed it with 'you w***e',"" she told the BBC. She said that Tate wanted to feel ""completely in control"".  Sophie says she was intent on ""pleasing"" Tate. And she alleges that he used to strangle her, including on one occasion that left her passed out - causing Tate to panic.  Sophie says she was left mentally ""broken"" by the relationship.  She described how after she flew out to Romania - she spent a few days with with Tate only for him to then vanish in the middle of the night.  ""I don't feel like a victim, all the choices I made were of my free will, he didn't bundle me up in a bag, throw me in a back of a lorry and drive me there,"" said Sophie. ""But at what point does the emotional or psychological manipulation turn into being forced to do something?"" Prosecutors claim Tate would groom his alleged victims using the so-called ""lover boy"" method - convincing women he wanted a relationship with them before making them perform on cam.  She went on: ""Everyone has been in love before, everyone knows the power of that emotion and the things you do for it. ""Any kind of rationale or logic leaves your body and you find yourself doing things you wouldn't normally do - and this is one of those situations.""  Tate has previously bragged he had 75 women working for him, earning him approximately £500,000 a month. He built up an image that appealed to teenage boys - creating an online empire that made him one of the most searched people on Google. He showed off expensive cars, hung out with glamorous women, and smoked cigars. Masquerading as lifestyle advice, much of the content is actually highly sexist and promotes violence against women. His influence has had a worrying spread amongst young men and boys, with one UK MP saying he is ""brainwashing"" children. Now many of his cars have been locked up by Romanian cops, who have seized more than £3million worth of assets from him. Tate initially gained fame after a short-lived appearance on Big Brother. He was dumped from the reality show after alleged footage of him beating a woman emerged online. Since then he has sparked revulsion and outrage with a wave of warped content online. Labour MP Alex Davies-Jones called on the UK Government to take action on the spread of Tate's content - with teachers already revealing a worrying spread in schools. ""Schools across the UK are in crisis as the effect of online influencer Andrew Tate’s vile misogyny infiltrates our classrooms and society,"" said Ms Davies Jones MP. ""Teachers are now having to develop their own resources to re-educate boys who are being brainwashed online by his deeply toxic messaging."" Washington DC-born Tate was banned from Twitter in 2017 for violating its terms of service with his controversial comments. In August, Tate was banned from a range of other social media sites - only to then be reinstated on Twitter after the company was taken over by Elon Musk. In a statement, a spokesman for Tate said: ""Andrew denies all accusations that featured in the File on 4 documentary on BBC Radio 4.  ""The allegations of sexual violence have been taken out of context as this was consensual between both parties.""   ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21313203/andrew-tate-romania-tattoo-perform/
Bodybags pile up in Turkey with at least 11k dead after mega-quake ‘that MOVED country 10ft’… as Sun readers raise £295k,"BODYBAGS are beginning to pile up in Turkey as the death toll from the earthquake passes 11,200 - while generous Sun pledge nearly £300,000 to aid rescue efforts. The massive 7.8 magnitude quake stuck early on Monday with such force that it is believed to have shifted the country by up to 10ft. Two further massive earthquakes and dozens of smaller tremors struck in the 24 hours after the initial quake, leaving a trail of destruction stretching for hundreds of miles along Turkey’s border with Syria. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has declared a three-month state of emergency in quake epicentre, Gaziantep, and nine other cities. Desperate searches are taking place to find survivors buried underneath the rubble of the thousands of buildings destroyed. Harrowing images show body bags laid out on the road and it's feared the death toll could eventually reach 20,000. Such is the scale of disaster that some bodies had to covered with blankets after bags ran out at one hospital. ""People are dying every second - we are in a race against time,""  said Mohammed Shibli, from Syria's White Helmets civil defence group, who are leading the rescue efforts in the country. Professor Carlo Doglioni, president of the Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, said the earthquake moved Turkey by 3 metres - around 10ft. “What we call the Arabian plate moved about 3 meters along the northeast-southwest direction relative to the Anatolian plate,"" he told Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera. “We are talking about a structure in the border region between this world, that of the Arabian plate and that of the Anatolian plate.” Big-hearted  Sun readers have so far raised £295,000 in response to the devastation. All money from the Sun Earthquake Appeal will be donated to the British Red Cross for a major on-the-ground mobilisation.

Convictions for evil people smugglers HALVE despite surge in small boat crossings,"CONVICTIONS for people trafficking have more than HALVED - as small boat crossings skyrocket.  Damning stats show migrant crossing soar to new highs but just 135 banged up - as smugglers rake in staggering £183 million from illegal journeys. As migrant Channel crossings soared to new highs of 45,000 last year, just 135 were charged with illegal offences of helping people make the dangerous journey. Meanwhile, sick smugglers have raked in a staggering £183million from facilitating the journeys - which cost an average of £4k each. In the year ending June 2019, 254 people were convicted, but that plummeted down to just 135 last year, according to new stats revealed by Labour. This year could see 65,000 people make the dangerous trip across the Channel, some modelling has predicted. Some 262 have already made the dangerous journey since the start of the month, with another 1,300 in January despite freezing temperatures. Shadow Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper blasted: “It is unforgivable that the Conservatives have completely failed to crackdown on the criminal gangs who are profiting from the small boat crossings.""  A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We have arrested more than 320 people since we strengthened the law in June last year, and we remain committed to removing those who flout our laws. ""We are working tirelessly to crack down on these evil people smugglers risking the lives of vulnerable people for profit, using every tool at our disposal to deter illegal migration.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/21315121/convictions-for-evil-people-smugglers-halve/
18 locations where council tax is set to rise by up to 15% in weeks adding £295 a year to bills,"HOUSEHOLDS up and down the country will be stung with council tax hikes of up to 15%, adding up to £295 to bills. Councils were given the green light in last year's Autumn Statement to raise the levy by as much as 5% from April. But some authorities have been allowed to hike bills even more than this - in some cases, by as much as 15%. Local authorities were previously only allowed to raise council tax by 2.99% - anything higher would have required a local vote. The amount you'll pay is determined by the local council and depends on which ""band"" the property you live in falls under. Your home's band is based on its value - the more expensive the property, the more council tax will be charged. We list 18 locations where councils have approved bumping up rates, and explain how much you'll be paying. Croydon Council has been given permission to hike council tax bills by 15%. That's because the local authority is currently battling to pay off £1.6billion of debt. Residents on council tax band D pay £1965.66 a year, which means a 15% rise would add an extra £294.85 to bills. Households could therefore be paying £2260.51 a year from April. The council said it plans to ""increase the support"" given to those on low incomes, and we've asked the authority to share details of what this help could look like. Aside from Croydon Council's mega 15% hike planned, London councils can increase bills by 10%. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has set out plans to increase council tax to fund an extra 500 Police Community Support Officers. He is planning to raise the precept - his share of council tax bills - £38.55 a year from April for the average band D properties. The precept is a separate amount that the major can add to everyone's council tax bills to help for services provided by the Great London Authority (GLA0). The Mayor is proposing to increase his share of council tax bills from £395.59 a year to £434.14 for Band D households. This is for residents of the 32 boroughs – an overall increase of £38.55. Plymouth City Council is in talks over a council tax increase of 2.99%. On top of that, the authority is also considering a 2% precept to pay for social care. That could mean a rise of 4.99% in total. The average annual council tax bill for a home in Plymouth is currently £2,008.23. A 4.99% rise would see bills increase by £100.21 to £2,108.44. Residents in Slough Borough Council's catchment area could be hit with a council tax bill sting of 9.99%. Berkshire council is reportedly facing a £760million hole in their books. The council said that additional support will be given to more than 9,000 households who qualify for a council tax reduction. We've asked for more info on what this support looks like and will update this story when we know more. Residents pay an average of £1,850.09 a year for their council tax currently. A nearly 10% increase would make this jump to £2034.91, adding £184.82 a year to bills. Bedford Borough Council is considering a council tax increase of 2.9%. This includes a core council tax increase of 0.9% as well as 2% for the government's Adult Social Care precept. The increase would mean an average Band D council tax of £1,737.92. This is an increase of £50.39, with bills currently standing at £1687.53. Residents in a Band D property will see a 3.2% jump to their council tax if they live in Stratford Upon Avon. The Band D rate will now be £159.12 for the 2023/2024 tax year. If you live in the Stratford Upon Avon District Council Catchment area, your bill will also include charges made up by your parish or town council, Warwickshire County Council and Warwickshire Police. The average Band D council tax bill in the region stands at £2,007.76. North Yorkshire Council's proposed budget could see council tax bills rise by 4.99%. This would be an increase of £83.64 a year for an average Band D property. The current Band D council tax bill in the region is £1,467.35. This could go up to £1,550.99. A council tax rise of 4.99% is in the works for Lincolnshire residents. The jump compromises a 2.99% increase in council tax and a further 2% increase in the adult social care levy. How much you pay for your council tax depends on who your local council is. For example, those living in the City of Lincoln Council area pay an average of £1,999.26 a year. A 4.99% jump means residents will be paying £2099.02 a year, which is £99.76 more. Skegness Town Council is considering increasing its precept by 5.42%. This will increase the Parish's precept - its portion of the Council Tax bill - to £106.48 for Band D property. This is an increase of around 11p per week on last year's charge - or £5.72 a year. The rest of the council tax bill will also include East Lindsey District Council, Lincolnshire County Council and Lincolnshire Police. Bradford District Council is proposing an increase of 4.99%. The bill for a Band D property currently stands at £1,837.39. This means the annual bill could jump by around £73.49. But households, depending on where they are located, will also have parish or town councils precepts added to their bills. You should check the council website to see if this applies to you. Colchester City Council is considering a 3% rise in council tax. This would be an increase of its precept, which is also made up of contributions to Essex County Council, fire and rescue and police. An annual council tax bill for a Band D home is currently £1900.44. East Sussex County Council has approved a 4.99% council tax bill hike. Depending on which catchment area you fall under, your bill will vary. For example, the average council tax bill in Hastings Borough Council is £2,219.29. That means a 4.99% increase would take annual bills to £2330.03 - which is £110.74 more. Coventry City Council is considering raising council tax by 3% and an adult social care precept of 2%. This would mean a rise of 5%. The final council tax increase will be subject to council approval next month. Haringey London Borough Council is considering increasing council tax by 1.99%. This is a rise in the amount of money the borough requires from taxpayers in the area. A Band D property currently pays £1,879.72 a year in council tax. This is split between the Greater London Authority, adult social care precept and Haringey. Council tax for a Band D property is currently £1,820, rising to around £1,910 - a £90 increase. Nottingham City Council is considering raising council tax by 5% - including a 2% precept towards adult social care costs. This would be an increase of around £102.57. A Band D council tax bill is currently £2,225.76. A 4.99% council tax increase has been rubber-stamped by this local authority. Exactly where you live in this catchment area will dictate how much your bill will be. Those living in Binfield pay an average of £1,835.98 a year. A 4.99% increase means bills will jump by £91.62 a year to £1927.60. Derby City Council is considering a rise of 4.99%, with 2% of this made up of the adult social care precept. This means a household living in a Band D home would be likely to see their bill increase by £78.74 a year. A household currently living in Band D property pays £1,698.10 currently. This could increase to £1,776.84. Newham Council's draft budget proposal includes a potential council tax rise of 4.99%. This would work out than an average Band D property in Newham would pay around £1.09 a week more. But this does not include other charges in the council tax bill. A current Band D council tax bill in the area is £1,532.26. This includes contributions to Newham Council, adult social care charges and the Greater London Authority. Councils publish their budget plans for the 2023/24 financial year. This will detail any council tax rises planned. Keep an eye on your council's website for information on this. Check which council tax band your property falls under to work out how much the increase will cost you. You can find your local authority by using the gov.uk search tool. You'll then be sent a council tax bill in April outlining how much you need to pay. Residents can choose to make payments over a period of 10 months. You can also opt to pay instalments over 12 months if you prefer - although you won't benefit from a pause in payments at the end of 2022. There are a number of discounts you could get - but they will vary depending on your circumstances. Factors such as your household income, whether you have children, and if you receive any benefits, will influence what you get. To apply for any of the below discounts, go through the government website. You'll need your national insurance number, bank statements, a recent payslip or letter from the Jobcentre, and a passport or driving licence when filling out the details. If you are not sure which local authority you live in, you can check the government's council locator to find out. If you live on your own, you can get 25% off your council tax bill. This also applies if there is one adult and one student living together in a property, or if there is one adult and one person classed as severely mentally impaired in the home. If you live with someone who doesn't have to pay council tax, such as a carer or someone who is severely mentally impaired, you could get a larger reduction too, of up to 50%. And, if you live in an all-student household, you could get a 100% discount. A full list of circumstances that exempt you from paying council tax can be found on Citizens Advice. Pensioners may also find themselves eligible for a council tax reduction. If you receive the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit, you could get a 100% discount. If not, you could still get help if you have a low income and less than £16,000 in savings. And a pensioner who lives alone will be entitled to a 25% discount too. If you are on a low income or receiving benefits, you could eligible for a reduction on your council tax. Whether you are eligible will vary depending on where you live. You could also get a deferral if you're struggling to pay your bill, or you can speak to your council about setting up a payment plan to manage the cost. But one thing to remember is if you are struggling you should contact your council as early as you can. You might be able to reduce the amount of council tax you pay by challenging your band. Properties across the UK are put into a band from A to H, and this informs how much council tax you pay. The bands were created based on property values back in 1991, so many households may find that based on today's prices, they should be in a different band. It's worth checking yours to see if you could get a discount. First, you need to find out what band you are in. You can find this out by checking with your local authority or on the postcode checker. Use the council tax band checker tool to see which band properties along your street are in. If they are in a lower band than you are, you could successfully make a challenge and get yours lowered. Contact the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) in England and Wales or the Scottish Assessors Association (SAA) in Scotland to do this. Gather together evidence showing you're paying more - this could be having addresses of similar properties to yours in a lower band, for example. If the VOA agrees that your property is in the wrong band, it will contact you to let you know your band will be changed. It can take up to two months for the VOA to review your case. But be warned - challenging your band might not work. While you could get moved to a lower band and pay less, there's also the chance the VOA could find you're not paying enough. This could mean you're moved to a higher band - and your neighbours' too. If you disagree with the VOA's ruling, you can appeal your case - but only if you've been told that you can when you get the decision. You must appeal within three months of your decision - to do this, get in touch with the Valuation Tribunal Service. If the Valuation Tribunal agrees with you, it will get the VOA to change your band - and your bill will change. If you're not eligible for a council tax discount - or you can't move bands - there are other ways to get help. You can make an application for what is called ""discretionary relief"" for your council tax bill by filling out a Section 13A application. This means councils can reduce or completely wipe off a council tax debt you might have. A Sun investigation last year found that councils have been wiping clean a record level of council tax debt in recent years over the Covid pandemic. Nearly £2.7million worth of council tax debts was scrapped by local authorities over 2020/21. Ask your council for the Section 13A form. Once you’ve sent your Section 13A application over to your local authority, you should be told about a decision within 14 days. Thousands of homeowners have moved house and are unaware they are still paying council tax bills. A whopping £33.7million is sitting in closed or dormant council tax accounts, according to data analysed by The Sun. The highest amount owed back was £27,150 to one household from St Alban’s Council. Larger councils are likely to have a higher amount of unclaimed credit because of the higher number of people living in their catchment areas. Contact your council if you think you’re owed. Many authorities have different procedures when it comes to dishing out refunds. While some give them out automatically usually, in some cases you have to apply for a refund.

Inside Nasa’s brand new futuristic aircraft which has no front window for pilots to see ahead,"NASA has unveiled an experimental aircraft which makes people think pilots will be flying blind at sonic speeds.  But the US space agency's highly trained pilots will instead be using augmented reality to navigate ""crowded"" airspace, Nasa said in a statement.  The X-59 Quiet SuperSonic Technology plane uses a new system which replaces a pilot's direct line of sight.  This can help pilots spot other aircrafts faster than they could through a regular windshield, according to Nasa test pilot Jim Less.  Less has been trying out the new aircraft, which has a distinct 38-foot nose designed to make it more aerodynamic at incredibly high speeds.  The goal of the X-59 is to lower the sound of the sonic boom that comes with travelling faster than the speed of sound, according to Nasa.  ""If successful, the test flights could lead the way to dramatically reducing flight times with the resumption of overland supersonic flight,"" Nasa explained. The unique nose of the plane means the pilot will sit closer to the middle of the aircraft without a front-facing windshield. The External Vision System uses two cameras, image-processing software and a computer that brings together new and existing technology to give pilots an ultra-realistic augmented reality display.  It is ""almost like looking out the windows,” said Less.  The monitor is around four times the resolution of tradition high definition (HD) screens that many people are used to.  The display can switch to different channels which show different parts of the sky.  These channels can switch at eyewatering speeds - matching that of a single honeybee wing flap, or five milliseconds.  One unnamed helicopter manufacturer is currently using the new technology to add a 4K video display to a number of its models.  These helicopters are used for emergency medical services, public services, offshore energy, commercial transport, and private aviation. Looking for tips and hacks for your phone?

WhatsApp update changes how phone calls work forever – but there’s a catch,"WHATSAPP is working on a brand new feature that will make Groups even more annoying - depending on how you feel about calls anyway. The popular chat app is making it possible to schedule calls. So it might be harder to make an excuse to get out of some big family call you'd rather avoid next time around. Conversely, it'll make things a lot easier for people with busy schedules. WhatsApp expert site WABetaInfo leaked an early screenshot of the new feature. It shows a brand new button at the top of the Group chat where you can hit schedule call. This opens a popup, which asks you to set a title, date and time. ""Members of the group will be notified when the call is scheduled and when it starts,"" the box says. It's only an early test build of the new feature though, so there's no telling when - and if - it'll launch on the main WhatsApp everyone uses anytime soon. Not even beta testers have had a chance to use it yet. But if you want to be first, joining the beta programme is your best chance. To download WhatsApp beta for your smartphone you need to go to Google Play on your Android and search for WhatsApp. Scroll down the page until you see ""Become a Beta Tester"". Tap the ""I'm In"" button and then click ""Join"" to confirm. Now all you have to do is wait for the update to the beta version of the app. Joining the WhatsApp beta on iOS is more difficult, and has limited capacity. Follow Apple’s guide here.

UK weather: Date snow could fall as Met Office warn ‘sudden stratospheric warming’ will bring icy conditions,"BRITS are bracing for snow as the Met Office warns ""sudden stratospheric warming"" could bring more icy weather. The UK was hit by freezing fog this morning bringing delays to roads and flight cancellations. And a yellow warning for snow and ice covers the north of Scotland from 4pm today to 9am tomorrow. Drivers were warned to take extra care on the roads due to reduced visibility. And icy conditions may well continue, with the Met Office warning of an imminent ""sudden stratospheric warming"" (SSW). The forecaster's website states: ""The latest forecasts are showing that a major SSW is now likely to take place.  ""The recent minor SSW weakened the SPV and it’s now likely to collapse and reverse in the middle of February."" An SSW refers to a sudden warming up in the stratosphere, the area found between six and 30 miles above the earth’s surface.  It is so high up that we do not feel it, but it has a knock-on effect to the jet stream - which affects weather down below. The Met Office have said there is an 80% chance of a major SSW occurring, and this will likely impact our weather at the end of February or the start of March. SSWs have happened before. The Beast from the East in February 2018 was sparked by an SSW. And while this could bring snow and ice again, it is not guaranteed to. The Met Office added: ""However,  not all SSWs lead to cold weather and widespread snow for the UK, for example, the SSW in February 2018 led to the ‘beast from the east’ whereas the SSW in January 2019 had no significant impact for the UK weather, in fact, it stayed mild for the rest of the winter."" Prof Adam Scaife, head of long-range forecasting at the Met Office, said: “There is now over 80% chance of a major SSW occurring. “Although the impact will become clearer nearer the time, any effect on UK weather is most likely to occur in late February and March.” It comes as freezing fog sparked travel chaos this morning for Brits as flights were cancelled. The forecaster warned of delays to journeys and flight cancellations - with visibility as low as 50 metres in parts. More than a dozen flights at London City Airport were called off today.

Nicola Bulley’s partner Paul Ansell visits scene with dive expert who feared missing mum had been abducted,"MISSING Nicola Bulley's partner today visited the scene where she vanished to speak to a dive expert leading a river search. Nicola, 45, was last seen in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, at around 9.15am on January 27. Since then, there has been no trace of the mum with the search now on its 12th day. Nicola's partner Paul Ansell today visited the scene where specialist divers are using sonar to scour a river. He was pictured talking to Peter Faulding, who is leading the search, along with one of Nicola's friends and a detective. The forensic expert told the dad ""she's not here"" as the group stood on the spot where Nicola was last seen. It came after police hit out at dive expert Peter, who runs Specialist Group International (SGI). He told multiple news outlets he believed Nicola is not in the River Wyre and suggested she may have been abducted. The expert even asked Paul if Nicola had any ""enemies"" after at one stage fearing she may have been abducted. But speaking to The Sun yesterday, he backtracked and said he now believed she was in the water. Lancashire Police said previously their “main working hypothesis” is that Nicola had “sadly fallen in the river”. Supt Sally Riley said: ""Clearly Mr Faulding isn’t included within all the investigation detail any more than the members of the public are that I’m briefing through these sorts of press conferences.” The force confirmed yesterday they are keeping an ""open mind"" over her disappearance. But Supt Riley said investigators have not yet detected a ""suspicious"" element in Nicola's disappearance. She added: ""Every third party element or criminal element has been looked into and discounted."" Police were also forced to warn amateur detectives from trespassing in empty properties. The officer urged the public not to ""take matters into their own hands"" and refrain from speculating online as it could ""hurt"" Nicola's family. She added: ""Nor is it helpful if people, particularly if they have come from outside of the area, take it upon themselves to take the law into their own hands by trying to, for example, break into empty property. ""They may mean well, they may want to help. But they can help in thinking back if they were in the area to what information they may have of relevance to the police and holding the family in their thoughts. ""But we will not tolerate online abuse of anyone, including innocent witnesses, members of the family and friends, of local businesses, or of criminal damage or burglary. We will be taking a strong line on that, as you would expect."" Supt Sally Riley also explained the details surrounding the mammoth inquiry. She said there are 500 ""active"" pieces of information and lines of inquiry police are investigating - but ""nothing of note"" has been found yet. Officers are speaking to the drivers of 700 vehicles that drove through the village at around 9.10am/9.15am on the morning Nicola vanished. Supt Riley said the search is ""complex"" as the river can be fast-moving with parts of the water tidal. She added: ""It remains our belief that Nicola fell into the river and that this is a missing person inquiry. ""We are fully open minded to any information that indicates where Nicola is and what happened to her."" Officers previously revealed more about Nicola's final movements as they issued an update on her disappearance. They said she did not leave the field where she was walking Willow via Rowanwater, either through the site itself or via the piece of land at the side. Nicola also did not return to the fields along Allotment Lane or via the path at the rear of the Grapes pub onto Garstang Road. Officers are now focusing on a river path that leads from the fields back to Garstang Road and are appealing for drivers to come forward. Anyone who travelled down the road on that day will also receive a letter from police requesting dashcam footage. A timeline has been made by police of the missing mum’s final movements before she disappeared. Nicola began her walk along the towpath to the River Wyre at 8.43am after dropping her two children off at school. Police say around seven minutes later, a dog walker who knows Nicola saw her walking around the lower field with her springer spaniel Willow. The witness said their two dogs interacted briefly before she left Nicola via the river path. At 8.53am, the mum sent an email to her boss at Exclusively Mortgages. She then logged into a Teams call at 9.01am and was seen around nine minutes later on the upper field walking Willow. Police say at 9.30am, the work call ended but Nicola stayed logged on. At around 9.35am, the mobile and Willow were found at a bench by the river but there was no sign of Nicola. Nicola has been described as white, 5ft 3ins tall with light-brown shoulder-length hair. She was last seen wearing an ankle-length black quilted gilet jacket with a black Engelbert Strauss waist-length coat underneath and black tight-fitting jeans. She had long green walking socks tucked into her jeans, ankle-length green Next wellies, a necklace and a pale blue Fitbit on. Nicola has an Essex accent and links to the Thornton-Cleveleys area near Blackpool. Anybody with information about where she might be is asked to call 101, quoting log 473 of January 27, or ring 999 for immediate sightings.

We live in tiny rural town where raunchy Outlander was filmed – rich Americans love it & the area is overrun by tourists,"RESIDENTS of a tiny village where raunchy TV show Outlander was filmed say the area is loved by rich Americans - and overrun by tourists. Culross, a rural town in Fife, Scotland, is home to only 400 people. But since the saucy period drama was filmed there, the village has been inundated by a ""huge number"" of visitors. Rich Americans have even snapped up shares in 600-year-old village pub the Red Lion. The historical drama stars Caitríona Balfe as Claire Randall - a former Second World War military nurse in Scotland. In 1945 she finds herself transported back in time to 1743. There she encounters, falls in love with and marries a dashing Highland warrior named Jamie Fraser, played by Sam Heughan. Red Lion Landlord Mike Brown, 51, said: ""The Outlander cast are in and out of the village quite a lot. ""The village itself dates back to 1510 and there's around 400 people living here. ""We are very busy for tourists - even in December, January, February. ""A lot of shareholders are Americans, they love Outlander. ""We get a lot of people who want to stand at the bar and take photos. ""We are quite a big success story, I don't know why. ""People are coming from all over Britain to ask how we have done it. He added: ""The TV link does help. The tourist interest in Outlander is massive. ""We get a huge amount of tourists all year round."" The Red Lion had previously been at risk after it piled up debt and its owners decided to sell up. But the local community took over the pub before leasing it to Mike, who has worked there for 24 years. He said: ""When it was decided to do the buyout, I was asked if I would be interested in leasing it as I'd worked there 24 years. ""We managed to secure the funding and took over on July 4. ""We raised around £6,000 or £7,000 out of £950,000. ""There's still more to do but we have professional fundraisers on board. ""There's 28 staff and they're all local. We are very busy, there are tour groups coming in four or five times a week. ""There was another pub that closed and became a B&B so we needed to make sure it always remains a pub. ""One of the main things was to keep it open for the community. ""It has been an inn for nearly 600 years. ""What we pay in rent goes back into the community. ""We put it back into the village, whether for seniors or for toddlers, if there's things the council won't pay for. Mike's wife has worked at the Red Lion for decades and his daughter began working there 13 years ago, when she was 14 years old.

Sudden stratospheric warming: What is a polar vortex and how does it happen?,"A POLAR VORTEX can effect all different areas of the globe. It leads to extremely cold weather, but what else do we know about it and what causes it? A polar vortex can lead to the arrival of extremely low temperatures. It is a mass of desperately cold air that sits above the Earth’s north and south poles. This dense, cold air is controlled by a large pocket of low pressure, which rotates in an anti-clockwise direction at the North Pole and clockwise at the South Pole. A band of strong winds high up in the atmosphere - up to 30 miles above Earth - keeps bitterly cold air locked around the Arctic region. The winds regularly exceed 155 miles per hour.
 The term ""vortex"" in itself refers to the anti-clockwise flow of air helping to keep the colder air near the North Pole. The air moves in a clockwise direction at the South Pole. The polar vortex strengthens and weakens during winter.   When it undergoes changes and moves south, it can create alarmingly cold conditions. A strong polar vortex needs a strong jet stream, and gives stormy, wet weather. A jet stream is a narrow band of strong wind in the upper levels of the atmosphere. A weak polar vortex tends to lead to a weaker jet stream, which results in northerly or easterly winds in the UK bringing cold air from the Arctic. A weak vortex can split into two or more freezing vortices, covering a wide area including the US, Canada and Europe. The phenomenon associated with wintry weather is known as a Sudden Stratospheric Warming.
 In January 2023, Met Office forecasters warned of high-altitude polar vortex winds in Scotland. The winds are forecast to significantly weaken, resulting in a weakened jet stream which could see Arctic air plunging towards Scotland in a February freeze. The Beast from the East in 2018 was the last time Britain saw a polar vortex with freezing temperatures and bitter winds. At least 17 people across the UK died in the weather event. In January and February 2019, Chicago was one of the places worst affected by the polar vortex. The wind chill brought temperatures down as low as -29C, nearly 10 degrees colder than the 1985 record. Windchill temperatures reached -60C - colder than Antarctica. At least 21 people died across the country during the polar vortex-induced weather, according to Reuters. In fact it was so cold railway engineers had to set fire to train tracks to keep them from It always exists near the poles, but weakens in summer and strengthens in winter. People in the UK will rarely hear about a polar vortex unless it is heading towards them. We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

O2 and Tesco Mobile go down leaving customers without internet and unable to make calls,"HUNDREDS of O2 and Tesco Mobile customers have reported a network outage, leaving them unable to make or take calls. Problems started on Wednesday afternoon, with more than 618 issues logged by customers on the outage detection site Down Detector. And both the O2 and Tesco Mobile Twitter page is being bombarded by unhappy customers alerting the network provider that they're having issues. The most reported locations include Manchester and London. An unhappy Tesco Mobile customer Tweeted: ""@tescomobile Calls aren't working, but texts and data are. Why?"" ""@tescomobile is your network down? Both myself and my husband are unable to make or receive calls,"" said another. Frustrated O2 customers have also tweeted about the issue. One customer said: ""@O2 are there any issues currently in the Oldham area? Can't connect to the internet."" ""O2 can't call out. Is the signal down?"" said another. Tesco Mobile's services run off the O2 network, so it's no wonder that customers at both firms are facing issues. On social media, the customer services teams have been directing unhappy customers to the O2 Network Support page. This includes a live network status checker, which is supposed to show whether the network is working near you. If the status checker isn’t showing any issues in your area, O2 says you should try: We've contacted O2 and Tesco Mobile to confirm the issue and explain when it will be resolved. The O2 network last went down in February 2020 and left hundreds of customers without the ability to make calls and send texts. At that time, almost a thousand people across the country reported problems via Down Detector. There is compensation on offer if you are a customer affected by broadband outages. But this is unfortunately not usually the case for mobile networks. However, you may still be entitled to compensation from O2 or Tesco Mobile if you experience a mobile phone outage. O2 and Tesco Mobile have previously said any customers affected by outages can contact its customer service team who will look at compensation on a case-by-case basis. You can get in touch with O2 and Tesco Mobile by phone, post or online. You can also speak to O2 and Tesco Mobile via its live chat service. Other mobile phone companies such as Three have previously given customers up to £20 off their bills following a nine-hour signal failure. Ofcom says depending on the circumstances, your phone provider may have to offer you money back while repairs are being made leading to outages. And if repairs take longer, you may be entitled to an additional refund or account credit.   ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/21316411/o2-tesco-mobile-down-leaving-customers-without-internet-calls/
I’m a deals expert – little-known trick to get up to 75% off groceries every time you shop,"A SAVVY expert has a little-known trick that can get shoppers up to 75% off their groceries. The cost of living has forced everyone to tighten their purse strings. Food prices are going up and people will be looking for ways they can save money.  Tom Church, co-founder of money-saving hub Latest Deals, has a trick for customers to knock money off their food shop. He discovered a secret way to get grocery shopping for cheap online - and it's by shopping for nearly expired products. He said: ""Not many people know about this, but food, toiletries, health and beauty products are commonly sold for bargain prices on eBay if you know where to look."" Tom said he started looking online for websites that sell discount items, or items that are going out of date.  ""There are actually dozens of eBay stores in the UK which sell food that’s reduced to clear.  ""It’s been reduced because it’s either near its best before date, or is past it. ""Many of us may think we need to strictly follow best before dates, but this is just a guideline."" For a full list of items you can safely eat past their expiry date, check out our guide.  Tom said some of the food he has found on eBay include: When shopping, Tom said there are some search terms you can use to get the best results.  ""I discovered that the best words to use are - best before, BBE, BB, out of date, OOD, short date, short dated, expired and clearance.  ""You put the name of the product you want before one of these words - for example, you would search for Pringles out of date or Cadburys expired."" We've got the full list of clearance stores Tom found below, though do shop around for the best deal. Tom also said that you'll be typically buying in bulk, like Costco. Remember, it's only a steal if you were planning on purchasing it already.  Here's the full list of clearance stores, just search the name in the eBay search bar. In addition, Tom said shoppers can get extra discounts with eBay voucher codes. He said: ""You can sign up for vouchers and discounts via email by going to the customer service page.  ""Similarly, sellers will sometimes offer multi-buy savings.  ""I’ve also found that adding an item to your watch list can result in getting a special offer sent to your inbox."" Research what you need before you go.  Prices always vary by supermarket and it can pay to change up your shop. One shopper ditched going to supermarkets altogether in favour of their local wholesaler, that way they could stock up in bulk, at lower prices. You can also cash in on reduced foods like yellow sticker bargains - these will be items reduced because they're about to meet their best-before date. They'll still be safe to eat or freeze to make them last longer, but it means you can pick up the same products at an even cheaper price. Sometimes even timing your shop to stock up just as items are discounted on the shelves can help you get the best bargains - lots of shoppers have said this is in the evening typically. Most supermarkets have their own loyalty schemes which customers can sign up to earn points and get discounts on products. Tesco offers personalised coupons to its loyal customers through its Clubcard scheme. Asda Rewards allows customers to collect ""Asda pounds"" every time they buy Star Products and complete Missions in store. Meanwhile, Sainsbury's revamped the Nectar loyalty scheme in 2019 to also offer personalised discounts. Customers can see the deals on the website or app each week, and then collect the extra points if they buy the item in store or online. Morrisons shoppers can no longer collect points through the My Morrisons loyalty scheme after the scheme was overhauled in May 2021 and points collecting scrapped. Too Good To Go connects hungry Brits with food chains and supermarkets that have leftover food which would otherwise be thrown away, in a bid to curb food waste. With Too Good To Go, shoppers can buy the food at a discounted price, making sweet savings. Hard-up households can get free cash from their local council as part of the government's £421million Households Support Fund. The fund was extended until March 2023 to help the country's vulnerable households. And some councils offer supermarket vouchers for families who are struggling. Families that qualify for the Healthy Start scheme get one or two vouchers per week, per child, depending on how old each child is. These cards can be used for supermarket shopping to buy milk, formula, fruit and vegetables. Some other places like convenience stores and drug stores will also accept them.

Mum tries to shame commuters who ‘refused to give up their seats’ for her son – but it’s dividing opinion,"A MUM has slammed commuters for refusing to give up their train seats for her young son - but people are divided. Furious Londoner Kelly took to TikTok after her son was left sitting on the floor in the priority seats area of a Southern Rail train. The young boy can be seen squatting in the aisle while adult passengers around him scroll on their phones or laptops. Kelly said: ""All these oblivious people are watching my baby sit on the floor in the priority seats area. ""It's called human decency."" The fuming mum called out London commuters for refusing to surrender their seats to her son. Some people felt sorry for Kelly's son. Samantha said: ""Reminds me of when I was eight months pregnant and had to sit on the floor."" Kayleigh said: ""I would always stand for a child. One of the passengers in the priority seats is just playing Football Manager."" But hundreds of people slammed Kelly. Vaz said: "" My train ticket to London costs £50 - no way would I give my seat to a kid. Declan said: ""Is your child disabled, pregnant or elderly?"" Simon said: ""My mum made me give up my seat to an old woman on a train from London to Carlisle when I was nine. ""I stood for three hours until she got off.""

Nicola Bulley dive expert who feared she’d been abducted dramatically pulls out of search and admits he can’t find her,"THE dive expert scouring the river in the search for Nicola Bulley says his team will end their search later today. Peter Faulding said they have done all they can to find the missing mum-of-two who vanished on January 27. He told reporters this afternoon: “Wherever she is I hope closure comes soon. ""All the family are clearly distraught."" He added he was ""glad"" his team haven't found her. Mr Faulding is the founder of private forensic searchers Specialist Group International (SGI) from Surrey. The team were drafted in on Monday to search the river bed with Sonar but found no trace of the 45-year-old. They had been using £55,000 equipment in their scour on the River Wyre, near St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire. It comes as distraught partner Paul Ansell visited the scene this morning. He spent 10-minutes walking the river bank near the bench where Ms Bulley's phone was found, still connected to a work Teams call. Nicola, a mortgage adviser from nearby Inskip, was last seen walking her dog at around 9.15am on January 27. She had dropped off her daughters, aged six and nine, at school before heading to the towpath near the River Wyre. Monday's search for Nicola focused downstream on the tidal area of the River Wyre but Tuesday's search took place further upstream. It included and went beyond the area where Nicola's belongings were found on a bench near Garstang Road, in St Michael's on Wyre. It is a non-tidal area of the river. Other dive teams started to look further upriver towards Fleetwood and the Irish Sea on Tuesday. Police still believe the mum ""sadly fell"" in the river.

"Lidl worker ‘fleeced wealthy pal, 70, out of £284k then killed her and buried body in “murderous” cover-up’","A ""COLD-blooded"" Lidl worker fleeced his wealthy pal out of £284,000 before killing her then burying her body, a court heard. Serkan Kaygusuz, 42, allegedly formed a three-year ""parasitic"" friendship with Norma Girolami, 70, in a bid to take her money. But after she stopped paying him, he killed Norma in a ""cold-blooded"" plot to steal her fortune and £900,000 house in Highgate, North London, it is said. Jurors were told Kaygusuz buried her body then took control of Norma's electronic devices in a bid to trick her family into believing she was still alive. Prosecutor Jocelyn Ledward said: ""Once such immediate practical matters had been dealt with, rather as he had done when Norma Girolami was alive, he set about systematically taking what remained of the money in her bank accounts. ""He did so by taking over her bank and credit card accounts, setting up online banking on them, something which Norma had never done, ordering replacement cards and then beginning the process of syphoning off Norma's money into his own accounts or withdrawing it in cash."" The Old Bailey was told Kaygusuz took out two loans of £35,000 and £25,000 in Norma's name after her death in August 2021. This was on top of the almost £300,000 she had transferred Kaygusuz during their friendship, jurors heard. The pair had become friends after meeting at a local swimming pool in 2017. Norma was said to have been ""flattered"" after the yoinger man made an ""advance"" in the hot tub at the baths. From early 2018, Norma began sending Kaygusuz ever-increasing amounts of cash, it was said. But in May 2021, the ""money tap which had flowed so freely for so long was switched off"", the court was told. Ms Ledward said: ""For a time, the defendant kept asking for money but Ms Girolami stood firm and kept putting him off. ""By August, the defendant must have realised that his comfortable parasitic lifestyle was not going to continue, he was simply not going to get any more out of Ms Girolami. ""At least, not whilst she was alive."" On August 19, 2021, Norma returned to her lavish home following a day out in Leigh-on-Sea. The court was told Kaygusuz was the last person to have any contact with her with telephone records suggesting he went to her home that night. He allegedly killed her then ""concealed"" her body by burying it. Kaygusuz then took control of Norma's mobile and laptop to pretend to her friends and neighbours she was still alive, it was said. Ms Ledward said: ""He had picked his target with care, Norma was relatively well off, and had a long history with the banks she used, who algorithms did not bat a digital eye-lid at the prospect of significant loans to her. ""For about a month after her disappearance, he succeeded. ""But he misjudged the extent to which Norma's friends and cousins cared about Norma, and how well they knew her. ""They were simply not prepared to accept that she had suddenly cut herself off from everyone and everything she knew. ""It is a testament to them that they were not fooled, that they continued to try and to make contact with Norma, and when puzzlement turned to suspicion and fear, they alerted the police to their very grave concerns for their friend."" The court was told after she was reported missing, Kaygusuz ""quickened his pace"" and made transfers and withdrawals almost every day. This, the prosecution say, was to ""get his hands on as much of Norma's money as quickly as possible"". Kaygusuz has admitted dishonestly obtaining her money and property, and concealing and burying her body but denies murder. The trial continues.

"Putin ‘personally approved’ supply of missile that shot down MH17 killing all 298 on board, say prosecutors","THERE are ""strong indications"" that Vladimir Putin personally approved the supply of the missile that shot down flight MH17 over Ukraine, international investigators say.  Prosecutors revealed evidence suggests the Russian President signed off on the use of the BUK-TELAR missile system.  The Malaysia Airlines jet flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was blown out of the sky on July 17, 2014, killing all 298 passengers and crew members. The mid-air explosion and crash happened during a conflict between pro-Russia rebels and Ukrainian forces. Investigators said there is evidence that warlord Putin decided to give the deadly missile to Moscow-back separatists. However, although prosecutors suggested Putin was behind the missile transfer, the probe into the air disaster is being suspended.  Investigators said ""all leads have been exhausted"", less than three months after three men were sentenced to life in prison for murdering those on board MH17. Russian nationals Igor Girkin, 51, and Sergey Dubinsky, 60, and Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko, 50, were found guilty in absentia by a Dutch court - and were ordered to pay at least £14million in compensation. The Joint Investigation Team of six countries probing the crash announced on Wednesday they have insufficient evidence to launch any new operations.  ""There are strong indications that the Russian president decided on supplying the Buk TELAR to the DPR (Donetsk People's Republic) separatists,"" they said in a statement. The probe uncovered that Russian officials even postponed a decision to send weapons to Ukrainian separatists because Putin was at a D-Day commemoration in France in June 2014. They played an intercepted telephone call from an advisor saying the delay was ""because there is only one who makes a decision, the person who is currently at a summit in France"". Even if Putin could be put in the dock, he benefits from immunity thanks to his role as a tyrannical head of state.  This makes any effort to prosecute the Russian leader impossible, the investigators said. They added that ""although we speak of strong indications, the high bar of complete and conclusive evidence is not reached"" in relation to Putin. The Joint Investigation Team is made up of members from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine.  These were the countries worst affected by the crash of the doomed Boeing 777, as 196 Dutch, 43 Malaysians and 38 Australians were killed in the tragedy. Prosecutors had previously aimed to track down the crew who operated the BUK missile and the chain of command, but they admitted it was not possible for now. The rocket was allegedly brought from a Russian military base in the city of Kursk. Russia dismissed last year's Dutch verdict at the time as ""scandalous"" and politically motivated. Moscow has consistently denied any involvement in the shooting down of MH17. There is no suggestion that Putin ordered the aircraft to be shot down. Judges at the trial last year said the missile had come from Russia and the men were part of a separatist group controlled by Moscow -- but said they had only helped bring it into Ukraine and had not pulled the trigger. In 2019, international investigators released intercepted phone calls showing what they said were links between the rebels and ""high-ranking"" Russian officials, including Vladislav Surkov, a top aide to Putin.

"Andrew Tate’s £5m Bugatti he used to taunt Greta Thunberg & £20m villa in Dubai to be seized by cops, says prosecutors","ANDREW Tate's prized £5million Bugatti supercar and his £20million villa are set to be seized by cops, prosecutors have said. Romanian cops are going after the two pricey assets as they continue to probe Tate - who remains in jail accused with trafficking and rape. Prosecutors want to take control of the Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport and the property on the exclusive artificial island of Palm Jumeirah in Dubai, sources told The Sun Online.  Tate is believed to have purchased both assets in 2022. And the Bugatti is the same one which he used to taunt eco-activist Greta Thunberg. His spat with Thunberg as he shared pictures of himself with a pizza on Twitter came just days before he was arrested.  Romanian police are seizing the assets pending the criminal investigation. And should Tate be convicted, it is believed they will be auctioned off.  Tate's mansion  - which backs onto a golf course and has a view of the city - was reportedly bought in the summer of 2022. It has six bedrooms, a pool, a gym, and a home cinema covered in posters of James Bond.  The villa was widely pictured in a video were Tate flew a hairdresser from Canada to give him a haircut at the mansion. The barber was reportedly paid £8,000.  The luxurious villa would see him being neighbours with figures such as football legend David Beckham and Putin crony Ramzan Kadyrov. Tate's prized Bugatti is one of just 60 such cars in the world, being capable of going from 0 to 60mph in just 2.4 seconds with a top speed of 305mph.  It is regarded as one of the fastest, most expensive and luxurious supercars in the world.  Tate's money and his assets are being chased down by Romanian organised crime-busting cops, DIICOT, as part of the wide-ranging probe.  Some £6million worth of supercars - including a Rolls Royce, Aston Martin and Lamborghini - have already been seized from his compound in Romania. Other assets seized by the cops reportedly include expensive watches and guns.  Andrew and Tristan Tate both deny all allegations against them.  Romania's National Agency for the Management of Seized Assets have now made requests to authorities in Dubai. Misogynistic influencer Tate and his brother Tristan have been arrested accused of sex trafficking and organised crime. He remains detained after his arrest at the end of 2022. The Tates have had all their appeals for release denied as Romanian authorities consider them a flight risk.  Tate built up a sickening image that appealed to teenage boys - creating an online empire that made him one of the most searched people on Google Masquerading as lifestyle advice, much of the content is actually highly sexist and promotes violence against women. His influence has had a worrying spread amongst young men and boys, with one UK MP saying he is ""brainwashing"" children. Tate initially gained fame after a short-lived appearance on Big Brother. He was dumped from the reality show after alleged footage of him beating a woman emerged online. Since then he has sparked revulsion and outrage with a wave of warped content online. Labour MP Alex Davies-Jones called on the UK Government to take action on the spread of Tate's content - with teachers already revealing a worrying spread in schools. ""Schools across the UK are in crisis as the effect of online influencer Andrew Tate’s vile misogyny infiltrates our classrooms and society,"" said Ms Davies Jones MP. ""Teachers are now having to develop their own resources to re-educate boys who are being brainwashed online by his deeply toxic messaging."" Washington DC-born Tate was banned from Twitter in 2017 for violating its terms of service with his controversial comments. In August, Tate was banned from a range of other social media sites - only to then be reinstated on Twitter after the company was taken over by Elon Musk.

President Zelensky hails Boris Johnson for backing Ukraine ‘from the first second’ of Putin’s invasion,"BORIS Johnson was today hailed by President Zelensky for backing Ukraine ""from the first second"" of Putin's evil invasion. The Ukrainian leader singled out the ex-PM as he addressed MPs in Westminster during an historic visit to Britain.  Mr Johnson - one of Zelensky's closest pals on the world stage - smiled as he was praised for standing up to Russia. President Zelensky said: ""From the first seconds and minutes of the full scale war, Great Britain, you extended your helping hand when the world had not yet come to understand how to react. ""Boris, you got others united when it seemed impossible – thank you. ""You showed your strong British character back then You didn’t compromise Ukraine and ideals."" Since leaving Downing Street in September, Mr Johnson has continued to champion Ukraine's independence fight and has even gone back to Kyiv. In recent weeks he has been urging Rishi Sunak to send fighter jets to help beat Putin in the air.  President Zelensky repeated that plea in his hugely moving address today - urging: ""We have freedom, give us the wings to protect it.” In the grand Westminster Hall, Ukraine's hero President was met with a thunderous applause. The war leader said: ""We will always come out on top of evil. This lies at the core of of our, but also your, traditions. ""We know Russia will lose. The victory will change the world and this will be a change that the world has long needed. ""The United Kingdom is marching with us to the most important victory is our lifetime. ""Any aggressor who tries to push the boundaries by force, who tries to inflict destruction and death on other peoples, who try to endure dictatorship at the at the expense of other people's blood in criminal and unprovoked wars... any aggressor is going to lose. ""There must be justice. Anyone who invests in terror must be held accountable. ""Anyone, anyone who invests in violence must compensate those who have suffered from terror.""

Secret upgrade hidden inside millions of iPhones – and it could save you money,"MILLIONS of iPhone models have received a huge upgrade – but it's hidden from sight. Apple quietly redesigned the interior on iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, but you'd never be able to tell from the outside. It's only once the case is opened up that you can see some of the magic. Apple says that the new innards allow the device to dissipate heat better, helping to keep the handset cool for maximum performance. But it also means the iPhone is much easier (and therefore cheaper) to repair. To understand how the changes work, you need to go all the way back to the iPhone 5. When the iPhone 5 came out, Apple used a single-enclosure ""bucket"" design. This is still true even with 2021's iPhone 13. So if you want to repair a component inside the iPhone, you need to remove the display module – and potentially other pieces too, if the broken part is closer to the back glass. With the iPhone 14, the back glass is separate from the aluminium enclosure. And the interior has completely changed. If you remove the display, you'll find a central structural frame that serves as an internal ""backbone"". For a start, this helps to dissipate heat – so the iPhone processor can offer better performance while staying cool. If you flip the iPhone over and remove the back glass, you can now access most of the components. Ultimately, the new central ""frame"" that replaces the bucket means that key parts of the iPhone can be accessed from either side. Apple says the brand new design means that the iPhone can be lighter than the previous year's model, 15% more powerful, and far more repairable. The last bit is important, because it means that Apple will charge you far less for some repairs. Apple doesn't have to remove the display module for every repair, for instance. In the US, for instance, back glass repairs are far cheaper – because it can be individually repaired. So an out-of-warranty repair has been discounted from $449 on iPhone 13 to just $169 on iPhone 14. And for Brits, the same repair drops from £369 to £169. That means it's far cheaper to hold on to your iPhone for longer – allowing you to potentially avoid a costly upgrade. The only catch is that the new internal redesign is only built into the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. That means owners of the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max still have the more traditional ""bucket"" design. But it's entirely possible that Apple will switch more future models to the new interior, bringing repair savings to even more iPhone fans. Looking for tips and hacks for your phone?

Turkey earthquake: How to donate,"TURKEY and Syria were hit by a huge earthquake on February 6, 2023 that has left thousands dead. The disaster has left potentially millions without homes and in need of support. Here's some information about what happened and how you can help. We launched The Sun Earthquake Appeal on February 6, 2023 in response to the devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. All money raised will be donated to the British Red Cross for a major on-the-ground mobilisation. Red Crescent staff are already distributing essentials such as food, water, blankets and temporary shelters to support survivors who spent the night outside in freezing temperatures. Support is also being provided for traumatised people. To donate, visit redcross.org.uk/sunaid. In the early hours of February 6, 2023, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit near the town of Gaziantep, and was followed by numerous aftershocks. It hit around 150 miles away from the Turkey-Syria border, with devastation on both sides. Hours later, a 7.5 magnitude quake hit more than 60 miles away. Scores of violent aftershocks followed both quakes and continued into Tuesday. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the earthquake, and death toll is expected to keep rising.  It is already one of the deadliest earthquakes this century. The 7.8 quake was triggered by two faults moving laterally against each other, or a strike slip.  A tremor of 2.5 or less usually cannot be felt, but can be detected by instruments.  Quakes of up to five are felt and cause minor damage.  The Turkish earthquake at 7.8 is classified as major and usually causes serious damage, as it has in this instance. An earthquakes is the result of sudden movement along a fault – a crack -within the Earth's crust.  The movement releases stored-up energy in the form of seismic waves, which spread through the Earth and cause the ground surface to shake, according to the British Geological Survey. In this case it was the Arabian plate moving northwards and grinding against the Anatolian plate. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21316695/turkey-earthquake-how-donate/
Which New Look stores are closing down in the UK?,"BRITISH fashion retailer New Look announced that several stores will close forever in 2023. The high street chain last closed 85 of its shops and laid off hundreds of staff back in 2018. Find out if your nearest store is closing down this year - and why so many closed permanently recently...
 The retailer has closed five stores this year and plans to shut another two forever. The following stores have already closed: New Look will close its Grosvenor Centre store in Northampton on February 15 and its Kirkcaldy store by the end of the month. But in November 2022 New Look opened several shops across the UK. It also has plans to open more stores later on in the year - though it hasn't said how many and where in the UK they'll be. In 2018, New Look sought approval from creditors to cut 1,600 staff and close more than 85 stores after it performed poorly and struggled to pay back loans. In a statement, the company earmarked 60 out of its 593 stores for closure, as well as a further six sites which are sub-let to third parties. The Company Voluntary Arrangement proposal also included a reduction in rental costs and revised lease terms across 393 stores. As a result, up to 980 of its 15,300 UK staff were made redundant. And later on in 2018, a further 25 stores were announced to be closing. The retailer also closed all 148 of its stores in China. New Look closed its stores in the following locations: New Look was founded by Tom Singh in Taunton, Somerset, in 1969. Prior to the closures, it now has more than over 900 stores internationally, including in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Republic of Ireland and Romania. It has expanded into Asia, with outlets in Malaysia, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, United Arab Emirates and China. The group had a turnover of £1.1billion in 2008, with profits of £180 million. New Look was acquired by South African organisation Brait SE, which also owns the health club chain Virgin Active, for £780 million in May 2015. Brait SE is a South African investment heavyweight in which tycoon Christo Wiese owns about a third of its stock. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/5748350/new-look-stores-closing-down-uk-latest/

Eamon O’Hearn, GMB national officer, previously said: ""The proposal to close DWP sites will not only cost jobs but will undermine Government rhetoric about growing the labour force.  ""Closures will undoubtedly impact on services and represent a screeching U-turn on the original programme to extend the reach of DWP into communities.  ""GMB members, who work as security at these sites, will have their jobs and futures put at risk.  But the closures only affect Jobcentres which were set up temporarily during the pandemic to help ensure social distancing guidelines were followed. The DWP has said that the decommissioning of these additional temporary sites, where they are no longer required, will not reduce our levels of service or access to face-to-face appointments going forward.  A DWP spokesperson said: ""To continue providing our essential employment support and other services in a way that is cost-efficient for the taxpayer, we are phasing out these temporarily leased sites and staff and all customer services will return to the nearby established jobcentre. ""The closing of these temporary sites will not reduce our levels of service, or access to face-to-face appointments. ""Customers will return to being served by their established Jobcentre and there will be no reduction in the number of Work Coaches serving customers as a result."" These temporary Jobcentres will close within weeks and all are expected to shut by the end of March. Here's a full list of the Jobcentres set to close their doors forever: The DWP already operates 639 permanent Jobcentres filled with work coaches to help and support those claiming legacy benefits and Universal Credit. Last year, the DWP announced the closure of 10 ""poorer quality"" Jobcentres and many were merged to help offer customers a better level of service. Jobcentres are there to assist those on Universal Credit to find and get back into work.  When you apply for Universal Credit online, you will need to visit your local Jobcentre where you'll be assigned a work coach and a dedicated central case manager. All the advice and help provided is free of charge and the work coach helps customers look for work that is most suited to their skills.

Nicola Bulley sleuths are convinced mystery drink bottle could hold answers to her disappearance,"SLEUTHS investigating Nicola Bulley's disappearance claim a drinks bottle could hold vital clues to her whereabouts. Doorbell camera footage of the mum-of-two leaving her home the day she vanished shows her clutching what looks like a bottle of water. The 45-year-old, from Inskip, Lancashire, is seen wearing a long dark coat, leggings and ankle boots with her hair tied in a ponytail. She then hops into her Mercedes 4x4 before taking off on the school run to drop off her two daughters the morning of January 27. The mum left her motor in the car park of her daughters' school in St Michael's on Wyre, before heading off for a walk. A friend of Nicola released the CCTV footage in a bid to find her. But stills from the footage have been pulled into question by amateur detectives on Facebook who question where the bottle ended up. A member of 14k-strong Help find Nicola Bulley said: ""I saw on the CCTV footage of Nicola holding a drinks bottle.  ""Was that bottle left in the car or did she take it on the walk with her."" They went on to ponder whether the bottle may have ended up in a bin somewhere, perhaps offering a clue to where Nicola went. They alleged it could hold her ""DNA"" on it - this claim is unsubstantiated. But another armchair detective suggested the bottle could be for one of her kids for school. While another queried: ""I wondered if the water was for the dog."" Lancashire Police has not commented on the bottle or its whereabouts. The Sun Online have approached the force for comment on the bottle. It is unclear if the bottle was ever even taken with Nicola on the walk, and it may have stayed in the car. It is unclear if cops have searched bins in the surrounding area, but they insist they have carried out ""thorough"" investigations. On Wednesday, Peter Faulding, said his team have done all they can to try and find Nicola as he called off the search. Discussing search progress, the dive leader said there is simply ""no sign"" of Nicola near to where she vanished around St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire. Mr Faulding is the founder of private forensic searchers Specialist Group International (SGI) from Surrey. The team were drafted in on Monday to assist police divers in to search the river bed with Sonar. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21319240/nicola-bulley-news-water-bottle-theory/
England’s top 50 WORST places to live revealed – and there’s a new town in the top spot… where does yours rank?,"THE worst places to live in the UK have been revealed in a new poll of unhappy residents. The survey by ILiveHere found Luton to be bottom of the heap in terms of quality of life for locals - now you can see where your town ranks. Peterborough came in second, closely followed by the nation's most densely populated city, Portsmouth, despite its picturesque harbour Slough and Aylesbury rounded out the top five, based on audience surveys and public votes. The YouTube clip revealing the top ten undesirable locations attracted scathing comments about the places featured. One user wrote: ""I left Luton in 2020 and I'm glad."" Another blasted: ""As Luton recently lost Chicken George [a local restaurant] as its only saving grace, it shall forever remain at number one."" A third fumed on Facebook: ""Luton...if you live there, you are already living in hell."" However, one defended the hated town, saying: ""There are far far worse places than Luton in the UK, lets not kid ourselves."" Lovers of Northampton might feel stung as it only just snuck onto the list in 50th place. London boroughs seem to have avoided the wrath of the public as only four appear on the list. Hounslow, Barking and Dagenham and Croydon are all on there, though none higher than 19th. Perhaps surprisingly, Kensington and Chelsea comes out worst in the capital, in 15th, despite being home to streets of luxury shops and restaurants catering to millionaire residents. The North and Midlands bore the brunt of local dissatisfaction, with the majority of the top 50 in those regions. However, southern regions including London, Essex, Dorset and Buckinghamshire all saw areas make the list. Some social media commenters, though, were less generous than the official rankings, suggesting that ""all of England"" should be placed in the top spot. 1. Luton 2. Peterborough 3. Portsmouth 4.

"Boeing 787 Dreamliner moments from crashing into sea after plunging 1,000ft in 24 seconds in horror near-disaster","PASSENGERS have been left reeling after discovering one of the world's top airlines nearly crashed a plane moments after take off. Qatar Airways has launched an internal investigation after a harrowing incident in January nearly resulted in a plane crashing into the ocean. It's been revealed that a Qatar Airways 787 Boeing Dreamliner came within seconds of hitting the waters of the Persian Gulf. The flight took off from Hamad International Airport on January 10 at 2am, bound for Denmark. But recent reports have revealed the first officer in control of the plane lost 1000 feet in elevation within 24 seconds - for no obvious reason. The first officer was reportedly flying manually without directions from the automated ""flight director"". The captain quickly took charge and pulled the aircraft up 800 feet, avoiding disaster.  The first pilot suffered from ""lost situational awareness"", resulting in a quick descent which ""exceeded the flap speed limit"" The aircraft continued its journey to Copenhagen after the terrifying instance. Qatar Airways told MailOnline that the incident was reported to the authorities immediately, and the popular airline released a statement. They said: ""Qatar Airways is aware of an event relating to flight QR161 operating Doha to Copenhagen on January 10, 2023. It was immediately reported to authorities and an internal investigation is being carried out. ""The airline follows the most stringent standards of safety, training and reporting and is working to address any findings in line with industry norms."" The incident has sparked outrage and fear among pilots and passengers alike online. The online forum Aviation Herald has been flooded with comments on the incident, with many concerned about the qualifications of the first pilot who allowed the craft to nosedive. One user said: ""I can’t believe this actually was allowed to happen. This was mere seconds from a complete hull loss. Inexcusable."" Others attributed the incident to Qatar Airline's busy schedules it has in place for its pilots. They said: ""I see many comments jumping directly into fast conclusions about the pilots. ""Qatar Airways have their pilots completely fatigued due to illegal usage of FTL. I've seen rosters up to 158 block hours."" Another simply said: ""In my humble opinion, this should not happen to an IFR rated pilot, private or commercial."" A report in 2021 revealed that Boeing Dreamliners are among the world's safest planes in terms of accidents. There have been no fatalities or events involving extensive damage during more than a decade of flights using the model.

Inside terrifying WW1-style trench warfare training as Brit troops prepare for battle on Putin’s doorstep in -12C freeze,"NATO troops have taken part in terrifying World War I-style trench drills as they stand braced for war with tyrant Putin.  The chilling war games took place just 80 miles from the Russian border in -12C temperatures using the world's most lethal tanks and high-tech weapons.  Nato's snow-covered Winter Camp in Estonia was the backdrop for the exercise with Britain, France, Denmark, the US and Estonian troops all taking part.  The Sun has been given first-hand access to the drills as our soldiers stand alongside their comrades from across Europe while international tensions run high.  This year, the annual exercises are held in the shadow of the one-year anniversary of Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Our Sun reporter was alongside our boys as they face the blistering cold just a stone's throw from the doorstep of Mad Vlad. In one striking exercise, the Estonian forces, playing enemy combatants, have to defend a series of trenches carved into the ground of the Central Training Area military base, around an hour's drive east of Estonia's capital Tallinn. The Estonian troops aim their Browning machine gun and R20 RAHE assault rifles at a line of trees some 30 feet from their trenches.  Dramatic pictures show them ""open fire"" on the approaching French troops, who are the Nato contingent in the exercise. Although firing blanks, the sound rattles through half a mile of crisscrossing trenches - their walls supported by huge tree trunks.  Footage shows French troops storming through the bunkers, taking out Estonian troops one by one who 'play dead' in the attack.  War 'casualties' are dragged unceremoniously through the snow and mud-filled trench - similar to brutal scenes from the First World War.  Two Danish-driven Leopard 2 A7 tanks, which one soldier describes as ""the most lethal tank in Europe,"" were also unleashed in the terrifying war games.  The menacing war machines are currently making their way into Ukraine after Germany kept its promise to deliver them to the frontline.  As Nato rallied its troops for drills in frosty Estonia, Russia suffered its deadliest day on the battlefield - losing 1,000 troops in just 24 hours.  The blood of Putin's men was reportedly spilt before they had even advanced 30ft as they staged another winter assault in the east. The humiliating defeat will only bolster Ukrainian and Nato troops as the alliance carry out its show of strength near Putin's border. Temperatures at the base have plummeted to chilly -12C, presenting a whole new series of challenges for Nato's forces.  One Estonian soldier explains to The Sun that in the spring when the ground softens, they would be able to dig a trench such as this in just 24 hours. But in the icy cold, with the ground frozen solid, they have to use pick axes to carve into the earth. The camp is around an hour and a half drive from the Estonian capital Tallinn, through snow-covered fields dotted with farmhouses and Soviet-era apartment blocks. Dense forests of fir trees provide perfect cover for camouflaged tanks and military vehicles, on the vast military base, about the size of 15,000 football pitches. Along with other Nato forces, including the native Estonian army, the Brits have been building up for huge war games featuring heavy armour, helicopters, and rocket launchers. One British tank driver, a Lance Corporal in the King's Royal Hussars tank regiment, said the exercises demonstrate the closeness of the Nato forces. ""We can see that our Estonian counterparts are worried about what's going on with Russia. But they feel we're here to help. ""We have a close bond as part of Nato now. Nato is one team, and the Estonians have got on board with that. ""They've opened their arms to us, and they're learning from us. ""If anything was to happen in the future, we'd be ready for anything."" Many of the soldiers have been here in the tiny Baltic nation bordering Russia for the past five months, conducting training drills and improving their battle readiness. All of their hard work will pay off as they take part in Nato's enhanced Forward Presence Battlegroup. The training, which for many of the soldiers in Keskpolügoon started back in September, hasn't been without its challenges. The British contingent has been quickly learning how to fight in the unforgiving cold of Estonia. The Brit tank driver added: ""Learning to operate and fight, as well as live, in this environment, is our biggest challenge."" ""We can take the skills and drills we have learned here and take them back to the UK, or wherever we operate,"" ""We can adapt them to any battlefield."" One of his French counterparts, Julien, a lieutenant who commands a 30-person platoon, agreed. He said: ""It is important for the Estonians to see all of us from Nato here. It allows us to reassure them. To show them that Nato and the West are with them. ""They have a possible enemy nearby,"" he added. ""They are aware they are in a risky situation."" A corporal in the British army, who works as a signaller, took The Sun through the battle crew. In a basecamp built among the frosted woods, a Bulldog FV432 armoured personnel carrier, a Panther protected patrol vehicle, and a Danish Piranha tank hulk over the surrounding soldiers. But when the brave troops miss home, the corporal said they can go into the Bulldog and make a cup of tea. The Danish and Estonian soldiers may be more used to the cold than their British counterparts, but that doesn't mean that they aren't learning from the UK. Rasmus, a deputy commander in the Danish army, explained that the Brits and Danes have been cooperating in these types of missions as far back as the 1990s during the wars in the Balkans. Denmark was able to demonstrate its new state-of-the-art German-built Leopard 2 tanks. Received two years ago, these exercises mark the first time they have been deployed outside of Denmark.

Your iPhone has a hidden number that reveals when it’s time to get an upgrade,"EVERY iPhone features a hidden number that reveals when it's time to upgrade. It's worth checking it every so often to see how your gadget is faring. When you buy a new iPhone, it will have very good battery life. But over time, the maximum capacity of the battery decreases. Eventually, a battery can perform so poorly that you may struggle to even make it through a day between charges. Thankfully it's very easy to check exactly how much capacity your iPhone battery has left. When you buy a new iPhone, it's considered to have a 100% battery. And this percentage will reduce as you deplete and recharge the device. So after 500 charging ""cycles"" – or about two years – you'd expect to be on around 80%. That means you're getting 20% less life out of a full iPhone charge compared to when it was new. Go into Settings > Battery > Battery Health & Charging. Then look under Maximum Capacity to see what your battery performance percentage is. This is a measure of battery capacity relative to when it was new,"" Apple explains. ""Lower capacity may result in fewer hours of usage between charges."" If you're below 80%, you might find it very annoying. One option is to simply upgrade your iPhone. If the battery capacity is low then you've probably had it for a few years, so upgrading isn't a bad idea. But a far cheaper option is to simply buy an iPhone battery replacement from Apple. This means you'll have ""like new"" battery life without forking out for a brand new model. The price of an iPhone battery replacement can vary depending on your model. The Apple website has a calculator that explains how much you'll have to pay for each model. You can find it here. ""Use our 'Get an Estimate' tool to review potential costs,"" Apple explains. It's a good time to do it, given that the price of an iPhone battery swap is about to rise. From March 1, an iPhone battery swap will cost £20 more in the UK and an extra $20 in the US for millions of handsets. Replacing an iPhone 13, iPhone 12, iPhone 11 or iPhone X battery will set you back £89 / $89 after March 1. Looking for tips and hacks for your phone?

Shock iPhone 15 ‘Ultra’ images reveal what new Apple handset will probably look like,"TIDES may be changing at Apple, where its newest iPhone 15 could be better designed for water. Rumoured new features suggest the tech company is tossing out a decades worth of fashion focus to build the ultimate adventure phone. ⚪️🟠 pic.twitter.com/7vRuVU1lDy A shift towards older, more durable technology among the younger generation in recent months may have prompted a significant change of design purpose at Apple.  Rumours suggest the iPhone 15, set to be unveiled officially in September, may be portless and instead rely on wireless charging.  This would make it a powerhouse model for underwater use, considering it will almost certainly be waterproof like Apple's more recent models.  Onlookers are also anticipating an upgrade to the satellite messaging system that has been patented, making it a glossy handset built for adventure.  Apple is currently using satellite connection for the Emergency SOS feature. Designer Jonas Daehnert used the blueprint of the Apple Watch Ultra - which was given a rugged design for its active use, as a basis for what he believes the newest iPhone to look like.  Daehnert has grown popular in the tech space for his smartphone predictions.  Some tech fans have previously reported that the iPhone 15 may feature the first 3nm processor in Apple's range, T3 reported. This could boost the smartphone's performance by as much as 15%, according to TSMC, the company which makes the processors.  Others have alluded to the device having a titanium frame, an incredibly strong but lightweight metal that will increase the handsets durability.  While it all sounds good, Apple is likely to be keeping a few tricks up its sleeves ahead of the launch later this year.  Looking for tips and hacks for your phone?

New development after tragic four-year-old girl mauled to death by devil dog – as cops say breed WASN’T banned,"THE devil dog which mauled a four-year-old girl to death wasn't a banned breed, says cops. Alice Stones was killed by the family pet in the back garden of her Milton Keynes home last week. Thames Valley Police have today said the breed of dog, which the family had owned for only a few weeks, was allowed in the UK. A spokesperson for the force said: ""Following the fatal dog attack in Netherfield, Milton Keynes last Tuesday, we can confirm that formal identification has now taken place. ""The four-year-old girl has been identified as Alice Stones. ""There has also been a large amount of speculation around the breed of the dog.  ""Although we are not in a position to confirm the exact breed of the dog due to the requirement for further testing, we are able to confirm that the dog is not a banned breed."" The dog was put down after armed officers were called to the scene. Police remained outside the house today as the street was covered in flowers and notes. Locals on the housing estate recalled hearing an ""excitable dog"" which growled and barked around the time of the attack.

Nicola Bulley timeline: Full list of events and clues so far from phone to diver search,"NICOLA Bulley vanished while walking her dog on January 27 leaving her family in agony as they search for answers. Despite a mammoth police hunt, there has been no trace of the missing mum-of-two. Officers believe Nicola, 45, fell into a river as she walked springer spaniel Willow in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire. Specialist divers have now pulled out of the search after saying they did all they could to find the mortgage broker. Police will continue their efforts to find Nicola as the mystery surrounding the case deepens. Here's how Nicola's disappearance unfolded. Nicola began her walk along the towpath to the River Wyre at 8.43am after dropping her two children off at school. Police say around seven minutes later, a dog walker who knows Nicola saw her walking around the lower field with her springer spaniel Willow. The witness said their two dogs interacted briefly before she left Nicola via the river path. At 8.53am, the mum sent an email to her boss at Exclusively Mortgages. She then logged into a Teams call at 9.01am and was seen around nine minutes later on the upper field walking Willow. Police say at 9.30am, the work call ended but Nicola stayed logged on. At around 9.35am, the mobile and Willow were found at a bench by the river but there was no sign of Nicola. She was reported missing and Lancashire Police launched a probe. Drones, helicopters and police search dogs are deployed as part of the huge missing person's operation. Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service, Bowland Pennine mountain rescue team and the North West underwater search team also lend their services. Despite the massive search, there is still no trace of Nicola. Volunteers meet in the village hall to organise a search for Nicola. Around 100 locals help out as police urge them to exercise caution. Officers describe the river as “extremely dangerous”. Superintendent Sally Riley says police are “keeping a really open mind about what could have happened”. They confirm Nicola's disappearance is not being treated as suspicious. Nicola's partner of 12 years said her daughters, nine and six, were desperate for their mum to come home. Speaking at the family home in Inskip, Paul Ansell said: ""It is just perpetual hell. Utter disbelief. ""All we can say is we need to find her. She's got two little girls that need their mummy home. ""We have got to get some good news now."" Police speak to a potential witness seen walking a small white fluffy dog near the River Wyre when Nicola vanished. Her family released a statement saying they had been “overwhelmed by the support” in their community. They also said Nicola's daughters were “desperate to have their mummy back home safe”. Nicola's parents Ernest and Dot talk about their fears somebody has ""got her"". Ernest said the family ""dread to think"" they will never see Nicola again as he does not how they would deal with that ""for the rest of our lives"". Speaking about her daughter's children, he added: ""We don't know how long we can keep going before they realise, they think mummy is coming home soon, but if this keeps going on and on I don't know where we are going to go or what to say to them."" A second witness is identified by police. Police urged the woman dressed in a red coat to get in touch before later questioning her. Nicola's family wept as they issued a heartfelt plea for information. Sister Louise Cunningham told Sky News: ""If I'm being honest, it feels like I'm just stuck in a nightmare. ""We're going round and round in circles trying to piece together what could have possibly happened. ""It's like she's just vanished into thin air. We just want her home, we need her home, her children need her home. It's absolutely heartbreaking."" Lancashire Police holds a press conference and confirms their “main working hypothesis” is that Nicola had “sadly fallen in the river”. Supt Sally Riley said there may have been an ""issue"" with dog Willow that led Nicola to the edge of the water. The officer also confirmed there is a ten-minute window where they cannot account for Nicola's movements. This is between 9.10am - the last confirmed sighting - and 9.20am when Nicola's phone is believed to have been on a bench while connected to a work call. She also gave a list of clothing Nicola was last seen wearing - including an ankle-length black quilted gilet jacket. Nicola had a a black Engelbert Strauss waist-length coat underneath the gilet and was wearing black tight-fitting jeans. She had long green walking socks tucked into her jeans, ankle-length green Next wellies, a necklace and a pale blue Fitbit on. Nicola's sister says there is ""no evidence"" behind the police theory that the missing mum plunged into the river. Louise wrote: ""Off the back of the latest police media update, please can I add there is no evidence whatsoever that she has gone into the river, it's just a theory. ""Everyone needs to keep an open mind as not all CCTV and leads have been investigated fully, the police confirmed the case is far from over."" Emma White, a friend of Nicola's, also rejected the police's theory. Lancashire Police speak to another witness - a woman seen pushing a pram near where Nicola vanished. CCTV is released by Nicola's loved ones showing the mum on the day she vanished. Snaps from Nicola's own Ring Doorbell show her loading her car outside her home just hours before she went missing. Specialist Group International (SGI) begin their search of the river using sonar equipment. The team is led by expert in forensics Peter Faulding and offered their services free of charge. He later claims Nicola's phone found by the river is a ""decoy"". Mr Faulding also suggests a third party could be involved. Police say they have probed ""every criminal element"" as they remain ""fully open minded"" over her disappearance. Supt Sally Riley said the force has not yet detected a ""suspicious"" element in Nicola's disappearance. She added: ""Every third party element or criminal element has been looked into and discounted."" The officer also warned amateur detectives from trespassing in empty properties. And she hit out at dive expert Peter, saying: ""Clearly Mr Faulding isn’t included within all the investigation detail any more than the members of the public are that I’m briefing through these sorts of press conferences.” It came after he told multiple news outlets he believed Nicola is not in the River Wyre and even asked her partner is she had any ""enemies"" after fearing she had been abducted. The dive team dramatically called their search off - saying they had done all they can. He told reporters: “Wherever she is I hope closure comes soon. ""All the family are clearly distraught."" Discussing search progress, the dive leader said there is simply ""no sign"" of Nicola near to where she vanished. He explained: ""We've cleared completely the area where the bench is and about a mile up from the bench, where the phone was initially found. ""We've run the side scan sonar from here down to the next bridge, which is about three or four miles away and there is no sign of Nicola in that particular area. ""We've done very thorough searches all the way down to the weir. I'm totally baffled by this one, to be honest.” And he admitted he was ""glad"" his team haven't found her.

Wetherspoons staff sell their old kit on eBay as branches close – including a bizarre kitchen appliance,"WETHERSPOONS staff are selling their old kit on eBay as branches close - including a bizarre kitchen appliance. It comes as the popular pub chain have confirmed that more boozers will be shutting their doors for good this year, And it's seen former Wetherspoons workers flogging their old uniforms as well as other items on eBay. A 30th anniversary Real Ale Festival shirt - worn by 'spoons staff to promote the event - is being sold for £15 on the popular online auction site. While a one litre bottle of the pub chain’s now discontinued Chipotle mayo is currently on offer for £12.35. The best before date - showing it went off in March 2021 - is also pictured. It is being sold on the site as: “A brand-new, unused, unopened and undamaged item.” Bizarrely some eBayers are even selling the pub’s menus too. On a Facebook discussion about the sales, staff reacted in hysterics to the opportunist sellers. Others offered £25 for their favourite sauce and another proclaimed: “I would literally bid a grand on this.” On top of the £12.35 price a buyer would have to pay £4.65 for delivery and the seller will not take returns. They claim the best before date means it is still edible, but it must be refrigerated once opened. One current employee laughed “Let’s profit on this s**t”. And another raged that it was: “The best sauce ‘Spoons ever made until they ruined it.” Other Wetherspoon memorabilia on the bidding site include tape measures designed especially to measure Wetherspoons’ chips. While customers keen to emulate the ‘Spoons fashion can even buy t-shirts advertising their Chargrilled chicken for £6. But the price drops to £5.28 each if punters want to scoop three shirts. And one seller is even touting their work lanyard for  a cut-price £1.99. Other real-ale festival shirts by the company are some of the priciest options, including one from 2019 for £10 and another for £9. A cider festival shirt advertising up to 16 options is also up for grabs for £15. There are also menus from different locations on sale “for collectors”. Wetherspoons declined to comment. Last month, the pub chain confirmed that a further eight pubs have been sold, on top of the three that The Sun previously reported. At least two of the pubs have already shut up shop this new year, including one in Lewisham and one in Worcester. The popular chain has also confirmed 35 pubs are still on the market. They will remain open and trading under the Wetherspoon brand until they are sold. Pubs have been knocked by a cocktail of cost increases as inflation sends prices soaring and less demand among cash-strapped punters. The pub chain saw like-for-like sales drop 1.1% in the five weeks to November 6, 2022 when compared with pre-pandemic trading in 2019.

Archie Battersbee sent heartbreaking texts to mum before dying – as inquest says he didn’t deliberately take own life,"ARCHIE Battersbee sent heartbreaking messages to his mum about being depressed before he was found collapsed, an inquest heard. The 12-year-old died on August 6 when his life support was withdrawn despite a landmark legal battle to keep him alive. Mum Hollie Dance had discovered him unconscious at home in Essex on April 7. A coroner today ruled Archie died due to an ""accident"" and ""did not intend to take his own life"". He also concluded there was no evidence the schoolboy was taking part in an online challenge like previously believed. The hearing was told how Archie had messaged Hollie in the months before the horror about his mood. In one, the schoolboy told her he was “so depressed at the moment”. Archie sent another text where he referenced wanting to “give up on everything”. The inquest was also told the schoolboy had received a voice note on his phone dated April 3. In the audio, a young male voice could be heard saying: ""Oi Archie, do you know why you're angry? ""Because your mum wanted you to be an abortion."" Detective Sergeant Tiffany Gore said another voice note from the same date was also found. The court there was a ""heated exchange"" on February 15 with a ""number of voice notes"". Essex's senior coroner Lincoln Brookes said: ""One could characterise it as a heated exchange of bravado where each are threatening and saying they know someone who could harm (the other)."" His mum previously said he may have been taking part in a viral challenge at the time he was found unresponsive. But in her evidence, Hollie said she cannot be sure of her original claims and believes Archie died by ""accident"". Asked how she thinks her son died, she replied: ""I think he climbed on the banister and probably fell, causing serious injury to his neck, resulting in unconsciousness."" The hearing was told police recovered 695 images and 282 videos from Archie's phone. None of these contained evidence of Archie taking part in any online challenges. But the officer said Archie had TikTok and she ""can't say with absolute certainty that Archie didn't see an online challenge"" or something containing ""suicidal thoughts"". The inquest was told that although there was evidence he had been in a ""low mood"" previously, Archie was ""very much looking forward"" before his death. His headteacher at Earls Hall Primary School, Matthew Badcock, said: ""My gut reaction is that Archie was not trying to kill himself. ""He adored his mum and I can’t believe he would do anything like that to upset her.” The inquest also heard from family members, who described the teen as a ""joker"". His older half brother Thomas Summers said on the day Archie collapsed, the teen had called to ask where he had got a coat from. He added: ""I do not believe Archie would have intentionally harmed himself in any way when just a few hours before he was looking to buy a coat."" Hollie yesterday revealed the harrowing moments after she discovered Archie unresponsive in his room. She told the hearing she ran outside ""screaming"" as an ambulance was scrambled to the family home. Hollie added: ""I was asked to sit on the stairs. I was crying hysterically ""I was saying ‘please don’t leave mummy, I love you little man’. ""I repeated that over and over again, I just didn’t want him to leave me. Everything seemed in slow motion.” Archie's parents launched a mammoth legal battle to keep their son alive after he was found unconscious. But they lost their fight at every hurdle, with judges ruling that keeping his life support switched on was not in the youngster's ""best interests"". In his ruling, the coroner said Archie was like ""many 12-year-olds” who go through “lows and highs”. He said the “happy go lucky” and “cheeky chappy” his mum portrayed him as was the same Archie she saw on April 7. The coroner added: ""He had plans later that day and big plans for his first MMA fight and it was a very big deal for him and he was looking forward to and training for.  ""Am I satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he intended [to take is own life] - the answer is no.” “It’s my view that this was an accident”. He also paid tribute to Archie and said his death would ""clearly leave a huge hole"" in people's lives. The coroner said to his family: ""You have given me an insight into this young man, what he had achieved and what he looked like he would achieve.  ""You are quite right to be proud of this young man.""

Martin Lewis issues urgent warning for anyone waiting for cheap mortgage rates to return,"MARTIN Lewis has issued an urgent warning for anyone waiting for cheap mortgage rates to return. The consumer champion said on the latest episode of the Martin Lewis Money Show that people shouldn't delay taking out a new mortgage deal. The founder of MoneySavingExpert said: ""I've been quite concerned over recent months of many people who have got in touch with me in recent months who said I'll stick on the standard variable until rates go back to the cheap rates that we had."" ""I need to be very plain. If you're under 35 you might not realise that the rates we had from 2008 until last year, they were low. ""They were limbo-ing well below the prior 300-year historic lows for interest rates. ""We have lived through an anomaly time so there is absolutely no rule that says things must go back to how they were. I'm not saying they won't, but there is no rule that it must."" The average two-year fixed-rate in December 2021 was 2.34%, but by December 2022 it reached 5.84%. But Martin's advice comes after mortgage rates fell below 4% for the first time in five months this week. HSBC announced that it is offering those remortgaging a five-year fixed deal at 3.99% to 60% LTV with a £999 fee. And Lloyds Bank and Virgin Money slashed their 10-year mortgage deals to 3.99%. But keep in mind that the exact mortgage rate you can get depends on your personal financial circumstances. This is good news for home buyers and mortgage holders looking to refinance. And Martin warned that those looking to buy or remortgage shouldn't speculate that rates will fall back to levels seen in 2021. Lenders have been cutting rates even though the Bank of England hiked its base rate for the tenth time in a row to 4% in January in a bid to tackle inflation. It now expects it to peak at 4.5% before falling to 3.25% over the next three years. The base rate is used by lenders to price the rates offered to customers on savings and loans including mortgages. Usually, a rise in the base rate is passed on to consumers, but banks are dropping interest rates instead. This is because the Bank of England has lowered its forecasts on how interest rates will peak from 6% to 4.5% since the disastrous mini-Budget which caused mortgage rates to shoot up to a 14-year high. Borrowers on fixed-rate mortgages have been cushioned from the immediate impact of rising rates so far. But those coming off a cheap fix will still face a hike to their monthly payments. If you have a fixed rate, you could see higher rates when you come to the end of the current term. Around 2.2million borrowers are due to come to the end of a deal that they fixed when the base rate was at a historic low of 0.1%. But if you're nearing the end of a fixed deal soon, you may be wondering if it's worth looking for another one now. David Hollingworth of broker L&C Mortgages previously told The Sun: ""Although those coming to the end of a fixed rate taken during the low in rates of recent years, will still be faced with higher payments than they have been used to, it’s a far cry from the prospect of rates at 6% or more. ""Those borrowers that understandably decided to sit on their hands when rates went through the roof last October, should now seriously consider if it’s time to take advantage of these significant improvements."" Getting the best rate on your mortgage can depend on the rates available at the time, but there are several ways to land the best deal. Usually the larger the deposit you have the lower the rate you can get. If you're remortgaging and your loan-to-value ratio has changed this could also give you access to better rates than before. A change to your credit score or a better salary could also help you access better rates. If you have a fixed rate, you could see higher rates when you come to the end of the current term after the BoE rise, either when shopping for a new fixed deal or reverting to the standard variable rate (SVR). But if you're nearing the end of a fixed deal soon it's worth looking now.  You can lock in current deals sometimes up to six months before your current deal ends. Fixed rates have historically been cheaper than SVRs, but that may not be the case now, so its worth comparing the costs, and how long you want to be locked in for. Leaving a fixed deal early will usually come with an early exit fee, so you want to avoid this extra cost. But depending on the cost and how much you could save by switching versus sticking, it could be worth paying to leave the deal - but compare the costs first. To find the best deal use a mortgage comparison tool to see what's available. You can also got to a mortgage broker who can compare for you, but you may have to pay for this service. It could cost a couple of hundred pounds but it might save you thousands on you mortgage overall. You'll also need to factor in fees for the mortgage, though some have no fees at all, or you can add it on to the cost of the mortgage, but beware that means you'll pay interest on it and so will cost more in the long term. You can use a mortgage calculator to see how much you could borrow. Remember, that you'll have to pass the lender's strict eligibility criteria too, which will include affordability checks, and looking at your credit file. You may also need to provide documents such as utility bills, proof of benefits, your last three month's payslips, passports and bank statement.

‘Tinder for VEGETABLES’ lets Brits combat food waste by putting their leftovers to use,"SWIPE right - a new tool is helping the nation to combat food waste by finding 'soilmates' for their leftover veg. The site lets people choose the unwanted vegetables sitting in their fridge drawers and produces tasty and waste-free recipe suggestions which put them to good use. It comes as a study of 2,000 adults found a fifth consider themselves a ‘fruit and veg snob’, with 21 per cent admitting they even discard certain items because of how they look - despite being edible. The average person throws away 10 per cent of fruit and veg away each week despite nearly a third (29 per cent) of their bill going on these items during their typical weekly food shop. Oddbox, which is passionate about fighting food waste, created the dating inspired tool to rescue and match lonely fruit and veg together, and inspire adults to get creative in the kitchen. Heather Lynch, head of impact for the fruit and veg delivery company, which also commissioned the study, said: ""We want to change the destiny of thousands of vegetables, to help fight food waste and create tasty plates of food in the process. “Not knowing what to do with leftover vegetables, or a lack of inspiration to turn them into delicious meals is one of the most common causes of food waste at home. “‘Soilmates’ gives people the help they need to fight food waste in a fun and engaging way.” Salad leaves, cucumber and tomatoes are among the most common items to be discarded with 38 per cent doing so as a result of them going out of date faster than they expected. Nearly a sixth (15 per cent) only need to use a few products but can’t help that they come in a multipack – leading them to discard the not needed - while 28 per cent simply forget they are in the fridge. But encouragingly, only 12 per cent admit to buying things when they know it’s more than likely they won’t get eaten. Nearly seven in 10 (69 per cent) of those who do this claim the intentions are there while 47 per cent just want to appear healthy. Shamefully, 36 per cent only buy these healthy foods because they want their fridge to look colourful. Of all those polled in the OnePoll study, making soup (43 per cent) was the most popular option for what to do with any ‘ugly’ fruit and vegetables while 23 per cent prefer to turn them into smoothies. When thinking of the fruit and veg most likely to be uneaten, 28 per cent would refuse an artichoke and 21 per cent would turn their nose up at an avocado. Strawberries were voted the nation’s favourite food with potatoes, bananas and mushrooms following closely behind. More than half (53 per cent) admit they need to eat more fruit and veg than they currently do as 55 per cent say they want more variety when it comes to their overall diet and meal planning. Nearly four in 10 (39 per cent) are guilty of often repeating the same recipes each week with 21 per cent saying they lack creativity in the kitchen. However, 42 per cent don’t let innovation issues get in the way and will typically try to find a substitute if they are missing an ingredient. Oddbox is working with internet sensation and food-waste disruptor, Martyn Odell - otherwise known as ‘Lagom Chef’ - to demonstrate how easy it is to use up unwanted vegetables. Martyn Odell said: “The new ‘Soilmates’ tool is an amazing way to reduce food waste and get people experimenting with fruits and vegetables they haven’t tried before. “For example, something like beetroot isn’t on many people's weekly food shop, but there are many ways to use them, from soups to salads, and ‘Soilmates’ will provide people with a range of recipes if they are unsure what to do.” 1.                  Salad leaves (bagged) 2.                  Bananas 3.                  Lettuce (whole) 4.                  Cucumber 5.                  Tomatoes 6.                  Carrots 7.                  Mushrooms 8.                  Potato 9.                  Grapes 10.                Strawberries 11.                Spinach 12.                Apples 13.                Oranges 14.                Broccoli 15.                Avocado 16.                Celery 17.                Raspberries 18.                Onions 19.                Cabbage 20.                Blueberries ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21321493/tinder-for-vegetables-food-waste-leftovers/
Cops fear Nicola Bulley ‘could have left river on path NOT covered by CCTV’ as diver admits he can’t find her in water,"COPS fear Nicola Bulley may have left the river on a path not covered by CCTV as a dive expert admitted he couldn't find her in the water.  Police have been working on the ""hypothesis"" that the mum-of-two slipped into the icy water and drowned. But last night police said it was still a ""possibility"" she left the area by one path not covered by cameras.  The path is crossed by the main road through the village.  They said officers were trying to trace dashcam footage from 700 drivers who passed along the road at the time she disappeared, around 9.20am on January 27.  It comes after the dive expert scouring the river in the search for Nicola said his team will end their efforts later today. Peter Faulding said they have done all they can to try and find the missing mum-of-two who vanished on almost two weeks ago.  He told reporters this afternoon: “Wherever she is I hope closure comes soon. ""All the family are clearly distraught.""  Discussing search progress, the dive leader said there is simply ""no sign"" of Nicola near to where she vanished around St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire. He explained: ""We've cleared completely the area where the bench is and about a mile up from the bench, where the phone was initially found. ""We've run the side scan sonar from here down to the next bridge, which is about three or four miles away and there is no sign of Nicola in that particular area. ""We've done very thorough searches all the way down to the weir. I'm totally baffled by this one, to be honest.” He spent 10-minutes walking the river bank near the bench where Ms Bulley's phone was found, still connected to a work Teams call. Nicola, a mortgage adviser from nearby Inskip, was last seen walking her dog at around 9.15am the day she vanished. She had dropped off her daughters, aged six and nine, at school before heading to the towpath near the River Wyre. Monday's search for Nicola focused downstream on the tidal area of the river but Tuesday's search took place further upstream. It included and went beyond the area where Nicola's belongings were found on a bench near Garstang Road. It is a non-tidal area of the river.

I’m a detective & there are Nicola Bulley updates that cops aren’t telling public – here’s why probe is so difficult,"A FORMER detective has said that there are updates in the Nicola Bulley case that cops are not telling the public. Nicola, a mortgage adviser from nearby Inskip, Lancashire, was last seen walking her dog at around 9.15am on January 27. The 45-year-old mum had dropped off her daughters, aged six and nine, at school before heading to the towpath near the River Wyre. Her phone, still connected to a Teams call, was found on a bench on a steep riverbank overlooking the water, along with the dog lead and harness on the ground. Cops, emergency services and specialist divers have scoured the area since she went missing but her disappearance still remains a mystery. Now, Dr Graham Hill says that there are ""lots of things"" happening in the search for Nicola that the public aren't aware of due to the complex nature of the case. The leading abduction expert said: ""It must be extremely difficult for the investigation team. These are critical incidents and police forces train for these situations. ""There are lots of things happening right now that the public isn’t aware of. ""All the speculation and people coming forward and suggesting things - perhaps they’re trying to be helpful - but the art of dealing with these incidents is dealing with a lot of information quickly. ""They are assessing everything, looking into it, making decisions and taking action very quickly. ""Obviously that gets much harder when the investigation team is getting awash with lots of information. ""I feel for the people for trying to do the job but I understand why the family is getting frustrated. The police are damned if they do and dammed if you don’t. ""They say she’s in the river and they get criticised, they say she may not be in the river and they’re criticised."" Dr Hill added that the public scrutiny into the investigation had made everything ""much harder"" for the cops. He continued: ""I’ve run these investigations - and If I was the senior detective charged with running this investigation I would not be very happy. ""Everything that is going on is making the investigation much harder. ""This is difficult work, it's difficult to do in the public eye under a spotlight. ""And it's even more difficult when people are coming up with crackpot theories. The area is getting awash with people macabre sightseers. ""It's really difficult for the investigations team. They can’t cordon off the whole river."" ""This is difficult work - it's hard to do in the public eye under a spotlight."" Today, Peter Faulding, said his team have done all they can to try and find Nicola as he called off the search. Discussing search progress, the dive leader said there is simply ""no sign"" of Nicola near to where she vanished around St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire. Mr Faulding is the founder of private forensic searchers Specialist Group International (SGI) from Surrey. The team were drafted in on Monday to assist police divers in to search the river bed with Sonar. Detectives say their ""main working hypothesis"" is that she fell into the river and Superintendent Sally Riley, from Lancashire Police, reiterated this at a news conference on Tuesday. But Nicola's family and friends have previously claimed there is ""no evidence whatsoever"" behind this. It comes as Ms Bulley's partner visited the place where police believe she fell into the River Wyre. Paul Ansell spent 10 minutes on Wednesday along the riverbank near the bench where the mum's phone was found, still connected to a work Teams call.

Mum of baby son ‘killed by boyfriend in “torture” campaign’ joked bruised tot looked like ‘little madman’ in texts,"A MUM joked her bruised son looked like a ""little madman"" in texts to the partner accused of shaking him to death, a court heard. Louise Lennon, 32, and Jake Drummond, 33, also allegedly messaged each other a reference to putting 15-month-old Jacob in a ""torture chamber"". The mum is accused of causing or allowing the death of a child and child cruelty, while Drummond is charged with murder. He allegedly shook little Jacob to death at home in Roehampton, South West London, after taking cocaine with a friend. The Old Bailey heard Drummond waged a campaign of deliberate assaults on the toddler that Lennon did nothing to stop. On August 27, 2019, the mum called 999 claiming Jacob had bumped his head ""like he fell out of bed or something"", it is said. She also allegedly claimed her son had tripped on their way back from a supermarket. Medics found his eyes were so swollen he could not open them and he ""looked like a panda"" because he had such dark bruises, jurors were told. He also had bruises on his forehead and head while his skull was ""almost soft and spongy-like"". The court heard his genitals were swollen and he had an injury on them consistent with ""extreme pinching"" or biting. Traces of cocaine were also found in his system after he died, jurors were told. A post-mortem found Jacob died after multiple episodes of inflicted trauma culminating in the infliction of the fatal head injury. The pathologist also found it is likely Jacob hit his head against a blunt surface while he was being shaken, it is said. Jacob had several previous injuries that were days to weeks old and a ""final"" injury which was less than two days old. Prosecutor Sally O'Neill KC told jurors: ""It is the Crown's case that Jake Drummond had embarked on a campaign of deliberately assaulting and hurting Jacob between July and the end of August. ""The injuries which he caused were obvious and noticeable. ""It is clear that at some stage that night, if Jacob was in bed with Louise Lennon at 1am, someone must have taken him out of the bed. ""It is also clear that at some stage, someone, the Crown say Jake Drummond, seriously assaulted Jacob by shaking him and hitting him so severely that he became unconscious. ""It is almost inconceivable that Louise Lennon would not have heard the sounds of that assault, but even if she didn't … she not only did nothing about it but contrived with Jake Drummond to concoct a story to try and create a completely false account of what had happened to Jacob. ""The events schedule demonstrates for you what the priorities were for these defendants. Jacob's well-being did not feature in that list. They were concerned only for themselves and their own needs and interests."" The couple deny the charges and the trial continues.

Geordies are the most house proud in UK – but where does YOUR city rank in the top 10?,"THE most house-proud cities in the UK are Newcastle, Southampton and Glasgow – with last year’s winner Oxford not even appearing in the list. For a third year, researchers polled 2,597 homeowners to determine where the most house-proud Brits live. Each city was awarded points based on their efforts to improve and upkeep their homes during the past year - considering things such as money spent on improvements, and time spent cleaning. Despite the ongoing cost-of-living crisis, homeowners from Glasgow spent more on their abodes than any other city in the past year - £5,940. In comparison, the national average spend on homes was £3,375 – £669 more than in 2021. The Scottish city also spent the most time tidying their properties – five hours and 43 minutes each week – and used the most tradespeople with a total of seven. While Newcastle took the lead for having the lowest number of unfinished DIY jobs in their home compared to the previous year. The research was commissioned by Checkatrade as part of its annual Home Pride Index report [https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/news/home-pride-index-2023/] which found 55 per cent of homeowners claim they are ‘house-proud’, compared to 49 per cent 12 months ago. London moved from being the second most house-proud city in 2021 to sixth position in 2022, while Brighton and Hove, which was previously in joint seventh place with Southampton, fell to fifteenth. Mike Fairman, CEO at Checkatrade said: “Homeowners are more resilient than ever, not letting the cost-of-living deter them from home improvement projects. “With the current uncertainty of the housing market, increased investments in spaces like lofts suggest homeowners are looking to make the most of what they have versus selling up and purchasing another property and are seeking support from experienced tradespeople to help.” The research also found homeowners polled, via OnePoll, spent the most money improving or renovating their kitchen than any other room, an average of £1,106. However, loft installations saw the biggest spike in investment compared to the previous year with an increase of 432 per cent - from an average of £153 in 2021 to £814 in 2022. Top reasons for doing work to the home were due to spending more time there and wanting to improve the surroundings (32 per cent), fixing wear and tear (30 per cent) and being more efficient in response to the energy crisis (23 per cent). But even though people invested more in their homes in the past year, 61 per cent spent less than they would have liked because of the cost-of-living crisis. They instead pivoted to smaller, more affordable changes to refresh their living spaces, including painting walls and ceilings (29 per cent), redecorating the living room (26 per cent) and getting new soft furnishings (26 per cent). Mike Fairman added: “It’s indisputable that a house is more than a home, and the nation’s pride in where they live remains despite the numerous challenges faced over the year. “Whether it’s injecting colour into the living room, undertaking a loft conversion or reducing its carbon footprint, taking care of your home can help your home take care of you. “The nation’s growing focus on making smaller, everyday changes to give spaces a refresh is set to continue throughout 2023 and we cannot wait to see what new - and old - trends this year brings.’’ Newcastle – 88 points Southampton – 82 points Glasgow – 80 points Wrexham – 74 points Sheffield – 72 points London – 70 points York – 68 points Liverpool - 65.5 points Manchester – 65 points Cardiff – 62 points Cambridge - 54 / Leicester – 54 points Belfast – 51 points Plymouth – 50 points Bristol – 48 points Brighton & Hove - 47.5 points Wolverhampton – 47 points Edinburgh – 46 points Chelmsford – 43 points Norwich – 41 points Leeds – 29 points MONEY SPENT ON IMPROVEMENTS AND RENOVATIONS Highest: Glasgow - £5,940 Lowest: Leeds - £1,697 PROPORTION OF RESPONDENTS WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES TO BE HOUSE-PROUD: Highest: Sheffield - 70 per cent Lowest: Plymouth - 45 per cent TIME SPENT CLEANING/TIDYING THE HOME PER WEEK: Highest: Glasgow - 5 hours 43 minutes Lowest: Coventry - 3 hours NUMBER OF TRADESPEOPLE USED PER HOME ON AVERAGE: Highest: Glasgow - 7 Lowest: Norwich - 3 PROPORTION OF HOMES WHO HAVE FEWER DIY JOBS LEFT TO DO THIS YEAR COMPARED TO LAST YEAR: Highest: Newcastle - 9 Lowest: Leeds - 1 ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21321434/house-proud-uk-geordies/
Disneyland guests have to be rescued by firefighters after Pirates of the Caribbean boat ride ‘SINKS’,"DISNEYLAND visitors were left stranded on a ""sinking"" ride as the boats they were in started to flood. Shocking footage shows panic erupt as the packed Pirates of the Caribbean ride at the theme park in California began filling with water. Horrified guests said they were left stuck in the boats for an hour before they were rescued. A clip shared on TikTok shows people trying to prop their legs up to avoid getting wet. Firefighters had to be called to help visitors exit the ride via a plank. Footage shows the rescue workers holding guests' hands as they balanced on the beam to get out of the boats. Justin James was on the ride when it malfunctioned on Tuesday and shared dramatic footage of water pouring into the boats. The professional photographer said: ""It was a hot mess. ""Honestly thought we were gonna swim our way out of this."" He said disappointed guests were given vouchers to buy dry socks and allowed to skip queues for other rides as compensation. Justin added: ""All they gave us was some $30 vouchers for socks and single lightning lanes."" The Pirates of the Caribbean ride is located in New Orleans Square at California's Disneyland Park in the city of Anaheim.  According to Disneyland's website, it is ""considered one of the most immersive attractions ever created"" for a theme park. It is designed for all ages and was opened in March 1967. The Sun has contacted Disneyland for comment. It comes after Disney World Florida guests said they suffered ""torture"" after getting stuck on the It's a Small World ride for an hour as music played the whole time.

I found a purse bulging with cash – I very nearly spent it but my last minute U-turn ended with an even bigger reward,"A GRANDMOTHER has befriended an unlikely companion after he returned her missing wallet. When 61-year-old Dee Harkrider lost her wallet after a trip to Walmart, she didn't expect to find it again. But when the Arkansas native checked Facebook, she discovered a message from Delivontae Johnson, 19, letting her know he found it. Delivontae had parked in a pharmacy parking spot to run into Walmart when he noticed a wallet sitting on a shopping cart. He picked up the wallet and pocketed it, planning to fix his spare tire with the money. But then he thought about his plan, and decided it was best to find the owner of the wallet. Delivontae said:“I didn't know if she was going to come back to Walmart looking for a wallet that wasn't there. ""If they would have watched the cameras and seen I’d picked up a wallet, the police would have been at my house."" After finding Dee's drivers liscense, he began driving to her home and messaged her on Facebook to alert her to his discovery. But Dee was in the next city over, so Delivontae drove to another town to drop off her wallet. He told USA Today: “I wasn’t supposed to be parking in that spot but thank God I did."" They met in a restaurant parking lot, where Dee took a photo of the pair together that went viral on Facebook. Dee said: “I wanted people to know what this young man had done for me. I had to share it."" As a reward for his honesty and kindness, Dee decided to give Delivontae a $20 bill from her wallet. Delivontae said the reward was more than he expected, and that it felt great to do something selfless. Dee said: ""People need to know that it doesn't hurt to do a good deed nowadays."" Last year, an Australian man was reunited with his wallet 26 years after he lost it on a beach. Paul Davis lost his wallet in 1994, while celebrating on New Years Eve with friends in New South Wales.

Major Nicola Bulley update as cops focus search on area downstream towards the sea,"COPS will now focus their search for missing mum Nicola Bulley downstream towards the sea, a dive expert says.  Nicola, 45, was last seen in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, at around 9.15am on January 27. Since then, there has been no trace of the mum with the search now reaching its 12th painstaking day. Police and volunteers have scoured land and water to try to find the mum-of-two, but to no avail.  Earlier today a dive expert searching the river said his team will end their efforts by sunset.  Peter Faulding said they have done all they can to try to find Nicola.  However, he said police are now honing their efforts into further downstream.  Peter said: “The police divers have dived it three times extremely thoroughly, and they are highly competent as we are and that area is completely negative. ""There is no sign of Nicola in that particular area. “The main focus now would be to the police are continuing their investigation down the river, which leads eventually out to the estuary. “There's still no sign of Nicola. We've run the side scan sonar from here down to the next bridge, which is about three or four miles away and there is no sign of Nicola in that particular area.”  It comes as police revealed there was a ""possibility"" the mum had actually left the river path on foot.  They said one particular area was not covered by CCTV.  This morning Nicola's distraught partner Paul Ansell visited the scene this morning. He spent 10 minutes walking the river bank near the bench where the mum's phone was found, still connected to a work Teams call. In the hours that followed dive expert Peter told reporters he was calling off his search.  He said: “Wherever she is I hope closure comes soon. ""All the family are clearly distraught."" Nicola, a mortgage adviser from nearby Inskip, was last seen walking her dog at around 9.15am the day she vanished. She had dropped off her daughters, aged six and nine, at school before heading to the towpath near the River Wyre.

Fury at Nicola Bulley ‘ghouls’ travelling miles to take sick selfies at bench where missing mum’s phone found,"A LOCAL parish chairman has slammed ""ghouls"" who have travelled miles to take sick selfies at the bench where Nicola Bulley's phone was found. Nicola, a mortgage adviser from nearby Inskip, Lancashire, was last seen walking her dog at around 9.15am on January 27. The 45-year-old mum had dropped off her daughters, aged six and nine, at school before heading to the towpath near the River Wyre. Her phone, still connected to a Teams call, was found on a bench along with the dog lead and harness on the ground. Visitors have reportedly travelled miles from as far afield as Lancaster and Manchester to watch the search in action. And people have reportedly been taking disrespectful selfies at the bench where Nicola's phone was found. One photo posted to Snapchat showed a car with flashing lights captioned ""long walk on the search for the missing person"". It led the area's parish council chairman to blast the disrespectful behaviour and remind visitors the search for Ms Bulley was not a ""spectator sport"". Giles Phillips said: ""It would be helpful if people could let the authorities do their jobs. ""We don't want anyone to hinder the investigation. This is not a spectator sport. ""Most of the area is private land. The public access is very minimal and can't absorb the numbers of people who are coming every day. ""They aren't searching for somebody. They are watching someone else search for somebody. "" Cops, emergency services and specialist divers have scoured the area since she went missing but her disappearance still remains a mystery. Today, Peter Faulding, said his team have done all they can to try and find Nicola as he called off the search. Discussing search progress, the dive leader said there is simply ""no sign"" of Nicola near to where she vanished around St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire. Mr Faulding is the founder of private forensic searchers Specialist Group International (SGI) from Surrey. The team were drafted in on Monday to assist police divers in to search the river bed with Sonar. Detectives say their ""main working hypothesis"" is that she fell into the river and Superintendent Sally Riley, from Lancashire Police, reiterated this at a news conference on Tuesday. But Nicola's family and friends have previously claimed there is ""no evidence whatsoever"" behind this. More than 500 lines of inquiry are being looked into by 40 detectives and more than 700 drivers are being traced for dashcam footage which may help the investigation. Police said there have been no sightings of Nicola leaving the area, but one exit from the river walk is not covered by CCTV. Cops are now focusing search efforts on the track from the fields, where she was last seen, to Garstang Road in St Michaels on Wyre, which may hold vital clues. It comes as Ms Bulley's partner visited the place where police believe she fell into the River Wyre. Paul Ansell spent 10 minutes on Wednesday along the riverbank near the bench where the mum's phone was found, still connected to a work Teams call.

At least 2 kids killed & 6 injured after bus crashes into nursery as cops arrest driver,"TWO kids have been killed after a bus ploughed into a nursery. Cops have arrested the driver on suspicion of homicide after the vehicle crashed into a daycare centre in Laval, Canada. Panicked parents rushed to the scene as dozens of police and emergency vehicles lined the road. Authorities say two children have been confirmed dead. Another six kids were injured and have been taken to hospital. The driver, 51, has been arrested on suspicion of homicide and reckless driving, police say. He has worked for Societe de transport de Laval for ten years, Laval Mayor Stephane Boyer said. The circumstances around the crash or a possible motive are not clear. But Ms Boyer said: ""There is a theory that it was an intentional act, but that remains to be confirmed by the investigation."" Around 80 kids under the age of five attend the nursery, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. The ages of the youngster killed and hurt have not been confirmed, however. Hamdi Benchaabane, who lives near the site, said he rushed to the scene following the crash at around 8.30am local time (1.30pm GMT). He said he and three other parents managed to ""subdue"" the driver before police handcuffed him. Mr Benchaabane added: ""The first thing he did was take off all his clothes after opening the bus door. ""He was just yelling; there were no words coming out of his mouth."" Mr Benchaabane said he was able to help pull one child from the daycare, adding that he and the others tried to save a second child before firefighters ordered them to leave because pieces of the roof were at risk of falling. He added: ""It was a nightmare, I can't believe it, he said of what he witnessed. It was horrible."" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, as well as Quebec Premier Francois Legault, expressed condolences to families after the incident. He said: ""No words can take away the pain and fear that parents, children, and workers are feeling – but we are here for you."" Quebec's Families Minister Suzanne Roy said: ""Everyone is terribly saddened by what has occurred. ""When you leave your children at the daycare for the day, you know that they're in good hands ... when an event like that can happen, it shakes us and shatters us."" Laval is about 30km northwest of Montreal in Quebec, Canada's second most-populous province. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21322305/kids-killed-injured-bus-crashes-nursery/
President Zelensky makes desperate plea for Britain to give Ukraine fighter jets to beat Putin,"UKRAINE'S hero Volodymyr Zelensky flew to Britain to make desperate plea: ""Give us your fighter jets"".  The war-weary President heaped pressure on Rishi Sunak as he begged for “wings for freedom” on the eve of the first anniversary of Putin's devastating invasion. The Prime Minister last night said that “nothing was off the table” as the UK began to train Ukrainian pilots on our fleet of Typhoon jets during the President's surprise visit.  But he stopped well short of promising to hand over part of our 137 strong stockpile.  Mr Sunak said sending the extra air support had been part of the discussions during the historic visit but training pilots for the Typhoon fleet can take up to FIVE years and at least THREE.  But the President insisted it could be done in just six months when asked by The Sun if he believed the excuses not to send jets.  Speaking in Lulworth Camp in Dorset, he said:  “When it comes to Typhoons, you know I didn’t even I didn’t even know that it takes three years to train pilots like that. You know, come on, we will be sending you pilots who’ve already trained for two and a half years.” Mr Sunak pointedly added:  “We’ll accelerate the last bit.”   The PM added there were issues with the supply chain and dealing with allies before making a final decision but moved significantly further than previous rejections of supplying jets.   He added: “There is a supply chain around such sophisticated aircraft. “Those are conversations that the president and I are having and making sure we understand all the supply chain needs that go alongside aircraft like that - making sure they can be used and used safely, kept safely. So we are having that conversation. “And it is also a conversation we are having with our allies because, particularly some of the aircraft we have, are done through joint treaty with multiple other countries - I think we have seen that with previous bits of kit that others have had to give. But without the extra support, Zelensky  added that there would be a risk of “stagnation” in the struggle against the Russian invaders. He added:  “You’ve just asked me what would happen if we don’t get these fighter jets or longer-range missiles, or we don’t have enough ammunition, because everything obviously is running out and coming out of maintenance. “Without the weapons that we are discussing now and the weapons that we just discussed with Rishi earlier today and how Britain is going to help us, you know, all of this is very important. What does Ukraine want?  Ukraine wants Britain to send a fleet of its cutting-edge fighter jets to help take out Putin’s positions. This would most likely be lethal £100m Typhoon planes, which are equipped with short and medium air-to-air missiles.  What is Britain currently doing?  Britain has agreed to train Ukrainian pilots on our “Nato-standard” jets but has not made a commitment to supply the country with them. Instead Rishi Sunak has asked the Defence Secretary Ben Wallace to “investigate” the long-term feasibility of sending planes.  Why won’t Britain agree to send the jets? Downing Street insists our fighter jets are “complex” planes and can take years of training to fly. And by the time the pilots are ready to use them, it is unclear what the state of the war will be. Mr Sunak is also bound by the approval of Western allies, as sending Typhoons would require the support of Germany, Italy and Spain.  Will Rishi Sunak eventually agree? Political pressure is mounting on the PM, not least from President Zelensky himself who last night disputed how long it would take to train up his pilots. Boris Johnson is also turning the screw on his successor to send Ukraine the jets it wants. “Without this, there would be stagnation which will not bring to anything good.” But the intervention saw some  reluctance from Downing Street despite ex-Prime Minister Boris Johnson demanding they be sent to eastern Europe immediately. Sunak has tasked Defence Secretary Ben Wallace with investigating what jets we might be sent but this is seen as a long term solution as pilots need five years training.   They will likely be trained on British typhoons when they come here. Boris Johnson last night told successor Mr Sunak that “now is the time” to hand over the jets. He urged his successor to answer Zelensky’s call in the same way we sent “Hawker Hurricanes and Spitfires” to the Polish in WW2 to shoot down Nazis. Mr Johnson told LBC “the faster we do it, the bigger the saving in life” so Ukraine can destroy Russia’s strategic positions. He added: “It is time to give the Ukrainians the extra equipment they need to defeat Putin and to restore peace to Ukraine. That means longer range missiles and artillery. “It means more tanks. It means planes. We have more than 100 Typhoon jets. We have more than 100 Challenger 2 tanks. “The best single use for any of these items is to deploy them now for the protection of the Ukrainians - not least because that is how we guarantee our own long-term security.” Zelensky arrived on a C-17 RAF flight amid tight security  at Stansted, Essex, shortly after 10am when he sat alongside Mr Sunak on the hour-long trip back to Downing Street. He enjoyed a continental breakfast brunch of bagels and croissants in the PM’s flat before heading to Westminster Hall - where the Queen lay in State last September - for his keynote address. He used the trip to London to keep pressure on for more support declaring that winning against Russia would be  “the most important victory of our lifetime”. The visit comes  ahead of meeting the leaders of the 27 EU members today in Brussels following a whistle-stop trip to Paris last night to meet France President Emmanual Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

Private school head Emma Pattison and killer husband enjoyed last supper with pals hours before his bloody rampage,"PRIVATE school head Emma Pattison and her killer husband enjoyed a last supper with friends hours before he went on his bloody rampage. George Pattison, 39, gave no sign of being upset as he and Emma, 45, gave a dinner party in the grounds of Epsom College. But he snapped in the early hours of the next morning and blasted Emma and daughter Lettie, seven, to death before shooting himself. A friend said: “On Saturday night they threw a dinner party. It was quite an intimate affair and literally turned out to be their last supper. “Nothing unusual happened. There were no arguments, no indication he would go on to do something so horrific a short time later.” Surrey Police are trying to piece together events — but days earlier they visited accountant Pattison after he notified them of a change of address for his gun licence. He had only recently moved out of their former home in Caterham to join the family at the house at the £42,000-a-year school. Pattison also reported his wife to the police for assault in 2016 but later withdrew his complaint. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21322532/epsom-emma-pattison-killer-husband-supper/
We won £33m in lottery – neighbours tried to stop us knocking down bungalow for our dream house… we took them on & WON,"A COUPLE took on their neighbours objections so they could build their dream house after winning jackpot lotto. Lisa Charters and husband Craig have been given the go-ahead to knock down a bungalow and replace it with a £5million mansion.  The young couple from Scotland are ready to settle down after travelling the world - but left their neighbours fuming with their extravagant plans.  The luxury three-storey home will be in a suburb of Edinburgh with views of the castle.  The pair plan to demolish the £870,000 three-bed bungalow and replace it with the architect-designed modernist mansion. Blueprints made public last year revealed the glittering zinc, bricks and glass vision were like something you'd see on Grand Designs. Edinburgh Council received 63 letters of objections against the plans for the three-storey home. However, Lisa and Craig have since been given permission after councillors visited the site. Local councillor Euan Hyslop said he understands the concerns but is in full support of the application, reports the Daily Record. He said: ""I think it is a fitting addition.  ""It is modern, uncompromisingly modern, which is a good way of putting it - but I think it is an architecturally really interesting application. ""It is a welcome application and I will be supporting it.” One property developer, who builds homes for millionaires, said: ""It is quite a spectacular home but the first thing that strikes you about it is the sheer scale of the place. ""There also appears to be a fairly dramatic driveway which curves up to the property, something you would expect to see in the Hollywood Hills.  ""This has the potential to be a £5 million house.""

George Pattison’s movements in the weeks before ‘killing his headmistress wife and daughter’ are revealed,"GEORGE Pattison's movements in the weeks before he allegedly killed his wife and daughter have been revealed.  The chartered accountant, 39, is believed to have shot headmistress Emma and seven-year-old Lettie before turning the gun on himself. Shocking details have emerged since the bodies were found on the grounds of Epsom College, Surrey, around 1am on Sunday. According to neighbours, in the weeks leading up to the deaths George had a ""lot of time on his hands"". One said: ""I think he may have worked at home a bit but I got the impression he had a lot of time on his hands. ""I'd see him through the window drinking glasses of red wine in his new kitchen extension."" Emma was appointed head of the prestigious private school in September 2022 and moved into a property on-site. A former neighbour said George, who had a shotgun licence, was living separate to his family when they first got the keys to the Epsom property. They told the MailOnline: ""I wasn't sure if anybody had actually moved out because I'd seen George quite recently, in the run up to Christmas. ""I hadn't seen [Emma] nor her daughter since last summer. I think she moved out before George."" Sources have claimed George had no criminal history and was not on Surrey Police's radar. Despite this, he was in contact with officers just days before the killings. However, cops said this was for a ""routine"" change of address on his gun licence. It is assumed this was because he had officially moved into the family home at Epsom College. Due to the short period of time between the licence update and alleged killing, the incident has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). Detectives are now ""working around the clock"" to piece together what happened before the double murder-suicide. Detective Chief Inspector Kimball Edey, Senior Investigating Officer on the case, said today: ""This is an incredibly traumatic incident and we are working around the clock to investigate and understand the exact circumstances which led to this point. ""We understand the public concern and upset, and we will clarify what we can, when we can, while respecting the right to a level of privacy for the families of those who have lost their lives. ""We are cooperating fully with the IOPC in relation to the referral we have made, and we await the outcome of its assessment of what further action may be required.""

Shocking footage inside Ukraine’s bloodiest battle where troops have a 4-hour life expectancy as Zelensky begs for help,"HORRIFYING footage lays bare the shocking plight of soldiers caught up in Ukraine's bloodiest battle. The small city of Bakhmut is facing a fierce Russian onslaught from three sides - with Ukrainian forces fighting there claiming they have just a four-hour life expectancy.  Vladimir Putin's butchers have been attempting to claim the eastern city for more than six months, but have been held off by stiff Ukrainian resistance. But despite Ukrainian defenders continuing to push back, the harrowing reality of the battle can be seen in footage from the ground. A once popular tourist destination, Bakhmut has largely been reduced to ruin. The city has been hollowed out by artillery fire and levelled by carpet bombing - with its frozen ground carved up by craters and trenches. Fresh footage shows soldiers locked in bitter battles with tanks. Thick plumes of smoke can be seen rising from the city as tanks fire relentlessly and troops scramble for cover. It also reveals a city razed to the ground, with buildings left as collapsed, smoldering wreckages and the ground soaked with blood. Meanwhile, another clip shows flames erupting as huge explosions rip through the city. According to soldiers on the frontline, avoiding being killed is near impossible as they are often outnumbered ten to one by Russian troops. A Ukrainian reporter speaking to one Ukrainian fighter in the city was told: “The average lifespan for mobilised fighters in Bakhmut is four hours”. Ukrainian officials have referred to their role on the battlefield as “cannon fodder”. One soldier, Andriy, told CNN: “We were fighting for about 10 hours in a row. ""And it wasn’t like just waves, it was uninterrupted. So it was just like they didn’t stop coming.  ""It was about 20 soldiers on our side. And let’s say 200 from their side."" He described fighting the convict army as a scene from a zombie movie, adding: “They’re climbing above the corpse of their friends, stepping on them."" Moscow is desperate to seize Bakhmut, as it could severely disrupt Ukraine's military supply routes. It would also open a door for Russia's forces to drive toward key Ukrainian strongholds in Donetsk. It comes as Zelensky on Wednesday begged Rishi Sunak to provide Ukraine with fighter jets in an emotional landmark speech to Parliament. In the grand Westminster Hall, Ukraine's hero President pleaded for planes - ""wings for freedom"" - to help his country crush evil tyrant Putin. In his first visit to the UK since Russia's invasion, the President said: ""I appeal to you and the world with simple and yet the most important words. ""Combat aircrafts for Ukraine. Wings for freedom."" So far Britain, the US and Germany have refused to send aircrafts to Ukraine over fears of provoking Mad Vlad Putin. But in a powerful plea to hundreds of MPs and peers, Zelensky implored Mr Sunak to think again. He even joked: ""Thank all of you in advance for powerful English planes."" Zelensky added: ""Great Britain, you and us both struggle for peace. ""Unfortunately, it is in human nature to allow evil. We must make sure it doesn't stand up against humanity. It destroys and kills and breaks people's lives."" Meanwhile, Nato troops have taken part in terrifying World War I-style trench drills as they stand braced for war with tyrant Putin. The chilling war games took place just 80 miles from the Russian border in -12C temperatures using the world's most lethal tanks and high-tech weapons.

A shocking increase has seen their yearly bills go from £36,000 to £119,000. They are expected to then jump again to £155,000 by next year. School bosses have said the decision is with ""huge regret"" but they have no other choice.  Headteacher Simon Billings said ""something has to give"" to ensure they can cope. He told the Daily Gazette: ""It is an absolute tragedy and a horrible situation for our school to be in – it will have ramifications across every department.

Vets use bizarre trick to keep wildlife park’s penguins still for X-rays,"VETS are being flipping clever by popping traffic cones over penguins — to keep them still for X-rays. The novel approach has resulted in perfect images. Ageing birds have to be X-rayed to check their joints for stiffness or arthritis. Vets at Curraghs Wildlife Park on the Isle of Man adopted the cone idea for their Humboldt penguins. General manager Kathleen Graham said: “Our vets suggested using a traffic cone after seeing a post from another zoo that used the same method. “So it’s not an original idea, but none the less a good one. “It does save the stress, extra risk and time of an anaesthesia, so an imaginative way to use a cone for animal welfare advancement.” Kathleen then added: “We are glad to report after x-rays of our older penguins, they are still doing well, health check ups as we get older are important. “By X-ray we can assess how their joints are doing and if any medication is needed. “Thanks to Anna and Jakub our vets for coming up with a great way of making the process stress free by using a traffic cone to keep them still without the need of an aesthetic.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21323130/vets-bizarre-trick-penguins-x-rays/
My horse was kicked out of her posh stables because I work as a £5k a month OnlyFans model – it’s humiliating,"A RIDER and her horse were booted out of a posh stables — because she works as an OnlyFans model. Honour Spencer, 27, was given ten days to quit the high-end equestrian centre, which charged £630 a month to look after her horse Cherry. She was told in a message by a stables worker Ross Evans: “You are a lovely person.  ""However, unfortunately, we are not comfortable with the industry that you work in, which has been brought to my attention, and the different various people you have brought to the yard.” Honour, who makes £5,000 a month on the adult site, said: “It’s absolutely horrific — I’ve been discriminated against because of my job.” Honour moved 14-year-old Cherry into the Marbury Equestrian Centre, Cheshire, three days before Christmas. Mr Evans’ message giving her ten days’ notice arrived on New Year’s Eve. He offered her a full refund and help with transport to another stables. Honour replied saying she had done nothing wrong and had always been respectful to staff at the stables. She told him: “A person’s job doesn’t define a person’s personality. I am deeply hurt.” However, Mr Evans insisted the decision had been made by the yard’s business partners and managers. Honour has since moved Cherry to a different livery nearby, which has no problems with her job. The centre has been contacted for comment.

Killer who brutally murdered Brit headmistress on solo tour of the Amazon arrested while taking daughter to hospital,"A KILLER who brutally murdered a Brit headmistress on a solo tour of the Amazon has been arrested after almost six years on the run. Emma Kelty, 43, was killed by ruthless river pirates who shot her and slit her throat before throwing her body into a river in Brazil to be eaten by piranhas in 2017. Her body has never been found. Arthur Gomes da Silva was sentenced to almost 30 years in prison but escaped authorities soon after. Five and a half years later, the evil killer has been snared by cops after taking his daughter to hospital in Manaus. Police said hospital workers noticed his ""suspicious movement"" and called the cops, reports Amazonas Atual. Vile da Silva was convicted of corruption of minors, robbery-homicide, rape, and concealment of a corpse in 2017. He confessed to slitting her throat and throwing her bullet-riddled body into the Solimoes River. Da Silva was one of six pirates who ambushed Emma in her tent as she camped on a beach in a remote area of Coari. She was blasted twice with a sawn-off shotgun by a violent gang who took her camera, a drone, computer and two phones. Police said da Silva was the one who raped and killed her. Former headteacher Emma, from Finchley, North West London, was attempting a 4,000-mile solo kayak journey from the source of the Amazon in Peru to its mouth on the Atlantic Ocean when she was attacked. Police said the gang operated like pirates who went out in a canoe looking to steal. They targeted Emma at random 42 days into her trip when they saw her tent on the beach in an area known as the Solimoes River, between the cities of Coari and Codajas. According to cops, she was cut near her neck and shoulder to attract piranha fish after she was murdered. Emma had quit as head of Knollmead Primary in Surbiton, Surrey to travel. Two weeks before she was murdered, her family was told she had been killed in a harrowing false alarm. When tragic canoeist Emma found out about the scare, while she was in Peru, she joked: ""Let's hope it's not a premonition."" After she was killed, her brothers Piers and Giles and sister Natasha paid tribute, saying: “Emma was an active and determined sister who challenged herself, latterly through her adventures on the Pacific Coast Trail, as well as in the South Pole and Amazon. “In a world that is today a much smaller place, the explorer in our sister found herself seeking ways to prove that challenges were achievable. “We are extremely proud of our sister who was dearly loved by us all and her strength will be sorely missed.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21323362/killer-murdered-brit-amazon-arrested-hospital/
RAGING camel ‘bites off owners HEAD’ before being beaten to death with sticks by furious villagers in India,"A CAMEL attacked and decapitated its owner before villagers beat the animal to death.  Sohanram Nayak had been trying to recapture his escapee camel when it allegedly bit off his head in Rajasthan, India on Monday.  Nayak was chasing after his desert animal that had broken free of its rope chains when it ferociously turned on him and threw him to the ground, The Times of India reported.  The raging camel then flung its owner by the neck before ""chewing his head"".  The furious victim's family and other local villagers got their revenge on the murderous camel later by capturing it, tying it to a tree and beating it to death with sticks.  A grim video of the locals killing the violent beast circulated widely on social media in India.  The brutal footage shows the dead camel slumped next to the tree and later pans to show the deceased body of its owner.   However, so far no complaints are reported to have been made about violent killing of the state animal.  In 2014, Rajasthan made camels the official State Animal in a bid to better protect them.  The northern Indian state's Camel Bill was introduced in 2015 as their population began to sharply decline in the area.  It banned the slaughter, trading or injury of camels.  The crime of killing the state animal carries with it a punishment of up to five years in jail.  ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21322910/camel-bites-off-owners-head-beaten-to-death/
Suella Braverman orders overhaul of anti-terror programme Prevent after it shows ‘cultural timidity’,"THE anti-terror programme Prevent will be overhauled — after the Home Secretary accused it of “cultural timidity” in the face of Islamist extremism. Suella Braverman yesterday said it must focus on public safety rather than “political correctness”. She told MPs about her plans as she accepted the 34 recommendations from a 188-page report by Sir William Shawcross which said the government scheme was “out of kilter” with Britain’s counter-terrorism system. Ms Braverman told MPs: “Prevent needs major reform.  ""Prevent needs to better understand the threats we face and the ideology underpinning them. “Eighty per cent of counter-terrorism police live investigations are Islamist. “MI5 are clear Islamist terrorism remains our predominant threat, accounting for 75 per cent of their caseload. “Yet only 16 per cent of Prevent referrals in 2021/22 were Islamist.  ""Prevent has shown cultural timidity and an institutional hesitancy to tackle Islamism for fear of the charge of Islamophobia.” The long-awaited Shawcross review was ordered by ex-Home Secretary Priti Patel in 2019 and calls for a better understanding of the threats the country faces. Several terror attacks have been carried out by extremists referred to the Prevent scheme, including Ali Harbi Ali, who murdered Tory MP Sir David Amess in 2021. Writing in The Sun today, Ms Braverman says she will also crack down on any taxpayers’ money being awarded to groups linked to radicalisation.

Firms actively target over-50s after 3.5million have quit working,"FIRMS are targeting over-50s after an exodus of older staff was blamed for shortages and high wages. Halfords, easyJet and McDonald’s have launched campaigns to encourage the “Great Unretirement” but to a mixed response so far. Airline easyJet said that its campaign featuring over-45s had seen cabin crew applications rise by 75 per cent. Director Michael Brown said: “We wanted more talented people looking for a career change later in life. “With part-time as well as full-time opportunities available, we can offer a career with flexibility that many think this job may not have.” However, bikes-to-garages business Halfords has taken on just one 68-year-old with only nine more applications pending after hundreds responded to its over-50s apprenticeship scheme. Last week the Bank of England highlighted that 3.5million workers between the aged 50 to 64 had stopped working — 300,000 more than two years ago. The biggest reason was long-term sickness, it said. The scale of inactivity is more pronounced in the UK than any other major economy, denting productivity and driving wage inflation. Some retired workers told The Sun they were encouraged to stop work by George Osborne’s pension freedom reforms in 2015, which let people cash in pots at 55. Age UK has also said many grandparents are now busy providing childcare. A rise in pandemic-related long-term sickness has led to 1.6million adults aged 50-plus unable to work, 20 per cent more than three years ago, according to over-50s platform Rest Less. Retailer John Lewis said: “Employers need to work with the Government to incentivise people of all ages and backgrounds into work.” HE might be married to a beautiful model, capped 42 times for England and the host of a top sports podcast but Peter Crouch has been ruled irrelevant to today’s youth. The Advertising Standards Authority yesterday agreed with bookie Paddy Power's defence of its Christmas ad that Peter Crouch did not “appeal to under-18s”. Following a complaint that Crouchy could have encouraged children into betting, Paddy Power argued that the 41-year-old was “not aspirational to under-18s in any way”.  The firm argued that since 2011 the former footballer had only played for “Stoke City or Burnley and all of his six appearances at Burnley were as a substitute”. It said that while Crouch was at Stoke the team was relegated from the Premier League.  He wasn’t on TikTok and his punditry for BT Sport only took place after the watershed. ELECTRICITY prices should be decoupled from the soaring cost of gas to accelerate the switch to electric vehicles, business groups have argued. As more of the UK’s energy supply comes from renewable sources such as wind and solar it no longer makes sense for electricity market prices to be set by expensive gas-fired power plants, experts argued. EV group FairCharge , the RAC and Octopus Energy said separating electricity from gas would mean home and business energy bills would be cheaper as well. The average cost of using public fast EV chargers increased by 50 per cent in the past year, making running a petrol car cheaper. Meanwhile the price of diesel has fallen below 170p a litre for the first time since March 2022, according to the RAC. FairCharge has also called for VAT at charge points to be reduced to the per cent levied on domestic electricity. PZ CUSSONS toasted an 18.8 per cent rise in sales after introducing 95p shower gels range Cussons Creations. The toiletries brand said sales soared to £336.9million in the past six months. Boss Jonathan Myers said it had not passed on all the costs it faced but a bottle of Imperial Leather shower gel rose from from £1 to £1.50. The firm is also expanding its recently acquired Childs Farm brand into Australia. BRITAIN’S biggest housebuilder Barratt Developments yesterday flagged green shoots in the market after “early signs” of demand. Last month Barratt warned there had been a “marked slowdown” in housebuyers as mortgage rates became more expensive and people held off waiting for prices to fall. The firm said sales had risen slightly since the end of last year. But boss David Thomas said: “We need to see continued momentum before we can be confident trading conditions are easing.” THE FTSE 100 hit an all-time high yesterday rising nearly one per cent to 7,934.30. Traders digested a report suggesting the UK could dodge a recession and signals that the US central bank would ease raising interest rates.  The index closed at 7,885.21. THE competition watchdog has said Microsoft's £57billion takeover of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard could weaken rivalry between Xbox and PlayStation. Microsoft announced the biggest ever deal in gaming a year ago.  But the Competition and Markets Authority said it could mean higher prices and fewer choices with less incentive for innovation. It suggested Microsoft could sell off the part of the business that manages Call of Duty. But experts said this would kill off the deal.

Graduate used Artificial Intelligence to cheat on exam — and still got a degree,"A GRADUATE used Artificial Intelligence to cheat on an exam — and still got a degree. Pieter Snepvangers, 22, got Microsoft’s controversial software ChatGPT to come up with a 2,000-word essay. He gave the result to a university lecturer to mark — who gave it a 2:2 pass. Londoner Pieter recently got a 2:1 in Politics and Social Policy from Bristol University — without cheating. But as an experiment he asked a lecturer from another establishment if he could take their final-year social policy assessment to see if he could spot if AI had written it. He started off by asking the software the essay question and requested 2,000 words. The software only managed to give back 365 words at first. So Pieter asked it ten separate questions and eventually got 3,500 words back. He then took the best paragraphs and copied and pasted them in an order that “resembled the structure of an essay”. Pieter said: “All in all, 20 minutes to produce an essay which is supposed to demonstrate 12 weeks of learning. Not bad. I nervously sent it off to my lecturer and awaited the verdict.” The lecturer said the essay used “good proper language” and he could have been convinced it was written by a lazy student. He also said “it wasn’t the most terrible in terms of content”. The lecturer added: “You definitely can’t cheat your way to a first class degree, but you can cheat your way to a 2:2” Pieter added: “ChatGPT is only three months old. You wouldn’t bet against it being able to write an essay worthy of a 2:1 in another three months.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/21322082/graduate-used-ai-chatgpt-cheat-exam/
"Tributes to amateur climber, 23, who fell 600ft to his death in Snowdonia in front of horrified friends","AN amateur climber who plunged 600ft to his death from a mountain has been described as a ""true gentleman"". Jack Carne, 23, was scaling the Gribin Ridge in Snowdonia, Wales, when the rock he was clinging onto broke away in his hand. He was climbing the rockface with two others after travelling more than 200 miles from his home in Yorkshire when he suddenly fell 600ft down the mountainside. His two pals were also injured and helped down the mountain by rescuers after the accident on Saturday. Friends have described Jack as the ""nicest lad you'll ever meet"" in heartbreaking tributes. His devastated girlfriend said on social media: ""Soulmates for ever and ever and ever."" A message on a GoFundMe page set up by Jack's pals reads: ""He will be missed by many.  ""He was never not smiling, he was there for everyone whenever anyone needed him! The funds will be used to help his family who are suffering so bad at the moment due to this tragedy. ""He will be missed by everyone he ever set eyes on."" Meanwhile, Jack's grandma thanked the rescue teams saying: ""A massive thank you to all involved risking your own lives to help my grandson and his friends, we are all heartbroken beyond words. ""You will be forever in my heart and thoughts Jack my beautiful grandson."" After Jack's tragic fall, a team of 12 rescuers searched for his body, which was found in the darkness shortly after 9pm on Saturday. Chris Lloyd, the chairman of the Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Organisation (OVMRO), said: ""He disappeared into the cloud below, falling a good distance down some very steep and nasty ground. ""His two colleagues saw him go so they tried to scramble to the edge to see where he had gone and climbed down quite a bit.  ""It was becoming really difficult ground and they called for him but there was no response. ""It is just a tragic accident and very, very unfortunate. The lads have not done anything wrong. This rock just came away in his hand. It is just so sad."" Mr Lloyd said the trio were ""well equipped"" for the climb. He added: ""They were three young men. They have done a lot of hillwalking together and had all the right kit. ""They were actually going to go and do some wild camping which is why they were so high so late."" An inquest into his death is expected to open later this month. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21324096/tributes-climber-fell-death-snowdonia/
My horse was kicked out of her posh stables because I work as a £5k a month OnlyFans model – it’s humiliating,"A RIDER and her horse were booted out of a posh stables — because she works as an OnlyFans model. Honour Spencer, 27, was given ten days to quit the high-end equestrian centre, which charged £630 a month to look after her horse Cherry. She was told in a message by a stables worker Ross Evans: “You are a lovely person.  ""However, unfortunately, we are not comfortable with the industry that you work in, which has been brought to my attention, and the different various people you have brought to the yard.” Honour, who makes £5,000 a month on the adult site, said: “It’s absolutely horrific — I’ve been discriminated against because of my job.” Honour moved 14-year-old Cherry into the Marbury Equestrian Centre, Cheshire, three days before Christmas. Mr Evans’ message giving her ten days’ notice arrived on New Year’s Eve. He offered her a full refund and help with transport to another stables. Honour replied saying she had done nothing wrong and had always been respectful to staff at the stables. She told him: “A person’s job doesn’t define a person’s personality. I am deeply hurt.” However, Mr Evans insisted the decision had been made by the yard’s business partners and managers. Honour has since moved Cherry to a different livery nearby, which has no problems with her job. The centre has been contacted for comment.

"We all screamed, but that’s not going to stop an earthquake, reveals mum-of-four hit by Turkey quakes","TRAUMATISED and hungry, a family of earthquake victims prepare for another freezing night sheltering under a plastic sheet — close to the ruins of what was their home. Trying to brew warming chai tea on a wood-burning stove, mum-of-four Muazzez Gezer recalled how she dragged her pyjama-clad children to the street. She said: “We were all asleep. Then the walls of our house began cleaving. “The shaking got faster and the children began to scream and cry. We all screamed — but that’s not going to stop an earthquake.” They escaped from their crumbling home as breeze blocks and roof tiles crashed down around them. With dozens of others from their poverty-blighted neighbourhood, they are now homeless in temperatures plunging as low as -5C. They live in Gaziantep, a city of two million people in southern Turkey, close to the epicentre of Monday’s first monster quake.  It was followed by another, and then hundreds of aftershocks. Another mum, 42-year-old Nazli Bulut Yas, told me: “We have no idea when the children will be back at school. But right now we just need bread and water to stay alive.” Around 300,000 people are believed to have displaced, while the official death toll in Turkey and neighbouring Syria yesterday climbed past 11,700. The toll is sure to rise further as wreckage is cleared. Yet hope still remains. Here in Gaziantep Ibrahim Karapirli, wife Pinar and their 18-month-old twins were pulled from the remains of a six-storey block of flats despite being entombed for 40 hours. In Haram, northern Syria, young siblings identified only as Mariam and Ilaaf were saved after 36 hours under the rubble, with Mariam bravely shielding her little brother’s head. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said rescue teams from 18 nations are now in the region. The frantic search for survivors has been joined by sniffer dogs brought to Turkey by a 77-strong UK squad.  London Fire Brigade Urban Search and Rescue responders in bright orange uniforms were seen with the animals combing through rubble in Antakya, southern Turkey. In Hatay Province, Abdulalim Muaini was wedged between the floor and a concrete slap for a heart-breaking 48 hours behind the body of his wife Esra. He was saved after reaching out a hand in the darkness when rescuers shone a torch into the wreckage.  He was eventually pulled free and treated by medics just feet away from where the bodies of daughters Mahsen and Besira lay wrapped in blankets. Syrian charity group the White Helmets miraculously pulled a family of four from a mass of tangled concrete and metal in the village of Bisnia, with crowds cheering as a little girl and her brother were taken to ambulances. However, there is growing anger and despair about the slow pace of rescue efforts in some areas. As freezing temperatures make finding survivors in ruined homes less likely, attention is turning the hundreds of thousands left hungry and sleeping in makeshift shelters. There were claims Turkey had failed to prepare for a quake “for 20 years” and had wasted the emergency funds. The country levied a so-called “earthquake tax” after a 1999 quake killed 17,000 people. The £3.8billion raised was supposed to be used to prevent future disasters and fund emergency response teams. But opposition parties accused Mr Erdogan of failing to use the tax properly — resulting to a sluggish response to the latest horror. Rival Kemal Kilicdaroglu claimed: “If there is one person responsible for this, it is Erdogan.” Mr Erdogan, who visited survivors for the first time yesterday, insisted the country’s 60,000 rescue workers would be better equipped. He said: “We had some problems in airports and roads but we are better today. We will be better tomorrow and later. We still have some issues with fuel but we will overcome those too.” Meanwhile it emerged ex-Newcastle winger Christian Atsu was still missing, despite previous reports he had been pulled from rubble and taken to hospital. Volkan Demirel, director at Atsu’s club Hatayspor, said: “There is no information on his whereabouts yet, we don’t know where he is. It’s not the case that he was pulled out or taken anywhere else.” It also emerged that in Syria survivors faced fresh horror two hours after disaster struck when ruthless President Bashar al-Assad’s forces shelled a badly damaged rebel-held area. Britain’s Foreign Secretary James Cleverly described the attack on Marea, 70 miles south of the quake’s epicentre, as “completely unacceptable”. MP Alicia Kearns, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, described it as a “truly callous and heinous attack”.

Nicola Bulley: My brother disappeared on same stretch of river exactly 45 years ago,"A MAN has revealed how his brother disappeared on the same stretch of river as missing mum Nicola Bulley exactly 45 years ago.  Roger Jones vanished into the icy Lancashire waterway on January 27, 1978.  The 16-year-old had been thrown into the water after a motorbike smash but his body wasn't found until two months later.  Roger's brother Don has now told of the eerie similarities between Nicola's and his youngest sibling's disappearances.  He recalled how police and rescuers poured hours into finding his brother and that tragically, in the end, his body washed up on a sandbank at low tide.  Don said Roger was found seven miles away from St Michael's on Wyre - the town Nicola was last seen.  He said the river conditions when Roger vanished were ""pretty similar"" to when the mum-of-two disappeared.  Don, who lives in Caton, Lancashire, told the Daily Star: “He was obviously swept over the weir and into the tidal part of the river. “It was just a case of waiting for what seemed inevitable."" Don said his heartbroken family were ""exhausted"" by the time Roger's body was found.   The teen was hurled into a brook that fed into the River Wyre - the waterway police believe Nicola slipped and fell into.  Roger, who was about to set off on his dream of being a farmer, had been riding passenger on a motorbike when it crashed into a car on a narrow bridge in Woodplumpton, near Preston. The horror unfolded on January 27, 1978 - exactly 45 years before Nicola disappeared. As people rushed to the aid of the driver, who was unconscious and fighting for his life, they were unaware another person had been on the bike.  It wasn't until hours later, at 3am, police rushed back to the bridge after being told Roger was missing.  A massive search and rescue operation was launched, seeing dog squads, specialist divers and police staff scattered around the waterway.  Don said watching the search for Nicola unfold sparked heartbreaking memories.  He said: ""We feel so much for Nicola's family and friends. We know just what they must be going through."" He was obviously swept over the weir and into the tidal part of the river. The Lancashire man said he felt for the family also having to deal with members of the public weighing in on the case online, which ""must be a nightmare"".  He added that his family had to put up with “clairvoyants and spiritualists” when Roger was missing, which “proved very upsetting, especially for our mum”. Earlier today a dive expert scouring the river in the search for Nicola said his team were ending their efforts. There has been no trace of the 45-year-old since 9.15am on January 27.  Dive expert Peter Faulding said they have done all they can to try to find the mum.  However, he said police are now honing their efforts into further downstream. It comes as police revealed there was a ""possibility"" the mum had actually left the river path on foot. They said one particular area was not covered by CCTV. This morning Nicola's distraught partner Paul Ansell visited the scene this morning. He spent 10 minutes walking the river bank near the bench where the mum's phone was found, still connected to a work Teams call.

"I’ve lost family in the Turkey earthquake & I’m going to help rescue others – they need our help, says Tamer Hassan","TAMER Hassan made a desperate appeal for help in the wake of the devastating earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria, as the death toll surpasses 12,000.  The British-Turkish actor, known for his starring role in The Football Factory, lost family in the quake and is now doing everything he can to help rescue teams and survivors.  The major 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Turkey and northern Syria early on Monday.  It was followed by another 7.5 earthquake and violent aftershocks and tremors that continued to devastate the region and hinder rescue teams. It is the biggest quake to hit the region in 84 years and is believed to have shifted Turkey by 10ft - becoming one of the deadliest earthquakes of this century.  ""I literally have no words for this. We're all devastated as I explained before we have family that are lost, not found,"" Hassan told Sky News. Currently in Cyprus, he is raising money for the relief effort and working to send over supplies before he joins rescuers in Turkey in the coming days.  ""The biggest distress for me is that there's some areas that have been completely flattened with no help,"" he explained. ""No one is there to help them"".  The World Health Organisation predicts 23 million people are affected by the disaster, with the death toll projected to reach 20,000 as more bodies are found. Hassan is also extremely fearful of the unfolding humanitarian disaster as many survivors are left without help, food, or anywhere to live.  ""People are freezing, people are starving,"" he said.  Hassan urged people to help. ""They need the world to come together to help them."" The film star also shared his fury at the Turkish government, who he believes aren't doing enough.  ""They need to step up,"" he said. ""People are left on their own to survive... they need hard, fast help.""  His criticism of Turkish President Erdogan's government comes as anger is growing fast across affected areas over the slow speed of rescue efforts.  Families are reportedly being forced to dig for their relatives without help across some of the most badly-hit areas.  Other factors are working to hamper rescue teams, including a lack of heavy machinery and shattered infrastructure preventing access to areas.  Twenty-five-year-old Yousseff has been waiting two days for news of his father, mother, brother, sister and son - all trapped among the ruins of his apartment building in Aleppo, Syria.  He has been listening to their frantic voices but emergency workers have not yet been able to reach them.  ""You can see here - they're very slow at work and they don't have enough equipment,"" he told Reuters.  Search and rescue operations continue through the night as volunteers scramble over the ruins of flattened buildings to find survivors - listening out for voices of those trapped.  Harrowing images show body bags piling up in cities across the stricken area, such as in Antakya, Turkey, where the dead were placed on the pavements as relatives raced to find their loved ones. Erdogan has declared a three-month state of emergency in the quake’s epicentre, Gaziantep, and nine other cities. Recent reports emerge of rescue teams being trapped within the rubble in the badly-struck city of Hatay, Turkey.  Other footage from the disaster shows heart-breaking scenes, including a father hanging onto his dead daughter's hand, whose body remains under the wreckage of their home. In a moment of hope, a new born baby was pulled from the rubble with her umbilical cord still attached. The mother, however, is believed to have died after giving birth while trapped for more than 24 hours.  The misery continues as news emerges that body bags are in short supply and aid workers are struggling to cope with the management of the bodies.  Syria, an already war-shattered country, faces compounding crises as aid agencies are exhaustingly stretched to deliver aid and help to millions across the nation embroiled in a civil war.  Generous Sun readers have already pledged over £300K to our ongoing Earthquake Appeal that will be donated to the British Red Cross.

Ex-Labour MP Jared O’Mara faces jail after being found guilty of fraud to fund cocaine habit,"SHAMED ex-Labour MP Jared O’Mara is facing jail for trying to fiddle his expenses to fund a spiralling cocaine habit. The 41-year-old was yesterday found guilty of fraud by false representation. O’Mara, who attended his trial by videolink, was ordered to court for sentencing today.  Judge Tom Bayliss KC told him: “I’ve permitted you until now to attend via video link.  ""I’m afraid that indulgence has now ceased.” O’Mara won the seat of Sheffield Hallam from former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Nick Clegg in 2017.  But within a year he had quit the Labour Party, remaining in office as an independent. Meanwhile, he was taking what was described in court as “prodigious quantities” of cocaine and was said to be in debt to drug dealers. So he cooked up a scheme to claim £24,000 in expenses between June and August 2019. Some were from made-up charity Confident About Autism. In a text to a pal he wrote of “bending the truth ever so slightly to both of our benefits”. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, set up following MPs expenses scandal, repeatedly rejected the invoices.  Police were tipped off and arrested him.  O’Mara, of Sheffield, who stood down as an MP in December 2019, was convicted of six fraud charges at Leeds crown court. He was cleared of two other charges. Co-defendant Gareth Arnold, of Dronfield, Derbys, was found guilty of three out of six fraud charges while John Woodliff, of Sheffield, was cleared. After the case, CPS boss Nick Price said: “O’Mara viewed taxpayers’ money as a source of income that was his to claim and use as he wished.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21323953/labour-jared-omara-jail-fraud/
President Zelensky pleads for more ­military support — saying he knows how Winston Churchill felt during WWII,"PRESIDENT Zelensky has pleaded for more ­military support — and said he knows how ­Winston Churchill felt during World War Two. He was on a clear mission to put more pressure on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, standing just yards away, to supply fighter jets in the face of Russian aggression.  His 20-minute lunchtime speech to MPs and peers was made in Parliament’s Westminster Hall — where the Queen lay in state last year.  Former Prime Ministers Liz Truss, Theresa May and Boris Johnson all stood in the vast hall as the sun beamed in through the stained-glass windows behind Mr Zelensky. The leader of war-torn Ukraine even symbolically presented Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle with a helmet from one of his pilots.  Inscribed on it were the words: “We have freedom. Give us wings to protect it.” Mr Zelensky, in his military fatigues, added: “I appeal to you and the world with simple and yet most important words: combat aircraft for Ukraine, wings for freedom.” He also referred to the monarch’s own air force training. To applause from a packed hall, he said: “In Britain, the king is an air force pilot and in Ukraine today, every air force pilot is a king.” Mr Zelensky also recalled a visit to the Churchill War Rooms in October 2020 where he said he now realises how the wartime PM felt.  He said: “A guide smiled and offered me to sit down on this armchair from which war orders had been given. “He asked me how did I feel, and I said that I certainly felt something. “But it is only now that I know what the feeling was. And all Ukrainians know it perfectly well too.  “It is the feeling of how bravery takes you through the most unimaginable hardships to finally reward you with victory.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21324704/president-zelensky-pleads-uk-more-military-support/
TV chef and Gordon Ramsay’s best man swindled out of £150K by couple working at his restaurant,"A TV chef was swindled out of £150,000 by a couple working at his restaurant, a court heard yesterday. Stephen Terry, 55, appeared on Great British Menu and was Gordon Ramsay’s best man. Office administrator Nicola Nightingale, 47 — responsible for paying wages and suppliers — persuaded him to let husband Simon, 50, do shifts helping with service. Mr Terry thought he was paid £10 an hour — but Mrs Nightingale allegedly transferred more than £46,000 to her husband between May 2018 and February 2020. Meanwhile the couple went on trips to Disney resorts in Europe and Florida and took anniversary trips to Morocco, Cardiff crown court heard — while making monthly payments to a debt management firm.  In March 2020, Mr Terry checked statements for The Hardwick in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, to find bogus invoices. He also found two £40,000 loans had been taken out in his name — and a £10,000 shortfall in the pension pot. Mrs Nightingale has pleaded guilty to fraud. Her husband, previously of Gilwern near Abergavenny, denies acquiring criminal property.  Trial continues. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21324300/tv-chef-conned-couple-restaurant/
Kim Jong-Un brings his daughter to work — to mark 75 years since North Korean army was founded,"NORTH Korean leader Kim Jong-Un brings his daughter to work — to mark 75 years since his country’s army was founded. Kim Ju Ae, believed to be nine or ten years old, helped him inspect troops in capital city Pyongyang.  Earlier she joined Jong Un, 39, and his wife Ri Sol Ju, 33, for a banquet with military officials. In November she joined her father at a test launch of a nuclear missile. The pair were pictured walking hand in hand inspecting the Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile before it was fired Kim is believed to have as many as three children, two girls and a boy, experts say. Michael Madden, a North Korea leadership expert at the US-based Stimson Centre, said at the time: ""This is the first observed occasion where we have seen Kim Jong-un's daughter at a public event. ""It is highly significant and represents a certain degree of comfort on Kim Jong-un's part that he would bring her out in public in such fashion."" Her unexpected appearance raised the prospect that leadership of the totalitarian state could pass to a fourth generation of Kims, and suggests that nuclear weapons will be part of that inheritance, analysts said. Mr Madden added: ""The nuclear weapons programme and Kim Jong-un’s accomplishments around them is a family legacy for whomever his successor is. ""So, what we are seeing, is Kim telecasting that fourth-generation hereditary succession is highly likely to happen. ""This is intended to communicate it to the wider North Korean elite as well as to foreign governments.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21324606/kim-jong-un-daughter-north-korean-army/
Kemi Badenoch signs historic UK-Italy export deal in Rome set to boost green tech and sciences by billions,"KEMI Badenoch has signed a historic UK-Italy export deal in Rome. The new Business and Trade Secretary hailed the first such post-partnership between the UK and any EU country, which will boost green tech and sciences by billions. It will slash red tape that prevent businesses from selling to Italy, and help make it easier for businesses to work there, adding to the £43billion in trade already done between the two nations. The UK's life sciences, carbon capture and other green tech sectors are to see a boom from the deal. Ms Badenoch said: “This partnership marks a significant milestone in the UK’s trading relationship with Europe and shows how an independent UK can benefit from striking ambitious trade deals with the world, while also reinforcing our already strong and prosperous trading relationship with EU members such as Italy. “This partnership will boost trade and investment between British and Italian businesses, ease the path for valuable investment, and will crucially grow UK exports as we aim for our target of selling £1 trillion of goods and services a year to the world by the end of the decade.""  She will fly out today to Mexico as Britain edges close to two deals there. Ministers are close to the final stages for the Indo-Pacific deal - dubbed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and are also in talks about a new bilateral UK-Mexico deal, which could cut the price of cars, telecoms and sound equipment.

Moment rampaging leopard with blood around its mouth snarls after mauling lawyers in courthouse attack,"THIS is the moment a bloodthirsty leopard snarls after breaking into a court and mauling several lawyers. Victims had to be rushed to hospital after the spotted beast terrorised the site in India for four hours before it was eventually caught. Shocking footage shows the leopard with blood around its mouth as it bares its teeth. Several men can also be seen fleeing the scene while dripping with blood after being savaged by the wild animal. Horrified witnesses said the leopard appeared out of nowhere and started prowling around the first floor of the Ghaziabad District court premises in Utter Pradesh on Wednesday Around 15 lawyers were working in the courthouse at the time. Frightened workers scrambled for cover while lawyers barricaded themselves into offices to keep safe from the roaming vicious predator. It is understood the beast attacked a police officer and at least four lawyers. One lawyer was pounced on by the leopard while trying to fend it off with a shovel and a stick. Meanwhile, a boot polisher shining shoes on the court premises was also savaged and had to be taken to hospital with serious injuries, according to local media. One witness said: “The leopard was first seen under the stairs in the CJM court building. “On seeing the people, the leopard ran from there. It pounced on the people and started running. “A constable, a lawyer, a shoe polisher, and several people were injured in the leopard attack.” Animal welfare officers were called to the courthouse to capture the wild beast. The 12-member team entered the building with nets and cages to catch the leopard. It is understood the officers managed to tranquilise the leopard and put it in a cage four hours after it entered the court. The attack comes after a wild leopard took a swipe at a van following a ferocious rampage through a city that saw 13 people injured. Local residents were rushed to hospital with serious injuries from the big cat attack in Jorhat, North East India, last month. The leopard mauled at least 13 people, which included a forest guard and a mother and her two daughters. The animal was captured and tranquillised after a two-day search.

Inside tragic downfall of lottery winner – who now steals trainers and narrowly avoided jail,"THIS is the tragic downfall of a lotto winner who once raked in a £100,000 jackpot but has now steals trainers and earns £300 a week. David Swatman, 43, was rolling in it after a mega scratch card win but now has to work as a part-time window fitter to make ends meet. Swatman, from Manchester, bagged the prize in 2018 and said he would use the money to follow his beloved football team Liverpool. At the time he told the Liverpool Echo: ""I’ve followed Liverpool all my life but because of my job, I often have to work weekends and can’t see them play as often as I would like to. ""Who knows, I could even get tickets to the Champions League final in Kiev if Liverpool make it there!"" The club did make it to the final, losing to Real Madrid 3-1. Now, however, he has narrowly avoided jail over a series of trainer thefts carried out when he work as a delivery driver for FootAsylum. The crook swiped boxes of expensive shoes while ferrying them between the companies North Wales depot and its Manchester base, Manchester Crown Court heard. Between August and September 2020, he nicked 22 boxes, each one containing items worth up to £1,000. The total value of the stolen goods came to £15,450. His crime was discovered when, in the course of a company investigation, CCTV revealed Swatman stopping at an unauthorised point to allow the boxes to be loaded into another vehicle. It came out that he had memorised an 'encryption lock' code for the vehicle, allowing him to complete the thefts. This isn't the shamed driver's first brush with the law, either. The court heard that he has 22 sets of previous convictions covering 44 offences. He admitted a single charge of theft covering all the items. In mitigation, Max Saffman pointed to the admission of guilt, as well as the fact that his client currently works part-time as a window fitter for just £300 a week. Swatman was handed a 20 month sentence, suspended for two years and ordered to carry out five days of rehabilitation and 150 hours of unpaid work. He was also slapped with £425 of prosecution costs. Sentencing him, His Honour Judge Field KC said: ""You used your privileged position to steal goods from your delivery vehicle for the benefit of others... It was a breach of the trust placed in you by your employers."" However, the judge said that Swatman had shown ""genuine remorse"" and ""taken steps to address the problems"" that led to him stealing. As such, he added: ""I have formed the strong view by what you have achieved over the last two-and-a-half years that there is a realistic prospect of rehabilitation in your case.""

Firefighters will NOT strike as they postpone action following increased pay offer,"STRIKES by firefighters have been postponed after an increased pay offer from employers, it was confirmed today.  The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it had been offered a seven per cent pay rise backdated to July 2022, followed by a five per cent bump from July this year. Members had voted to walk out after arguing their pay had been slashed by at least 12 per cent in real terms since 2010.  They warned of industrial action if a previous five per cent pay offer was not increased.  The union's executive decided to put the new offer to a ballot of its members, and has postponed the announcement of strike dates pending the outcome. The FBU said it will have an ""honest and sober"" discussion of the proposal, adding it still amounts to a pay cut given the rate of inflation. Matt Wrack, FBU general secretary, said: ""This offer is testament to the power of collective action through the FBU.  ""Last year we were offered an insulting two per cent. ""The employers have now revised their position. ""We have achieved this increase because of the massive vote in favour of strike action by firefighters and control staff across the country, which made clear the strength of feeling among firefighters about cuts to their wages."" He added: ""Since 2010, the average firefighter has lost at least 12 per cent of the value of their pay. ""We will now ballot our members. ""Frontline firefighters and control room staff will make the decision on whether this pay offer is considered a real improvement. ""Our internal discussions will be honest and sober. ""While the offer is improved from last year, it still amounts to a real-terms pay cut. ""Meanwhile, plans to announce a series of strike dates and industrial action will be postponed, pending the outcome of the ballot."" Firefighters were expected to strike for the first time since 2003 in the coming weeks.  Of the 73 per cent of union members who voted, 88 per cent were in favour of taking action.  It would have been one of many walkouts across the UK this month, as nurses, ambulance drivers, university staff and civil servants strike over pay and conditions.

Putin issues chilling threat of ‘military consequences’ if UK gives Ukraine jets after Zelensky’s barnstorming UK trip,"VLADIMIR Putin has vowed a “response” with “military-political consequences” if the UK supplies Ukraine with fighter jets. The tyrant’s sabre rattling comes after Volodymyr Zelensky made a passionate plea for warplanes to Parliament on a surprise barnstorming visit to the UK. Rishi Sunak has said “nothing is off the table” after the Ukrainian leader invoked the spirit of Winston Churchill in his address. A furious Russia hit back with a chilling warning, in a statement issued through its UK embassy. The “military-political consequences” of what arming Ukraine “will be on the United Kingdom’s hands”. “Russia will know how to respond to any unfriendly actions by the British side,” it said. Russia also took a swipe at Zelensky calling him “pompous” and “hypocritical”. His plea for weapons comes amid mounting concern Russia is planning a renewed offensive. Russia has amassed a huge arsenal 1,800 tanks, 3,950 armoured vehicles, 2,700 artillery systems, 810 multiple-rocket-launch systems, 400 fighter jets, and 300 helicopters, reports Foreign Policy. ""Russia has also begun arming up and digging in for a coming offensive,” it quoted an Ukrainian official as saying. The Ukrainian leader’s plea came in a 20-minute lunchtime speech to MPs and peers in Parliament’s Westminster Hall. Former Prime Ministers Liz Truss, Theresa May and Boris Johnson all stood in the vast hall as the sun beamed in through the stained-glass windows behind Mr Zelensky. The leader of war-torn Ukraine even symbolically presented Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle with a helmet from one of his pilots. Inscribed on it were the words: “We have freedom.

He said: “A guide smiled and offered me to sit down on this armchair from which war orders had been given.” The PM has now ordered the Defence Secretary Ben Wallace to examine ways that the UK can provide Ukraine with fighter jets. The RAF has a limited number of aircraft it could theoretically provide Ukraine, including about 20 older Typhoon jets. In response, Downing Street said Mr Wallace is investigating what aircraft the UK could potentially offer But it emphasised this was ""a long-term solution"" and that training pilots could take years.

Heartbreaking moment little girl protects brother while stuck under rubble before they’re saved after Turkey earthquake,"TWO children were saved from the rubble after being trapped for 36 hours after two deadly earthquakes struck their home in Syria.  The seven-year-old girl, Miriam, desperately clung to her younger brother as she begged the rescue worker to ""get us out of here"".    The massive 7.8 magnitude quake stuck early on Monday with such force that it moved the country 10ft and has now killed 15,000 people. Two further earthquakes struck in the 24 hours after the initial tremor, leaving a trail of destruction stretching for hundreds of miles along Turkey’s border with Syria. The brave siblings were found trapped beneath slabs of concrete - the ruins of their home in Besnaya-Bseineh near Haram in Syria. The devastating footage shows Miriam protecting her brother's head and staring wide-eyed and exhausted at the rescue worker. She says: ""Sir, if you rescue me and my brother, I'll do whatever you want."" ""But get us out of here.""  Both young children were thankfully rescued and later pictured safe.  The entire family - father, mother and three children - were all sleeping when the deadly 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck early Monday morning.  Miraculously, the entire family was saved from the rubble - a positive story among the many thousands of other families shattered by the disaster.  It comes as generous Sun readers pledge more than £300,000 to aid rescue efforts. The appeal is being backed by reality star Ekin-Su Culculoglu. The Love Island winner, 28, whose parents are Turkish, has family caught up in Monday’s disaster. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has declared a three-month state of emergency in quake epicentre, Gaziantep, and nine other cities. Desperate searches are taking place to find survivors buried underneath the rubble of the thousands of buildings destroyed. Harrowing images show body bags laid out on the road and it's feared the death toll could eventually reach 20,000. Meanwhile survivors are preparing for another freezing night sheltering under a plastic sheet — close to the ruins of what was their home.

Who is criminologist David Wilson?,"DAVID Wilson has devoted his life to stepping into the minds of evil murderers. Now a criminologist, the professor was once a prison governor at the jail serial killer Dennis Nilsen was caged in. Born in Scotland on April 23, 1957, David Wilson is a former prison governor. As of 2023 he continues to work as a professor of criminology at Birmingham City University.  He works to explain criminal behaviour by analysing a host of areas (like economics) that have an impact on a crime. David has also become a familiar face on TV, and is known for hosting crime documentaries. He famously fronted Channel 4 docuseries In the Footsteps of Killers alongside Silent Witness star Emilia Fox. The three-part documentary looks at three, real-life unsolved murder cases. Other TV work incudes hosting The Crime Squad for BBC One, and also Too Young to Die?, which was about the plight of young people on death row in the USA.  Over on BBC Two David presented Who Killed Ivan the Terrible?. His work on Channel 5 includes presenting Banged Up, which was nominated for a Royal Television Society award. Serial killer David Nilsen admitted killing at least 15 people but ultimately was convicted of the murders of six men and two attempted murders.  He was sentenced to life imprisonment on November 4, 1983. The killer died in York Hospital in 2018, aged 72, after collapsing in his prison cell. While working as a prison governor, David got transferred to HM Prison Brixton, where he met Nilsen, who was serving his sentence their at the time. David spoke to Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield on This Morning about his encounters with serial killer Nilsen. He said: ""I was literally 23 years old when he first met me and came into my cell and I was a doctor of philosophy, I was in the age group of his victims. ""At a later date I interviewed him about another matter and when I finished the interview he leaned over the desk and said 'Do you have to go?' ""He knew I knew those were his last words before he killed his first victim."" After sharing this chilling comment, he admitted that he thought Nilsen ""fancied"" him. He also said that the killer would ""toy with him"". David thinks that Nilsen came across like ""a weedy geography teacher"" in person. Explaining how he thought he was definitely sane, he said: ""There was no evidence of mental illness, he was interested in power and control and the ultimate form of expressing that was through taking other people’s lives.""

Warning for shoppers as just days left to spend vouchers before major high street shop closes for good,"PAPERCHASE shoppers have just days left to spend their vouchers before they expire.  The stationery retailer collapsed early this month into administration after it failed to find a buyer. Supermarket giant Tesco quickly stepped up to buy rights to the brand as they plan to sell Paperchase items in stores. However, Paperchase's 106 high street stores launched closing down sales, though it hasn't been confirmed that they'll definitely close for good. But shoppers who still have Paperchase vouchers must spend them now before they become invalid. The vouchers can be used up until Tuesday February 14 - after that they'll expire.  So use yours as soon as possible so you don't miss out.  In addition, any rewards on the Paperchase loyalty card must also be spent by February 14.  Vouchers and gift cards can no longer be bought online or in-store. You can check the balance of vouchers and loyalty cards online and in-store. Last week, shoppers were rushing to buy bargains from Paperchase as the retailer looks set to ""disappear from the high street"". Paperchase fans took to social media after spotting discounted items on sale in store. One Twitter user said: ""Paperchase has gone into administration and it looks like they’ve got a sale on in store. ""I know where I’m going after work."" The retailer is also running a sale online with almost 20% off everything online. The Sun previously revealed that administrators were planning to liquidate the business, closing all of the 106 stores and putting 1,000 jobs at risk. When a business is liquidated, they will look to sell stock for as much as possible to pay back creditors. Stores may disappear off the high street within weeks but the process could take up to two months. You can see the full list of Paperchase stores here.  The company opened its first store in 1968 in Kensington, London. In 2010, it launched its website and its first standalone store in Ireland in Dundrum, Dublin, in 2020. From the Scottish clothing brand M&Co to wellies store Joules, a number of familiar brands went bust in 2022. Here, The Sun has put together a full list of retailers that closed last year. Major burger chain Byron Burger also recently fell into administration and is set to close nine restaurants immediately. Further popular chains including Las Iguanas, Cafe Rouge and Bella Italia also fell victim to the pandemic. In December 2022, pub chain Wetherspoons announced it would be closing a total of 39 pubs after being hit by soaring inflation. When a company goes into administration, the people appointed to manage the process can decide whether to allow the use of gift cards or not. It means you'll need to keep an eye on the administration process to see what your rights are. The administrators are allowed to stop accepting gift cards at any point - and in this case it'll be next week ( February 14). If the administrators later decide that you can't use your vouchers, you should register a claim with the administrators for the value of the vouchers. This also applies if the company can't be saved through administration and is later liquidated. However, you may not get this money back if other creditors are owed money too. You may also only get a portion of the money back. If the voucher or amount put on a gift card was for more than £100, then it may be possible to claim the money back if it was purchased with a credit card. This is because the card company is jointly liable under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. If the voucher was a gift, then you'd need to ask the person who bought it for you to claim the money back. Do you have a money problem that needs sorting?

"Four money saving challenges helped us buy £250,000 first home – here’s how you can too","DITCHING subscriptions and binning takeaways helped Alexa and Jordan Wilson save the £12,500 needed for their first home. Savings challenges helped them save £1,000 a month to put down a deposit on their £250,000 first home. Jordan, 29, and Alexa, 26, had been renting for eight years, but  two years ago they decided it was time to get their own place to raise their six-year-old son Oscar. Like many other first time buyers, the couple needed to cut back on spending to help save up cash for a deposit. Putting in place savings challenges helped Jordan, who works for an engineering company, and Alexa, an early years educator, do this. They did this by cutting back on takeaways and by stopping eating out, saving around £300 a month. The pair also cancelled their subscriptions to Netflix and Now TV, as well as switching to a SIM-only phone plans - saving around £90 a month. After they got married in February 2022, the pair had £1,500 left from their wedding budget and £3,500 in monetary wedding gifts that they were able to put towards their deposit. They bought their property using the government's Help to Buy Scheme. The government scheme gives budding buyers an equity loan and allows them to put down a deposit of just 5%. You can get up to 20% off the value of your property - or 40% if you live in London - under the scheme. The loan is interest-free for the first five years - but bad news for any budding buyers, the scheme has now closed. But there are other schemes available that will give you a helping hand up the property ladder. The Help to Build scheme offers an equity loan to help you build a home or convert a previously commercial building. Through the scheme, the government offers you a loan based on the estimated costs to buy a plot of land and build a home or buy a building to convert into a home. The First Homes scheme was launched last year and means prospective first-time buyers in England can get homes at a 30% to 50% discounted rate compared to market price. But, if the homeowner decides to sell the property down the line, the discount on the new value will be made available to any future buyer too. Jordan and Alexa got the keys to their home in September 2022.  We sat down with Jordan to see how they went from being a saver to a homeowner for The Sun’s My First Home series. It's a four-bedroom, detached house in Louth, Lincolnshire. The property is a new-build with an open-plan kitchen and dining room leading to the back garden. The garden is perfect and really handy for our bulldog, Nala. Upstairs, we have a family bathroom, a master bedroom with an ensuite and two further rooms. We also have a front garden and a driveway. We knew we wanted a new-build property after years of renting a fairly old house.  Our rental home was a three bedroom, semi-detached house, but it was a lot smaller than where we are now and only had one toilet. It was also in the middle of a town. We had also previously lived in a rural cottage, so we wanted somewhere that was the best of both worlds and I feel like we have that. It's far enough out of town to enjoy the peace and quiet, but still within reasonable reach of the shops and the community. Our house was £250,000 and we put down a 5% deposit of £12,500.  We took out a mortgage of £187,000 for 30-years with a fixed-rate of 3.9% for five-years. We also applied for a Help to Buy equity loan. It's a scheme that helps first-time buyers get on the property ladder with just a 5% deposit, even if they borrow enough for a mortgage. The government will loan up to 40% of the value of the property if you live in London, or 20% outside of the capital. We received a £50,000 loan from the government as part of the scheme. Our mortgage repayments are around £900 a month.  We really started to save hard from 2019, then Covid hit in 2020 and we had to postpone our wedding. While this was disappointing, it did mean that we had more time to save. It wasn't in our plan to buy a home so soon, but we found that  the pandemic restrictions meant we could put away more cash and save for the wedding and a home at the same time. Alexa and I both set up a standing order so that £500 would go out of our accounts and into a savings account at the start of each month. We save around £200 a month by cutting out meals out and drinks with friends over lockdown. We also cut down our weekly takeaways to monthly, saving us around £100 a month. Cancelling our Netflix and Now TV subscriptions meant that we had an extra £30 in our pocket at the end of the month. We also decided not to renew our phone contracts in order to save money.  Both of us were spending around £60 a month on our phone bill, but we reduced this by £45 each by switching to SIM only deals. If I had anything left in my account before pay day, I would it over to my savings account.  This wouldn't happen every month, but it could vary between an extra £50 and £250 going into our savings. After our wedding in January 2022, we had around £1,500 leftover from the budget, so this went towards out deposit.  We were also lucky enough to get a total of £3,500 in monetary wedding gifts from friends and family which also went towards the house. We had a lot of relatively new furniture from our previous rental property that we had accumulated over the years. It meant we didn't have to fork out a big chunk of cash for furniture when we moved into our new home.  We have decided that if we do want new furniture in the future, we will buy things in stages to spread out the cost. We knew we wanted to do be homeowners, so we set our minds to it and we got there in the end.  You just have to be 100% dedicated to it, and don't give up. One couple used the snowball method to clear their £26,000 debt and buy their first home. Here's how one homeowner saved half their wages while renting to buy their £315,000 first home.

"Two thirds of small businesses are prioritising their energy usage, study finds","Two thirds of small business owners have adopted more cost saving working practices over the last 12 months to reduce their energy usage. The study of 500 adults who are either small business owners or decision-makers, found they have made an average of six tweaks to save energy. Exactly a third have encouraged staff to adopt more energy-friendly behaviours, 20 per cent have gone ‘paper free’ and 29 per cent have turned down the temperature on their boiler. A quarter (26 per cent) have turned off radiators in some rooms, while 24 per cent have lowered their thermostat. Banning printing, encouraging working from home, where possible, and only running the dishwasher when it was full were also popular ways of reducing energy costs. Energy-efficient lightbulbs are now the norm for 32 per cent, as is not overboiling the kettle (24 per cent). Furthermore, 19 per cent are reducing their opening hours and 33 per cent are ‘very likely’ to consider actively moving premises. The research was commissioned by Smart Energy GB, whose director Victoria Bacon said: “As business owners continue to reduce their energy usage wherever possible, actions such as changing to LED lightbulbs and turning off the lights when rooms are not being used are now increasingly commonplace. “As is encouraging staff to adopt more energy saving behaviours.” The research went on to find how new tech has helped firms with their day-to-day administrative tasks, with 89 per cent of respondents agreeing that investing in new technology has been an effective way of reducing daily costs in the long run. This includes email marketing and social media promotion, as well as using more software for accounting and procurement purposes. Nearly a third (32 per cent) now consider energy efficiency credentials more than ever when upgrading equipment, with 51 per cent also buying more ‘smart’ appliances. Almost  three in ten (29 per cent) check their energy usage at least once a day, with just under a third (32 per cent) checking several times each week. Of those surveyed, 58 per cent admit they’re still not sure of the most efficient ways to cut costs in their business, with 35 per cent saying there isn’t enough information available. Nearly four in 10 (39 per cent) use so much equipment that it’s hard to keep track of energy use, while 34 per cent can’t afford to upgrade their gear. Nearly three quarters (72 per cent) fear that if they were to cut back on costs much further, their business simply wouldn’t function as usual. And for 73 per cent, 2022 was the only year so far they had to really consider cutting costs at their workplace. Yet 78 per cent say it is a bonus that a lot of their energy saving measures are having a positive effect on the environment. With 65 per cent saying that reducing their company’s carbon footprint is either more important, or at least equally important, as reducing costs, according to the research by OnePoll. Victoria Bacon from Smart Energy GB added: “We know from our research how hard small businesses are working to keep their finances under control. “A smart meter measures energy usage in near-real time, providing accurate bills. ""This means businesses only pay for the energy they actually use, which can help business owners to manage their cashflow and budgets.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/21326269/two-thirds-of-small-businesses-prioritising-energy-usage/
Major supermarket is giving drivers 5p a litre fuel discount – how to get it,"A MAJOR supermarket is giving drivers 5p off a litre of fuel - here's how to get it. Morrisons has announced that from today, February 9, shoppers will be able to get the discount at the pumps. The offer will run throughout half term and end on Sunday, February 19. Customers will be given a voucher to redeem when the fill up after shopping at the supermarket. But customers will need to spend £35 or more in-store to claim the 5p a litre money off coupon. The vouchers will be redeemable at all 339 Morrisons petrol stations across the UK. But there are a handful of items that are excluded from the officer: The coupons will also not be valid at franchised Morrisons Daily petrol stations. Morrisons has listed its full terms and conditions on its website. And remember, the exact amount that Morrisons charges for its fuel will vary by location so do check yours before you fill up. You can find your nearest filling station by using the locator tool on its website. Rachel Eyre, chief customer & marketing officer at Morrisons, said: ""This fuel promotion, together with more than a thousand prices that we cut and held down in January, will make a difference to our customers' household bills. ""We know that fuel is a big expense and so our fuel offer aims to help budgets go a little further."" According to the latest PetrolPrices figures, the average price of petrol was 154.1p last week, and for diesel, it was 177.7p. The price of unleaded petrol peaked at a record high of 191.53p in July 2022 and has slowly fallen back down. Meanwhile, diesel is down from 199.07p in July 2022. But these are average prices and what you pay depends on the station you head to. It's not the first time Morrisons has offered customers money off their fuel for spending cash in-store. The move comes as the RAC had previously called on supermarkets to pass falling petrol prices onto consumers. The easiest way to find the cheapest forecourt in your area for fuel is by using price comparison sites. Websites like Petrolprices.com will list the cheapest filling stations in your area. You need to register with the site, enter your postcode and tell it how far you're willing to travel for fuel (up to 20 miles) and what fuel type you're after. There are other websites you can use too. Fleet News and Allstar also let you check petrol prices across the counties so you can see how your region compares to the UK average. Comparison website Confused.com also has a petrol prices checker that lets registered users find petrol prices within a five, ten or 25 mile radius. Petrolprices.com is useful, but it does only give you limited amounts of searches each day, whereas Confused.com doesn't.

Sky to make massive change for millions of customers – and people will be fuming,"MILLIONS of Sky customers will see their bills rise by an average of £67 a year this year. The increase will affect all Sky broadband and some Sky TV customers.  The increase will come in from April, so if you pay your bill on the 10th of every month, you'll be charged the extra amount from April 10.  Customers will see an average increase of £5.60 a month, which works out as £67.20 a year. Though, of course, this will vary depending on your package. All broadband customers will see a hike, but it's slightly different for TV customers.  It depends on where you are in your contract and what package you're on. The telecoms giant said the average increase is across Sky TV packages including Q, Glass and Stream. However, Sky Glass and Stream TV package customers will only see an increase if they took out a contract before October 18, 2022. Sky broadband customers unhappy with the hike will be able to leave up to 30 days before the change penalty-free. Sky TV customers cannot leave penalty-free if they are still in their minimum contract term.  Affected customers will be contacted from February 16 so keep an eye out for an email or letter from the provider.  Customers will then be able to see the change on their Sky account two weeks before their increased bill will come out.  Many broadband and mobile phone providers base their annual price increases on the rate of inflation plus an extra 3.9%. However, Sky said it is not basing its hike on inflation, instead, customers will see an average increase of 8.1% a year.   Sky recently upped its prices for 1.3million mobile customers too.  From February 14, bills for Sky's out of contract customers will increase by £1 a month, or an average of 9%. This means that if you pay your phone bill on the 20th of every month, you'll pay the extra amount from February 20. Those still in contract will not be affected. A Sky spokesperson said: ""This is not a decision we have taken lightly.  ""We have tried to minimise the impact to customers with an average price increase across all our broadband and TV customers of 8.1%, which is below levels of inflation again this year – competitors’ average increase over the last two years has been nearly double Sky’s average increase over the same period."" Sky isn't the only provider to hike its prices recently.  Virgin Media was writing to customers from January to tell them their bills would go up by an average of £50 a year.  Impacted customers will see their bills increase from either April 1 or May 1 but Virgin will confirm which date yours will change in an email. But if you're not happy with the increase, you will have 30 days from receiving the notification from Virgin to cancel penalty-free. On average, Virgin Media cable customers will be hit with an average price increase of 13.8% - though this will be higher or lower depending on packages. BT, EE and Three are among the firms which also confirmed to The Sun they will put up bills by up to 14.4%. BT said that ""the majority"" of its BT, EE and Plusnet customers will see a rise in their monthly bills from March 31. Your internet provider or mobile network should contact you to let you know how much your bills will increase in April. There's also an easy way to work out how much more you're set to pay. Just find out what percentage increase of your current monthly bill is - you can use an online percentage calculator to work that out. Then add those two figures together - this will give you your new monthly payment. To find out your annual cost, times that total figure by 12. If you think your bills are too high and want to pay less, the first thing to do is find out what the cheapest deal on the market is. You can use this rate as a bargaining tool to get a better offer from your provider. Get in contact with your provider to see if they can match this rate - if not, you might want to switch instead. If you're mid-contract though and wish to leave, bear in mind that you could face an exit fee so check with your provider for any charges. Plus, it could be harder haggling with these prices as they come most years from all providers. For more ways to cut your phone bill, we've got eight tips for slashing costs.

Martin Lewis warns 1.7million households could be plunged into poverty ahead of Budget,"MARTIN Lewis has warned millions of households could be plunged into poverty ahead of the Budget.  The MoneysavingExpert.com (MSE) founder has written to the Chancellor to call for April’s planned energy rise to be scrapped. The average bill is expected to rise from £2,500 to £3,000 but Martin said that is no longer necessary as wholesale prices have “come down very substantially”. The money expert said the planned cuts must be postponed. He said: “It just seems to me there is no need to do this.  ""If we postpone this rise it is likely from July, wholesale prices will have gotten to the price cap and if the energy price cap which is set by the regulator and is dictated by wholesale prices, is lower than the energy price guarantee we pay the lower amount, and that is likely to happen from July."" Martin said: “To put this national act of harm of increasing the price guarantee for just three months, to throw another 1.7million people into fuel poverty taking it to 8.4 million, it seems unnecessary.” He said any cancellation would have to happen before the March Budget because by then people will have had letters telling them their bills are going up. The letter, which was sent on Thursday morning, is supported by charities including Citizens Advice, National Energy Action and StepChange. The average household's energy bills might hit around £2,200 a year from July. This is £300 less than previously thought, experts at Cornwall Insight said. It is around the same as an average family pays today after the Government support has been factored in. Without backing from the Government the average household would pay £4,279 per year for their energy bills between January and April – the level of the Ofgem price cap. But the Government has overridden the price cap with a promise to pick up the difference and ensure that average bills are £2,500. It has also been sending £400 to every household in the country between October and March. From April the support gets less generous and will only reduce average bills to £3,000. As part of the Autumn Statement, it was revealed millions on benefits and Universal Credit will receive an extra one-off £900. Eight million households have already received cost-of-living payments worth up to £650. Pensioners have also started getting a £300 one-off payment. The current pensioner cost of living payment is being handed out to millions on a low income. You qualify under the current rules if you normally get the winter fuel payment, but this could change under the new rules. The £300 cost of living payment is paid on top of the other winter support. Struggling families are eligible for the Warm House Discount to help them tackle the cost of living. There are also plenty of energy grants and schemes open to help you out if you're struggling: There's also a one-off fuel voucher from your energy supplier if you're on a prepayment meter.

Heartbreaking Nicola Bulley update as dive expert says why he fears she may ‘never’ be found after pulling out of search,"A DIVE expert involved in the search for missing mum Nicola Bulley has issued a heartbreaking update in the case. Peter Faulding said that Nicola is not in the river near where she went missing and ""may never be found"". He said: ""She may never be found. We don't know. No one knows. It is unusual because usually you have some evidence. ""Here we have nothing. We have nothing to go on apart from a phone and a [dog] harness."" Mr Faulding reportedly told Nicola's partner Paul Ansell of his findings yesterday as they visited the site where she is believed to have gone missing. The underwater specialist was called in to assist police divers, who have been searching the area since the mum-of-two's disappearance almost two weeks ago. However, he confirmed that his team will not continue with the search as cops focus their search downstream towards the sea. He added that he had been ""determined"" to find Nicola, but that both he and Mr Ansell were ""relieved"" that he hadn't. She may never be found."" Members of the public have joined the search effort, but Lancashire Police have warned amateur sleuths not to ""take the law into their own hands"". Superintendent Sally Riley said: ""It is not helpful if people, particularly if they come from outside the area, take it upon themselves to take the law into their own hands. ""We will not tolerate online abuse of anyone, including innocent witnesses, members of the family and friends, of local businesses, or of criminal damage or burglary."" Nicola Bulley vanished while walking near St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, on January 27. Cops believe that she fell into the river as she walked her springer spaniel Willow. At the time of her disappearance, she was wearing a long black gilet jacket with a hood and had her hair tied in a ponytail. She had black jeans on with olive green ankle wellies. Nicola's phone and the dog's lead were found on a bench nearby. She was last seen at 9.10am that morning. Supt Riley confirmed there is a ten minute window where they cannot account for Nicola's movements, amid fears she left the path in a CCTV blackspot. This is between the last confirmed sighting at 9.10am, and 9.20am when Nicola's phone was connected to a work call on the bench.

"Russia ‘massing 1,800 tanks, 700 aircraft & 500k men for new Ukraine assault in 10 DAYS’ after Zelensky begs UK for jets","RUSSIA has hundreds of thousands of soldiers, thousands of tanks, and hundreds of warplanes preparing for a new assault, Ukraine has warned.  Vladimir Putin is believed to be preparing for a massive new offensive in the coming weeks to coincide with the first anniversary of the war in February 24. Ukraine has been monitoring the military build up as they continue to plea for Western support - including during Volodymyr Zelensky's visit yesterday to London.  Zelensky hailed the UK for its support - but warned it may be enough, and called for modern fighter planes.  The new assault is feared to be ""much bigger"" than the first wave which stormed across the country towards Kyiv almost exactly one year ago.  Russia is believed to be massing 1,800 tanks, 3,950 armoured vehicles, 400 fighter jets and 300 helicopters for the attack, according to a Ukrainian official. They added Putin is also gathering 2,700 artillery guns and 810 rocket launchers for a ""new wave of attacks"", reports Foreign Policy.  ""It’s much bigger than what took place in the first wave,"" the official said. ""They are not paying attention to any casualties or losses. In the next 10 days, we expect a new, huge invasion."" Ukrainian intelligence has put the figure for the spring offensive at between 300,000 and 500,000 soldiers.  Russia is believed to have approximately 300,000 troops already operating in Ukraine. And it's believed another 200,000 men from the recent mobilisations will be called up to fight in the offensive.  Pentagon officials however have said new Russian troops are ""ill-equipped, ill-trained""  and they have been ""rushed"" towards the frontline.  Kyiv fears Putin could also stage a new round of mobilisation to further bolster his forces for the assault.  Western analysts and Ukrainian officials have been warning for weeks about a brewing offensive in the country's East. Andriy Chernyak, an official in Ukraine’s military intelligence, told the Kyiv Post: ""We’ve observed that the Russian occupation forces are redeploying additional assault groups, units, weapons and military equipment. ""According to the military intelligence of Ukraine, Putin gave the order to seize all of the territories of Donetsk and Luhansk regions by March."" Fighting in recent weeks has been centred around Bakhmut - which has been described as the ""bloodiest"" battle of the war so far, with frontline soldiers have a life expectancy of just 4 hours. Vlad's initial assault last February saw his forces storm towards Kyiv before they were sent back by the Ukrainians. Ukraine then went on the counteroffensive, liberating huge swathes of the country from the disorganised Russians. The conflict then slowed down over the winter. And in recent weeks it has been reported the Russians were beginning to make gains. The UK Ministry of Defence has said conditions are likely to be extremely muddy in March as temperatures warm - so both sides may seek to avoid major offensives. But the MoD warned that perceived ""political or operational opportunities"" may override this - such as in Russia's invasion last February.  President Zelensky gave a rousing, historic speech yesterday as he visited the UK for the first time since the war - invoking the spirit of Winston Churchill.  ""Do you have a feeling that the evil will crumble once again. I can see in your eyes now, we think the same way as you do. We know freedom will win. We know Russia will lose,"" said Zelensky. And we really know that the victory will change the world and this will be a change that the world has long needed. ""The United Kingdom is marching with us towards the most, I think, the most important victory of our lifetime. It will be a victory over the very idea of the war. ""After we win together, any aggressor, it doesn't matter big or small, will know what awaits him if he attacks international order. ""Any aggressor who will try to push the boundaries by force who will inflict destruction and death on other peoples, who will try to endure his dictatorship at the expense of other people's blood in criminal and unprovoked wars as the Kremlin does. ""Any aggressor is going to lose."" Putin will likely be seeking some sort of major triumph or new operation to mark the anniversary - with his future now tied to the success or failure of the war. According to Ukraine, more than 135,000 Russians are lying dead in the war's muddy battlefields. The war has seen Vlad's forces thrown back and any hopes of a quick victory have sunk to the bottom of the Black Sea. But despite staggering losses - the Russian army is understood to be more than one million men strong, with another two million reservists who could called up. And Putin's defence boss Sergei Shoigu has announced plans to swell the number of active personnel to one and a half million from 2023.

Full list of Wetherspoons price increases – how much more will you pay?,"PRICE hikes have hit the popular pub chain Wetherspoons and customers will now pay more for their beer and bites. Prices have gone up by 7.5 per cent - adding up to 29p for a pint and 75p on food. The Sun revealed the price increases after visiting the Wetherspoons at the Oxted Inn branch in Surrey.  However, just note that pub prices will likely vary across the country. Among the price differences were favourite tipples up by seven per cent, with a pint of Carlsberg up from £2.39 to £2.57, Stella from £3.35 to £3.60 and Leffe from £3.85 to £4.14. Popular meal deals have also increased. A large breakfast has risen from £5.90 to £6.34 while a cup of tea or coffee rose from £1.35 to £1.45. Deli deals will also set you back as they have risen from £4.29 to £4.90. Prices for small plates have also increased like the Chicken Breast Bites originally £4.10 increased up to £5.40. The 10-piece chicken wings rose from £4.80 to £5.99. The surges shouldn't be too shocking as the popular chain hinted at price hikes during its January trading update to investors.  Plus, it’s the second time in less than a year that prices have risen. In November, it increased costs in 15 central London pubs - which was said to be a direct result of inflation.  A Wetherspoon spokesman said: “Most businesses in the hospitality industry have had to deal with big price increases in the past year or two. “We have tried to keep our prices competitive, bearing in mind that customers have suffered from inflation too."" The price spikes come after the chain recently closed 10 pubs and put even more up for sale. Among these, the Edmund Halley branch in Lewisham, London, and The Postal Order in Worcester closed last year, while the Willow Grove in Southport is set to shutter no later than April. Some of the 39 pubs currently up for sale are Durham – Water House, Bournemouth – Christopher Creeke, Halifax – Percy Shaw, and West Bromwich – Billiard Hall.

Major DIY store closing multiple locations within weeks – full list of shops affected,"B&Q will close eight ""mini-shops"" located inside Asda supermarkets for good within weeks. Stores will start to close from March 11 across the country. B&Q's eight locations set to shut are: The DIY retailer will look to launch smaller stores along the high street instead. Asda said it was considering different options about what to do with the free space. B&Q's 57 staff affected by the shake-up will be offered alternative roles in nearby stores. The store teamed up with Asda in 2020 to launch these ""mini-shops"" inside supermarkets. Shops contain a large number of B&Q's usual products, and customers can go to pick up orders from some branches. B&Q said the move was due to changes in shopper behaviour caused by the pandemic, which has seen people tie multiple shops into one single trip. B&Q strategy director Chris Bargate said: ""Following an extensive review of our test formats, we have decided to focus on developing our blueprint for smaller high street stores – our B&Q Local stores, with a view to expanding into more high streets."" Asda said: ""Following a ‘test and learn’ trial between B&Q and Asda, both businesses will continue to build on the learnings but will not be continuing with the concessions in Asda stores. ""The proposition was well received by customers, and Asda will use the lessons learned to help inform its wider concessions strategy."" It comes as a number of other high street giants have announced widespread store closures. Retailers are feeling the pinch due to high inflation, which was sitting at 10.5% in December. High inflation causes a squeeze on people's incomes - meaning many are forced to shop less. House of Fraser is set to close a number of stores as it battles to keep a presence on the high street. Just this week, it was announced clothing store M&Co will shut all 170 of its stores this year. Another popular high street store H&M also revealed it would be closing several branches. H&M confirmed to The Sun that two branches in Hartlepool and Isle of Wight are set to close. New Look has also brought the shutters down on three of its stores in recent weeks.

Urgent Netflix trick to check who has access to your account as extra charges roll out,"NETFLIX is widening its crackdown on password sharing, in a controversial attempt to draw in more paying viewers.  Customers in Canada, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain will now have to abide by the new restrictions.  Netflix has been trialling the restrictions on password sharing in Costa Rica, Peru and Chile. But it is expected to soon come to the UK and US.  The platform has been wrestling with falling viewership, as the battle between streamers like Prime, Disney+ and Apple TV rages on. Netflix estimates that 100million viewers are watching on shared accounts.  People on the same plan who live in a different house will ""need to use their own account"" to access the streaming platform under the new regime.  That means paying an extra $2.99 for a shared account. Many Netflix customers share their passwords willingly, be it with children who have moved away for university or a friend who wants to watch a show you've recommended.  But sometimes users can forget who they've shared their password with, or it may have even been stolen.  Whatever the case, there is a way to see who is using your Netflix account and a way to boot them out.  First, go to Netflix's website, and sign into your account.  Click your Profile in the top right corner of the screen > Account > Profile & Parenting Controls > Viewing Activity.  If someone is in fact using your account without your permission - or you simply don't want weird recommendations anymore - there's a simple fix.  Firstly, users can change their password.  Or, customers can sign out of Netflix on all devices in their Settings.  Head to Netflix, and sign into your account.  Then click on your Profile > Account > Security & Privacy > Manage Access and Devices > Sign out of the device you want or don't recognise.  The company said that devices detected in other locations ""may be blocked from watching Netflix"". This is done by tracking IP addresses, device IDs and account activity. If a device, say a TV or laptop, is logged into the account in a different location, Netflix will require a temporary code that lets users log in at that location for seven days. Those travelling with their 'primary device' - the device that is used for Netflix the most - will not have any issues in accessing content, Netflix said. However, users must make sure to connect to WiFi at their primary location at least once every 31 days to ensure uninterrupted access. ""If a Netflix account is used by a device that is not associated with the primary account owner's household, the device will need to be verified before it can be used to watch Netflix,"" the company wrote. ""We do this to confirm that the device using the account is authorised to do so."" Netflix stressed that it will not automatically charge users if they share their account with someone who doesn’t live with them. Looking for tips and hacks for your phone?

My husband tried to kill a man with a machete after blaming him for our son’s death – now I’ve lost them both,"A MUM has spoken of her torment after her husband was convicted of trying to kill a man he blamed for their son's death. Samson Price, 48, left Patrick Brown ""millimetres from death"" as he hacked at him with a machete outside a gym in Northwich, Cheshire. Price had blamed Brown for the death of his son Samson Price Jr, 18, who found dead in a pond in Wigan in October 2020. Fuelled by revenge, the dad launched into a frenzied attack on Brown, who was with the teen at the time of his death. His wife Rosanna has now revealed her heartache after Price was found guilty of attempted murder. She told Mail Online: ""'I have lost my son and now my husband faces God knows how many years in jail."" Jurors were told Price's son had drowned in a pond near the family home in Wigan, Greater Manchester. Brown and two other teens were arrested on suspicion of murder after the dad found his son's body. But a police probe found the death was accidental as there was evidence the group was taking LSD and Samson Jnr had wandered away alone. Rosanna said the family ""just want to know what happened"" to the teen and claimed there were ""so many"" police mistakes. The mum also hit out at Brown, who is a first cousin, and the other boys who left her son alone. She added: ""It just all gets to you - it consumes you. If he had been knocked over by a bus, at least you know what had happened. ""If they had come here to say ' sorry that we left him ', that would have been something. ""I do not think that they murdered my son. I think it was maybe a bad joke gone bad because they were off their heads. But I will never know if my son called out for me."" Price bought a 16-inch machete and electronic tracking device to locate Brown. In September 2021, he lay in wait outside the PureGym before frantically slashing at Brown in front of horrified gym-goers. As Brown attempted to flee, Price screamed ""I'll kill you"" and continued raining blows on his rival. He severed Brown's femur bone and only just missed a major artery, which would have caused him to bleed out within minutes. Price then fled the scene and evaded police for three weeks before eventually handing himself in. Rosanna said of the attack: ""My husband has never been in trouble - he did not have a wrong word to say about anyone. ""It just got to him that they did not even say sorry. He took it a different way than I did.  ""He did slice up Patrick Brown but he is still living and his family have still got their son. I would give anything to have my son back. I would not wish our pain on anyone. ""When I hear about other parents who have lost children, I now understand what they have gone through. Samson was my life. ""My husband took it a different way. I am not saying that what he did was right, but there were circumstances, there was pressure and there was devastation. He used to wake up screaming."" Price attempted to claim he did not want to kill Brown but instead ""give him a day of hell"". He told jurors during his evidence he wanted to leave him with scars to remind him of his son's death. The dad explained he was ""struck by the unfairness of it all"" when he saw Brown happy and speaking on the phone. But he claimed ""at no point"" was he trying to kill the victim as he was ""the only person who could tell us what happened to our son"". Rosanna said she is ""devastated"" at her husband's conviction as he awaits sentencing. She added: ""My husband may get 30 plus years and that lad is still walking up and down. But I have still not got any justice and that is all I have ever wanted. ""I do not know what happens now. I do not know what a normal life is. When something is ripped out of your life, it is just devastating."" Price will be sentenced on March 23.

"Teen girl, 18, ‘raped twice on night out including by passer-by who asked “can I have a go next?”‘","A TEEN was raped twice including by a passer-by who asked ""can I have a go next?"", a court heard. The 18-year-old student had become separated from her friends while on a night out in London's West End. Southwark Crown Court was told she ended up in Victoria Embankment Gardens where she was raped by a man. He is still on the loose following the alleged horror attack in August 2019, Mail Online reports. Jurors were told during that sex assault, a second man, Wesley Roden, approached and asked: ""Can I have a go next?"" The 33-year-old, who denies rape, was then allegedly told: ""Yeah, you can do what you like when I'm done"". Homeless Roden then forced himself on the student before she eventually left the park and was found by a ""good Samaritan"", jurors heard. Jurors were told the girl had been out with two friends after having ""pre-drinks"" of vodka, cider and beer. But when they were refused entry to Heaven nightclub, the group headed to a McDonald's to sober up. The alleged victim then got separated from her friends and gained entry to the nightclub. She was seen on CCTV leaving at 2.40am with the first suspect, who helped her climb over the locked parked gates, it was said. He was then recorded leaving alone, followed by the woman eight minutes later. Her friend sobbed as she told the court how the complainant was allegedly attacked. She said: ""She said all she could remember was walking down a dark road by Heaven towards the park.  ""She said: 'I didn't see the man's face. There was a bright light shining in my face'. ""She is such a sensible person. She had never gone missing before."" Roden was arrested at the Charing Cross subway, where he was sleeping rough, by officers saying they were investigating an ""incident"". The court was shown police bodycam footage of Roden saying he was ""f**king confused"" and was not ""involved in anything"". He said: ""I'm walking off the park and there's a guy and girl on the floor having sex, totally naked and they just carried on s****ing. ""The man said: 'Get yourself involved, get your pants down', and the girl said: 'Get yourself involved' and is pulling at my pants. ""It's the maddest situation ever and we both had sex with this girl and he was someone I did not even know. Is this something to do with that?"" After he was arrested, Roden replied: ""I'm not a rapist"". The trial continues.

"Earthquake death toll passes heart-wrenching 17,000 milestone as expert warns ‘today we’ll stop finding people alive’","TIME is ticking to pull survivors from the rubble after a deadly earthquake struck Turkey and Syria on Monday has left thousands dead. Turkish President Recep Erdogan admitted there have been ""shortcomings"" to rescue efforts since the devastating disaster, and experts have said time is running out. The death toll has now passed the threshold of 17,000 across Turkey and Syria since Monday's mega-quake. The survival window for those crushed underneath buildings across south Turkey and northern Syria is diminishing as days go by. The death toll is has reached 17,100 as of Thursday, with 3,162 dead in Syria and 14,014 dead in Turkey. Expert Steven Godby told Sky News: ""The survival ratio on average within 24 hours is 74%, after 72 hours it is 22% and by the fifth day it is 6%."" David Alexander, professor of emergency planning and management at University College London said today is the day when rescue workers stop finding people alive. He continued: ""That doesn't mean we should stop searching."" Turkish officials have said almost 3,000 buildings had collapsed in seven different provinces, including public hospitals. Heart-breaking photos and videos of victims being pulled from the dilapidated buildings have gone viral online. Photos of 2-year-old Mert Tatar being pulled from rubble after being trapped for 79 hours have gone viral online. The toddler was seen being carried off by rescue workers after they heard his cries through a concrete wall. The team drilled until they reached the tot who had been buried in rubble near Antakya. President Erdogan's office has received an influx of complaints about lack of equipment and experts to assist those trapped. Turkey levied a so-called “earthquake tax” after a 1999 quake killed 17,000 people. The £3.8billion raised was supposed to be used to prevent future disasters and fund emergency response teams. Opposition parties accused Mr Erdogan of failing to use the tax properly — resulting to a delayed response to the deadly quake. While visiting southern Turkey, Erdogan said: ""This is a time for unity, solidarity. In a period like this, I cannot stomach people conducting negative campaigns for political interest. ""It is not possible to be prepared for such a disaster. We will not leave any of our citizens uncared for."" The United Nation's resident Syria coordinator has begged the west for earthquake aide to rebel-held areas in Syria's northwest, which has been decimated by the natural disaster. Syria has been under fierce sanctions from the European Union, but the organisation changed its tune and has encouraged EU member countries to assist Syria after the catastrophe. Hope hasn't been lost, however, as rescue workers have miraciously found many alive after more than 72 hours. In Haram, northern Syria, siblings identified as Mariam and Ilaaf were saved after 36 hours under the rubble, with Mariam bravely shielding her little brother’s head. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said rescue teams from 18 nations are now in the region, helping save survivors under the wreckage. Sun readers have helped send over £500,000 to those affected by the disaster through our Earthquake Appeal after just two days of fundraising. All money from The Sun’s aid plea is being donated to the British Red Cross, providing on-the-ground relief in the wake of the disaster in Turkey and Syria.

"Major change to benefits from today and thousands could get up to £10,000 payment – check if you’re one of them","THOUSANDS more families can now apply for up to £10,000 in benefit payments from today. The change means that cohabiting parents with dependent children who need support following the death of their partner can now apply for bereavement benefits. The change will benefit 1,800 more families each year. Over 21,000 households affected by bereavement but previously denied support can also apply for backdated payments from today. Previously only married parents could claim bereavement benefits. However, campaigners defeated the policy in the High Court and Supreme Court back in August 2018. In response, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) published a ""remedial order"" last year granting the benefit to grieving partners. The amendment has now received Parliamentary approval, and the application window which allows those affected to apply for the cash is now open. To qualify for a payment, claimants must have met the eligibility criteria for either bereavement support payment or widowed parent’s allowance on or after August 30, 2018. This means those who lost their partner before April 6, 2017 might be able to receive the legacy benefit widowed parent’s allowance, should they be found to have been eligible for this on August 30, 2018. Similarly, a surviving parent who lost their partner on or after April 6, 2017 may be eligible for its replacement, bereavement support payment - should they have been qualified for this on August 30, 2018. The bereavement support payment is worth up to £3,500, plus £350 a month for 18 months for those eligible though, so the extra money will be welcomed by hard-up Brits that qualify. Keep in mind that the bereavement benefit and amount that people are entitled to will depend on when they lost their partner. If you receive child benefit you will receive the higher rates but in order to receive the full amount, you must claim within the first three months of your partner's death. If you are getting bereavement support payment, it won’t affect your other benefits for a year. After then, the income you get from it will be taken into account for means-tested benefits. Mims Davies, minister for social mobility, youth and progression said: ""We have made this important change to help thousands more grieving parents access the financial support they need and deserve. ""We know so many lone parents are doing their best to support their families through such a difficult time and our bereavement benefits offer a lifeline to help them adjust to the impact of this. ""I would urge anyone who thinks they may be eligible to make an application, as crucially, some bereaved parents will also be able to receive backdated payments to ensure they don’t miss out."" You can apply for bereavement support payment online, by telephone or by post. To apply, you’ll need: The government launched its new online claims form today (February 9) on a trial basis - so only a limited number of daily applications can be sent through. You can apply for the benefit over the phone by calling the bereavement service helpline on 0800 151 2012. To apply by post download the bereavement support payment BSP1 form from the government website, fill it in and return it to the address on the form.

Essex earthquake: British Geological Survey measures 2.6 magnitude tremor as locals woken by ‘loud bangs and rumble’,"RESIDENTS were woken by ""a loud bang and rumble"" as a 2.6 magnitude earthquake hit Essex last night. British Geological Survey sensors picked up the tremor near Bicknacre, with residents in nearby Chelmsford wondering if a ""bomb"" had gone off. The 2.6 magnitude earthquake hit at 5:05am, and its focus was 8.8km below ground level. One local described the earthquake as ""like an underground train going under a bungalow."" Another said it ""felt like a piece of large furniture had fallen over"". A third resident told the BGS said they were ""awoken by a loud bang and rumble."" Tremors were also felt in Wickford, Brentwood, Woodham, West Hanningfield, Great Baddow and Billericay. Many Essex residents were left wondering what had happened. A Chelmsford woman said: ""Was that a bomb or sonic boom? ""I heard a loud boom just before my house shook."" Linda said: ""I felt it too. I honestly thought I was dreaming."" Dean said: ""I'm in Woodham - I woke up and the house was shaking."" Wayne said: ""I thought it probably just a lorry driving over potholes."" It comes after the BGS recorded a 1.5 magnitude earthquake in Blackpool on 3 February. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21328305/essex-earthquake-bangs-rumble/
Martin Lewis warns thousands are missing out on free cash – how to claim £200 help now before you lose it,"MARTIN Lewis has warned that thousands of people off-grid could miss out on £200 free cash if they don't claim it now. The finance expert warned viewers on the latest episode of The Martin Lewis Money Show Live.  He said that people on prepayment meters will begin to get their £200 cost of living vouchers any time now.  The support is part of The Alternative Fuel Payment (AFP) scheme and helps struggling households knock money off their energy bills. But the MoneySavingExpert.com (MSE) founder warned that thousands of households are at risk of missing out because they haven't redeemed them.  He said: ""Those on prepayment [meters], you'll get vouchers, they'll email you, they'll post it or they may text you about it so watch out for that.  ""So many people haven't redeemed their vouchers."" He said that 20% of eligible people, often vulnerable, have not redeemed their vouchers from October and November.  Martin said the payments should all be made by the end of this month. Roughly 2.5million households who live off the gas grid have been able to apply for the funds from the start of this week. Brits will only get the cash if they warm their home using alternative energy sources such as heating oil, biomass and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). To be off the gas grid means you don't use mains gas. That means you'll only get the cash if you warm your home using alternative energy sources such as heating oil, biomass and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Recent government data suggests that Northern Irish households rely on heating oil the most - and costs have risen by up to 120 per cent in recent months. If you're not eligible for the £200 or £150 for business, there's more you can receive. For example, there's the £400 payment which has been split into six monthly instalments. Payments have been made since October, and the final payment will be made in March. For the majority of energy customers, their monthly bills are automatically discounted. However, households with traditional pre-payment meters are being sent vouchers to redeem at their nearest top-up point instead. Also, millions on benefits are in line for up to £1,350 in free cash from spring. The help is aimed to help soften the blow of high energy bills, food costs and other necessities. The first chunk of the £900 cost of living payment will be paid directly into claimants' accounts. Unlike last year's help, this cost of living payment will be paid in three, not two, instalments. More than eight million people will get the help directly to their bank accounts, and the £900 help will be paid over the financial year. And don't forget to keep checking your local council for the Household Support Fund scheme. Do you have a money problem that needs sorting?

Thousands of households can get £500 free cash to help with debts – check if you’re eligible,"THOUSANDS of households can get up to £500 in free cash to help with debt.  The support comes as part of the Household Support Fund - a £421million government pot to help those on low income. Many hard-up households are getting support from their local council through the scheme to help with the cost of living. That includes money for food, energy, fuel and other essentials.  Residents of Camden Council are being offered up to £500 to pay for such costs, which can be paid in up to two payments over a 12-month period.  There are options to receive cash into your bank account, vouchers or cost-cutting appliances such as a slow cooker or an air fryer. However, do note how much you receive will depend on your individual circumstances and the size of your home.  To apply, you'll need to prove you're on low income and urgently need the help.  This might mean printing a recent bank statement from earliest three months ago or providing proof of benefits.  You'll also need to be over 18 (unless you live independently at 16 and over) and you should've been living in Camden for at least six weeks.  You can only apply for one payment per household, and the person applying must be responsible for paying Council Tax. To apply, you can call Citizens Advice Camden on 0808 278 7835.  If you live in a council home, you can speak to your housing officer about it.  You can also reach out to an advice partner, whose contacts you can find on the council website. Keep in mind Citizens Advice Camden can also offer support on: Your local council will likely have its own version of the scheme going and you should get in contact with them to find out more. But be quick - while the deadline for councils to hand out the latest tranche of HSF cash support is March 31, 2023, it's done on a first-come-first-serve basis. For example, thousands of residents in Plymouth are due electronic vouchers to help pay for food and other essentials at supermarkets. And eligible households can get up to £180 in free supermarket vouchers depending on their circumstances. Thousands of residents in North Yorkshire are also due electronic supermarket vouchers worth up to £325. There are plenty of ways you can get debt advice and support if you're struggling.  For example, Citizens Advice is a national organisation with more than 20,000 volunteers who can help with everything from finding out what benefits you're entitled to, to claiming compensation for a cancelled flight. You can find your nearest branch using the tool on its website, or you can contact them by phone on 0800 133 8848. Its online chat tool is also available from 8am to 7pm Monday to Friday. Another one is StepChange, which offers support and guidance to help you take control of your money. You can do it online or over the phone, and it's completely confidential - you can call on 0300 303 5300. You'll need to provide details of your debts, income and household spending to get a clear picture of where your money goes. It can talk you through different options such as debt management plans (DMP), individual voluntary arrangements (IVA), bankruptcy, and debt relief orders (DRO) if they are appropriate. National Debtline also offers free and confidential advice to people in England, Wales and Scotland. You can contact it online or over the phone on 0808 808 4000, between 9am and 8pm Monday to Friday, and 9.30am to 1pm on Saturdays. Otherwise, you can use a benefits calculator, which can help you work if you might be entitled to extra cash. Organisation such as Mind, Samaritans and Anxiety UK are also available if debt worries are affecting your mental health. Find out if there is financial support that could help you too.

Yobs torch ‘THREE Royal Mail vans’ and three more cars in one night in mindless rampage as cops hunt culprit,"YOBS torched vans and cars in an overnight rampage - with Royal Mail vans among the vehicles targeted. Cops are now hunting the culprits after the attacks across Tower Hamlets, east London, in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Cops rushed to Royal Mail's Docklands Delivery Office just before 3am, after three vans were torched at the site. That same night, three more vans and three cars were set alight on nearby streets. Police are treating the incidents as suspicious, with the culprits still on the loose. It is also believed that an Openreach van on Salmon Lane was damaged in what a source described as an ""arson attack"" on Wednesday 8 February. Royal Mail was unable to comment as the incidents are now a police matter. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: ""We are investigating a series of vehicle fires in Tower Hamlets. ""At this time, the incidents are being treated as suspicious and enquiries remain ongoing. ""Anyone with information that could assist police is asked to call 101 or tweet @MetCC and quote ref 4204313/23. ""Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."" Pictures shared on social media showed a red Royal Mail van at the Docklands depot with the driver's window smashed and the interior melted by fire. A worker at the depot said: ""We've had four vans melted in total, one about a week or two ago while it was out on delivery and three more today. ""There was also some weird spray painting. No idea who did it."" A spokesman for the London Fire Brigade said: ""I can confirm that we received multiple calls overnight about several vehicle fires in the Limehouse area.""

Nicola Bulley YouTube sleuths slammed for filming themselves searching derelict buildings as cops warn them to stop,"A YOUTUBE sleuth searching for missing Nicola Bulley has been slammed for ignoring warnings from police, potentially destroying evidence and profiting from her family's heartache.  Danny, who describes himself as a ""paranormal investigator"", this week joined the frantic hunt for the mum-of-two who vanished almost two weeks ago.  The content creator, who goes by Exploring with Danny on social media, has shared several videos of his late-night ""investigation"" walks with his dog Molly and pal Felicity.  The trio have been scouring derelict buildings close to where Nicola was last seen in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, on January 27 - despite cops urging the public to stay away. Lancashire Police asked people not to ""take the law into their own hands"" and risk ""thwarting"" the investigation. Amateur detectives were warned against abusing witnesses or attempting to break into empty buildings as it is distressing to her family, distracting detectives and risks prosecution. But Danny travelled to conduct his own four-day examination of the bench where her phone was discovered and the surrounding area.  He said in one of his videos, where he uses a so-called ghost scanner and a drone: ""I'm here to do some paranormal stuff. ""If something has happened to Nicola then maybe she can give us a sign of where she is."" Danny then asks: ""Nicola, do you have a message for us? Did you fall into the lake? Do you need help?"" In another clip, he tries to get into a cobweb-covered building and a second with a ""private land"" sign.  He said: ""I've searched an abandoned house, around the perimeter, the bushes, the main roads, ponds, and people's back gardens at night with torches."" Danny, who has 205,000 YouTube subscribers, is understood to monetise his videos meaning he earns cash from views.  At the time of writing, his two about Nicola have a combined 26,000 views, with hundreds of thousands more on TikTok.  In them, he encourages his viewers to comment, subscribe, and ""smash the hell out of the 'like' button"".  While many of the comments praise his dedication to the cause, some think his actions are irresponsible.  One person said: ""You could be hampering evidence. No one knows where she is and you're using a spirit box assuming she's dead. ""Leave it to the professionals. ""You're sick for going into buildings looking for missing people without knowledge."" Another person commented: ""I feel the more people doing this is just ruining the evidence for the police. ""I get people want to help search but I think it makes it worse."" A third wrote: ""You could search without putting it on YouTube. It's like you need to advertise the fact"", to which another responded: ""This fella has travelled there for content."" And Clarabelle Simmy said: ""They should have closed all of this off to the public from the get go and searched everything."" Nicola's friends have also asked people to stop getting in the way of professionals.  Heather Gibbon said: ""Multiple police units are out in St Michaels dealing with people trespassing. ""We are at the point where people coming to 'help' look for Nikki in this way is actually doing the complete opposite.  ""You're taking police time and resources away from the investigation and you're letting speculation take away from the actual facts.  ""We are at the point where this type of 'help' is making people who live in St Michaels feel unsafe. Please don't let this continue to happen."" We are at the point where people coming to 'help' look for Nikki in this way is actually doing the complete opposite.  Nicola, known as Nikki, was last seen walking her Springer Spaniel at around 9.15am on the day she disappeared. She had dropped her daughters off at school earlier that morning then headed to the River Wyre. There, the mortgage adviser joined a conference call, which her phone was still connected to when it was found on a bench alongside her dog's lead and harness near Garstang Road at 9.35am. A major and ""complex"" search operation was launched along a nine-mile stretch of the tidal river, which is now in its 14th day. Supt Sally Riley said: ""We will not tolerate online abuse of anyone, including innocent witnesses, members of the family and friends, of local businesses, or of criminal damage or burglary. ""We will be taking a strong line on that, as you would expect. ""There are some properties along the riverside which are empty or derelict. ""Whilst it may be well intentioned that people think that that could be a line of inquiry, I would ask them to desist from doing that. ""In some cases it may be criminal if they are breaking in and causing damage or committing a burglary. ""It is not helpful if people, particularly if they come from outside the area, take it upon themselves to take the law into their own hands by trying to, for example, break into empty property."" A dispersal order was issued after a group of men travelled from Liverpool to help find Nicola, TalkTV reports. Detective Supt Rebecca Smith, who insists cops are keeping an ""open mind"" over what happened, said: ""The team working on this investigation are completely dedicated and determined to find Nicola. ""Please be reassured our sole focus is Nicola and that we are doing everything we can to find her."" For days, officers believed she fell into the icy water and drowned, sparking a huge search by specialist divers. But after no sign of her, officers now worry Nicola may have left the area on a path not covered by CCTV. Dashcam footage from more than 700 drivers who passed along the road at the time she disappeared is frantically being sought. Anybody with information is asked to call 101, quoting log 473 of January 27, or ring 999 for immediate sightings. The Sun has approached Danny for comment.

Who is Frank Bough’s wife Nesta Howells and how many children did they have?,"BEHIND every great man is a great woman, as was the case with the late Frank Bough. Nesta Howells, so often the rock for the man in front of the camera, managed to do just that. Bough met Nesta Howells while he was doing his national service in the Royal Tank Regiment. The pair married after Bough left the Army in 1959. He was once one of the BBC’s top wage earners and highest profile presenters. His career began in 1964 when he presented the show Sportsview, taking over from Peter Dimmock. Bough later established himself as a TV personality and became one of the highest-paid presenters on the BBC - earning a huge £200,000 at the time. However, his BBC career came to an abrupt end in 1988 after they sacked him following a newspaper expose which revealed he allegedly took cocaine and visited Mayfair brothels. After leaving the BBC, Bough went on to present on ITV and Sky TV but his reputation never recovered. His wife stood by him despite the scandal and remained with him until his death. She admitted though she had been angry and had considered leaving him. She said in a Sky News programme: “Obviously I have thought, ‘Do I stay or do I go?’.  “We have been together a long time. We have brought up a family. “We have still got a lot going for us. I do feel betrayed by it, but I do not feel that it is anything personal to do with me.” They had three sons: David, Stephen and Andrew. For some 20 years or so, Frank had been living with his wife in Holyport, Berkshire. He died on October 21, 2020, in a care home at the age of 87-years-old. The direct cause of his death is still unknown. He had a liver transplant in 2001 after he was diagnosed with cancer. The operation was a success and he went on to live for another 19 years. Tributes poured in for the presenter, with Piers Morgan tweeting: ""RIP Frank Bough, 87. ""Star of Grandstand, Nationwide and Breakfast Time. ""His career was ruined by scandal, but he was one of the great live TV presenters. Sad news."" Soccer Saturday host Jeff Stelling said Bough was “one of the very best in the business” and had always been “helpful and generous with his time”.

Our once-thriving high street now looks like ‘second-class Las Vegas’ with eyesore shopfronts – it’s ruining our city,"OUTRAGED residents are devastated their once-thriving city has deteriorated into a ""second-class Las Vegas."" Disgusted locals in Canterbury have united with the council to crackdown on ""overbearing,"" offensive and garish shops destroying their town. Marcus, 18, who lives nearby, agreed the storefronts are creating a tacky image for the area.  He told Kent Online: ""I always thought that those shops were rather garish and they all seem to have similar names – it’s all rather weird. ""The lights on the high street are definitely a bit too far. ""We’re in the centre of town so the jurisdiction has to apply – especially with listed buildings. ""If you just left it to the shopkeepers, then Canterbury’s high street wouldn’t look like Canterbury’s high street."" Another disappointed local, Mary Anderson, said the new and offensive shops are constantly popping up. ""I think it is very important to maintain the character of the town,"" she urged.  Councillor Nick Eden-Green said: ""We’ve got to do something about it urgently, because it’s frankly like a second-class Las Vegas in Canterbury now.” While other people, such as Natasha from Folkestone, offered a mixed opinion.  The 42-year-old sympathised with struggling businesses but wanted the council to uphold Canterbury's historic value. ""There are a lot of vape shops - maybe we should just cut back on those types of shops,"" she suggested. Kabil Singh, who manages iCrash as well as iRepair in St George’s Street has come under fire for his signage. He defended himself and said: ""A lot of shops have signs like that. ""I don’t think they make the high street look bad, because there are a lot of stores - there’s Third Eye and another vape shop. And there is a chicken shop called Smokey’s. “Businesses are struggling. We’ve come out from coronavirus, there’s a war between Ukraine and Russia - it’s impacted all businesses. “They have to support the businesses, not destroy the businesses. They’re constantly charging us business rates for this place. Now for months, they’re closing the high street [for redevelopment works]. We’ve got to do something about it urgently, because it’s frankly like a second-class Las Vegas in Canterbury now.” “You can see [the construction] in front of the shop. We can’t survive.” However, in good spirit he said he's happy to work with the council to resolve the dispute.  At a city council meeting on Tuesday, Cllr Nick Eden-Green told colleagues the scourge is “getting worse by the day.”  “People are just completely taking the mickey."" Neil Baker suggested sites such as the High Street branch of iCrash should be reprimanded for its signage. “Buildings that project apes smoking cannabis onto the pavement probably were [on the list],” he told the meeting. “Once Canterbury has had its crackdown it will hopefully then be rolled out to other parts of the district which are suffering as well.” This debate has led to more than 30 retailers being ordered to remove signage and lights from their store fronts. Council officials claim their goal is to make sure the areas - which hold World Heritage Site status - “remain healthy and vibrant and are places people want to visit”. The council’s enforcement boss, Cllr Ashley Clark, said: “The district’s history and heritage are the jewels in its crown, and we need to move heaven and earth to protect it. “We know businesses are facing a multitude of challenges, but it is vital we preserve the character of the areas that we love – our residents and visitors demand nothing less.  ""That is why we have invested in the planners and lawyers we need to make sure people follow the rules.” This comes desperate residents in hundreds of once-thriving towns across the UK are now struggling.  In Sturry, Kent, residents say they are feeling more shut off as ever due to a series of closures on its high street.  OAP Ann Alexander, 84, said: ""That will be a nightmare. I use it at least three times a week."" And she also noticed the decline in Canterbury, mentioned above. ""Canterbury is bad too. I don't think they want people to come anymore,"" she added. ""There's no community feel. None. It's sad. It's very sad. We just don't see anybody."" Elsewhere in the UK locals in Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland, expressed their disappointment in the council and state of their town.  They claimed the council fails to keep the streets clean, maintain flower beds or respond to questions. The once bustling market town now lies barren with most high street shops sitting empty. One retired off-shore worker, 72, said: ""If you want to know how to kill a town then look at Berwick."" And in Withernsea, East Yorkshire, a popular seaside resort in the summer, locals are struggling to afford food in the off season. The town has been ravaged by the crippling cost of living crisis - leaving hundreds dependent on emergency food parcels. It's seen hundreds more households signed up to a community scheme to pick up supermarket food at knock-down prices. Charity bosses say the town is now so poor some kids have ""no shoes"" and warn how parents have turned to predatory loan sharks to survive.

WhatsApp is making a huge change to voice notes – but there’s a catch,"WHATSAPP is hauling in a feature that will let its 2billion users transcribe voice notes. But there is one catch: It's actually not ready to be launched yet.  The feature isn't even ready to be rolled out to beta testers.  WhatsApp's beta program hosts a handful of lucky WhatsApp users who get to try out experimental features before they're introduced to all users.  The update will eventually go through the beta program, which hosts 15 to 20 users in a range of regions, like North America and Europe for example.  But the voice note transcription feature is still under development, following a setback. WhatsApp began working on bringing the ability to transcribe voice notes back in September 2021.  But the feature's development was interrupted for an unknown reason.  This is not uncommon with behind-the-scenes features. However, the Meta-owned messaging app is finally working on feature again, WaBetaInfo reported.  WhatsApp on Tuesday rolled out a string of new features for users to chew on while they await the upcoming voice note transcription feature.  Meta, which owns WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram, has been busy introducing a new 'status' feature to its platforms over the past week. Facebook has famously had the status feature since its inception. But it has recently made its way onto Instagram, and today onto WhatsApp. ""Status is a popular way to share ephemeral updates with friends and close contacts on WhatsApp,"" the company said in a blog post today. ""They disappear in 24 hours and may include photos, videos, GIFs, text, and more."" Looking for tips and hacks for your phone? Want to find those secret features within social media apps?

"Boyfriend told 999 operator ‘there’s blood everywhere’ after ‘stabbing’ girlfriend, 22, to death then calling solicitor","A BOYFRIEND told 999 operators ""there's blood everywhere"" after stabbing his girlfriend to death, a court heard. Kevin Mannion, 45, allegedly knifed Elinor O'Brien, 22, in a ""rageful and violent attack"" at his home in Manchester. He then made a 999 call where he repeatedly said Elinor's name, Liverpool Crown Court was told. In the call played to jurors, Mannion added: ""There’s blood everywhere. She’s been punctured in the groin. Please come. ""You need to help. She’s dying, she’s dying. Please, please, please come. ""I’m begging you to hurry up. ""She’s been cut with a sharp object.

""I’m begging you to get someone here.” The court was told emergency services arrived at Great Northern Tower at around 12:30pm on August 16. PC Luke Needham said Mannion was lying over Elinor by a pool of blood on the floor in his flat. The officer told jurors it was ""clear"" he was attempting to stem the flow of blood. Mannion then told officers: ""Thank God you are here"". PC Needham said the alleged killer was ""sweating a lot"" and ""breathing heavily"". The court heard Mannion made a phonecall to a number saved as ""Greg - solicitor"", saying ""something is going on"". Mannion also said ""I know the police are going to want to speak to me. I just need you there"", it is alleged. Elinor was rushed to hospital where she died three days later following a ""catastrophic"" brain injury. The court was told a neighbour had heard ""arguing"" coming from the flat before the horror unfolded. He described the shouting as ""higher pitched"" and said there was ""screaming"", jurors heard.

I worked on Magaluf’s wildest bar crawl and can lift lid on what REALLY happens behind the scenes… it was utter chaos,"IT may have scrubbed up in recent years, but Magaluf was once the party capital of Europe, with thousands of Brits searching for sun, sea and sex. The coastal town in Majorca, Spain, was flooded every summer by randy teenagers, who were easy targets for reps trying to flog them cheap drinks and cheaper thrills. Amid the bustling strip of boozers was the Magaluf club Playhouse, whose former owner hit the headlines last month after being accused of a fake holiday sickness scam that defrauded hotels out of £9.5million. The venue was previously fined after a British tourist was filmed performing sex acts on 24 men for a cheap drink in the summer of 2014 - leading to its closure and stricter laws that brought an end to the island's debauched parties.  Gia Clarke, 28, from Leeds, used to sell tickets for the infamous event Carnage, which passed through Playhouse during its wild all-night bar crawls.  Sharing her memories, she tells The Sun how the crawl was ""pure and utter chaos"" , before events got out of hand and she realised ""they had gone too far"". Gia was 19 when she started working for the Carnage events back in 2013.  Following a week of fun on her first friends' holiday, she decided to stay out on the island - much to her mum’s annoyance. Gia explains: “I didn’t like the pub I was working at and didn’t want to leave Magaluf, so I decided not to. “My mum was like, ‘You better come home!’ but I didn’t. ""The only problem I had was money and that’s how I stumbled upon ticket-selling for Carnage.” Gia recalls earning €10 (£8.90) commission from every ticket sold, which was miles better than shot girl jobs that made 50 cents (44p) per sale. She said: “You’d likely sell 10 tickets a day so that’s €100 (£88), which is a lot for a 19-year-old in Majorca. It felt like being a millionaire.” But flogging tickets wasn’t as easy as it appeared, because hotels were desperate to sign up eager Brits on their own bar crawls. Gia said: “We used to have to sneak into hotels. They were partnered up with different events and bar crawls so we had to be clever. “There was a lot of competition between the reps but people knew of Carnage and how wild it was. They wanted that experience, so we found a way to sell them tickets. “It didn’t always work out. I remember going into one hotel and they called both security and the police and searched me.” Once they were inside the hotels, there was another challenge - finding a way to get to the guests. Gia recalled: “They used to send us doorknocking, so every night we were crawling around hotels trying to sell tickets. “I would knock on every single hotel room. If a group of guys answered I’d put on the charm but if it was girls, I’d say, ‘Sorry wrong room.’"" Gia recalls the Magaluf strip being flooded with partygoers during the busiest times in the season - and most visitors were hunting for Carnage events. She said: “In August it was so busy you could barely move down the strip. There were hundreds and hundreds of people. “We had the biggest bar crawl ever. It was the best one and I’m glad I worked for it - even though it was a mess.  “All the others were very tame. Our biggest selling point was that our crawl was a bit naughty."" Carnage quickly earned a reputation for wild, boozy nights and risque games. Gia recalls: “During the games, they would go into the crowds to find a guy and a girl, bring them up on stage and get them to do dares to win a bottle of vodka or other alcohol. “It was a very 'lads, lads, lads' kind of environment and there would be things like lap dances, taking shots from each others’ mouths and getting into lots of sex positions.  ""Sometimes I'd see people having full-on sex on the crawls too. “There was obviously a sexual element, but people went to Magaluf to let their hair down and be wild. “We used to record these wild antics to help us to sell tickets. We would show them to men in hotels and they loved it.” While they lured in customers offering free drinks, Gia explains customers got way less than they realised. “It would be worded cleverly so that it sounded like free drinks all night, but did not sell itself as an all-inclusive bar,” she recalled. “They were just getting cheap apple sours poured into their mouths. It caught out a lot of people out but they all had a fun time.”  Gia described the tour as “the devil” at times due to the saucy antics and revealed some venues refused to let them in. “There was a lot of competition between the bars and some had rivalries. They would have beef with each other,"" she said. “If they knew you were going to one bar they would turn you away and not let you into their venue because you worked with their enemies. “The bar workers used to say ‘No possible!’, which led to me getting an embarrassing drunken tattoo of those words on my bum."" After a few too many drinks, Gia says some of the partygoers would end up in strip clubs and it didn’t always end well. She says strippers could make up to €6,000 (£5,300) a week during the busiest times and earned so much money that they could take half a year off. Gia said: “Strippers used to stand outside in front of the clubs in their bras and knickers to lure men in. It may sound bad, but I saw way worse on Carnage bar crawls.  “I know strippers have been thrown up on many times from the guys drinking too much, there was a lot of chundering. “I remember someone nearly drank a shot glass filled with sick because they picked it up and didn't know what it was.” Like with any bar crawl, not everyone made it to the end but with Carnage there was an easy tell-tale sign for those who dropped out. Gia said: “Obviously you would lose guests on the bar crawl and would get a few stragglers who dropped off too.  “But a lot of times, the next morning you’d see a random guy or girl doing the walk of shame along the beach. ""It was obvious they had been on the crawl because they were still wearing their Carnage top. I did it a few times myself too.” Carnage came under fire after footage of a woman performing sex acts on multiple men during one of their crawls emerged online. It was claimed the 18-year-old believed she was going to win a free holiday - which turned out to be a cocktail named holiday that cost less than a fiver. The bar where it happened and Carnage were fined a joint sum of £43,500, and the council hoped to shut them down.  ""They started pushing it more and more, seeing what they could get people to do sexually,"" Gia explains. ""When I started they were getting girls to do fun stuff but towards the end was when they were milking it. That's when the video came out of the girl. I realised they had gone too far.  ""They were all 'lads, lads, lads' and thought they could get away with it. I wasn't surprised when it was shut down, would anyone be?"" In the years that followed, Magaluf tried to change its reputation and enforce stricter laws.  “They have given it a makeover too,” Gia said. “It’s very Instagrammable and they have got rid of the dingy bar crawls for nicer places. “They are trying to be the new Ibiza but they’re missing the point. You want Maga to be disgusting."" ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21313421/magaluf-party-wildest-bar-crawl/
Fears Putin is readying MAJOR Satan-2 nuke missile launch on exact date to ‘get the world’s attention’ over Ukraine,"VLADIMIR Putin is feared to be readying the launch of the catastrophic Satan-2 nuke missile in a chilling message to the West. The major new test launch is set to coincide with the Kremlin's massive offensive planned in days. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers are gearing up for the offensive, which will mark the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Ukrainians are bracing for the new assault that is set to include 1,800 tanks, 3,950 armoured vehicles, 400 fighter jets and 300 helicopters incoming from Russia. Putin is also gathering 2,700 artillery guns and 810 rocket launchers for the ""new wave of attacks"", according to Foreign Policy. But it is the carnage of the 208-ton hypersonic Satan-2 rocket that is feared the most. It measures 116 feet in length and can be loaded with 15 light nuclear warheads at once. It has the potential to obliterate the United Kingdom 1,600 miles away in just six minutes. And with an operational range of up to 11,180 miles, the deadly missile is reported to have no equivalent in the West for the terror it could unleash.  However, military insiders expect the staging to be a test launch, following unexplained delays in the development and deployment of Putin’s ""big beast"" weapon. According to Telegram channel MilitaryRussia, there is also a possibility mad Vlad could  test launch a Bulava or Yars missile. The fears follow a test launch warning issued by Russian authorities. Officials in remote districts of Kamchatka, Russia, have been warned to be ready for a test launch of a nuclear-capable strategic missile between February 15  and February 25.  It will be launched at Kura test range, with restrictions on movements for local residents to be put in place in three districts. The areas at risk include Tigilsky, Karaginsky and Ust-Kamchatsky districts on the Kamchatka peninsula. The have been declared ""danger zones"" where missile fragments might fall while the military carries out ""experimental and testing work"". The danger zones cover territory larger than England and the entire air space will be closed. The tests come as Russian propagandists step up warnings of the use of nuclear weapons amid deep east-west tensions. In January, Putin conceded the launch of his Satan-2  had been delayed. His hampered plans follow the failed timeline set by the Kremlin to have it ready for deployment by the end of last year. Speaking in December to Russian state media, Putin said: ""In the near future, Sarmat ICBMs will be put on combat duty for the first time.  ""We know there will be a certain delay in time but this does not change our plans – everything will be done."" That same day, defence minister Sergei Shoigu said it was only possible to ""begin work on its deployment"". There has only been one definitive test flight of a Satan-2 missile, which happened in April, 2022. The silo-based launch was from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northern Russia. And the missile, without a nuclear warhead, made a 26ft deep crater at the Kura test site.  It was confirmed by Sergey Karakaev, commander of Russian Strategic Missile Forces, who said: ""Flight tests of the Sarmat missile system have been successfully carried out."" No additional launches have been reported. However, defence analysts suspect the launch of the hypersonic missile could be hyperbole. It was reported Russia’s earlier R-36M2 Voevoda missile was tested 17 times before it was put on combat duty.  Another missile, the RT-2PM Topol, was tested 12 times before deployment.  In May last year, Dmitry Rogozin, former head of the Russian Space Agency, claimed almost 50 Satan-2 missiles were in mass production.

February half term travel warning with Border Force strikes planned – five tips for travelling during walkout action,"HOLIDAYMAKERS have been urged to plan for mass disruption at ports next week as Border Force officials go on strike.  Industrial action is planned for February 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th, with hundreds of staff walking out. The strike will affect inbound international travel from the Port of Calais, Port of Dunkirk, Coquelles Channel Tunnel Terminal and the Port of Dover.  The PCS union, representing Border Force staff, want an inflation busting pay rise for their members. But this has been rejected by government, who say it's unaffordable and will make inflation worse.  Military personnel, civil servants and volunteers are currently being trained to man border security on strike days. However, disruption during the February half term will still be widespread.  Steve Dann Border Force Chief Operating Officer said: ""It is disappointing for travellers that yet again strike action may cause disruption for those entering the UK. ""Border Force’s number one priority to is keep our citizens safe and borders secure. We are working together with partners across the travel industry and our French counterparts to ensure we can continue to meet critical demand and support the flow of passengers and goods through our border. ""During the periods of industrial action, travellers should be prepared for disruption. We encourage everyone to check the latest advice from operators before travelling."" The government has published five tips for minimising disruption during the strikes. They are: 1. When travelling into the UK, please prepare yourself and your family for longer wait times at border control. 2. Use eGates where available as the quickest and most efficient way to pass through border control. 3. Always check with your operator before you travel and follow their advice on when to arrive at the port / terminal. 4. Be kind and patient with Border Force staff, who are working hard over this challenging period to support passengers and ensure you get to where you want to be. 5. Be reassured that we have additional resource to support travellers and Border Force’s number one priority is to keep our border safe and secure for all passengers.

How to spot a ‘rare’ £20 note and the serial numbers that could be worth hundreds,"IT turns out it's not just rare coins that could soak up the dosh - it's bank notes too. There are a number of £20 notes floating about that can score particularly high bids at online auctions, all because they have a quirky serial number. For instance, a polymer £5 note with an early serial number sold for more than £50,000 on eBay in 2017. Even when they were first introduced, fivers with the serial number AA01 fetched hundreds of pounds online. With the current £20 notes having been in circulation for a couple of years, here's how to spot if you get your hands on a rare note and make a mint. Banknotes that have very early serial numbers are often sought after by collectors. This is because not many of them tend to make it into circulation. 
  When the Bank of England issues a new note it donates those with significant numbers to the people and institutions involved in the development. For example, the first note AA01 000001 is given to the King. The bank also tends to donate lots of the earliest notes to charities for auction. But the Bank of England confirmed not all the early £20 notes were reserved, meaning some of the rarest AA notes are in circulation. AA notes are the most valuable, but anything with an A in it could be worth more than the value of the note itself. An AA01 £5 note sold on eBay for over £60,000 in 2017.

How to check if you have a rare and valuable banknote

 


    Notes with consecutive serial numbers can also catch a collector's eye, particularly if the numbers are low. If you can combine an early serial letter, with a consecutive number you could be onto a winner. For instance if you get one with AA1234567, it's likely to be popular. Two notes with the serial numbers AA01090561 and AA01090562 sold for more than £50 in March 2020. To make a profit, people usually try and sell them on eBay or Facebook, sometimes making hundreds of pounds. When the Jane Austen £5 notes came out in 2017 there was lots of interest in numbers that were linked to her life. For instance, collectors hunted for the serial numbers 16 121775 and 18 071817 because they are the author's birth and death dates. Also, the £20 notes released in 2020 feature artist JMW Turner, so serial numbers with his birth date - 1775 - could be a winner. If you find one starting with an A that also includes his birth date that should be worth even more. One special serial number to keep an eye out for is 1775 1851 which combines the painter's birth and death date. A note starting with JT could be valuable in theory, but there would have to be a lot of notes printed to reach this, so the notes are unlikely to end up in circulation. There are also sets of serial numbers that always prove popular regardless of who is on the note, for instance 007 for James Bond or AK47. AK47 notes have been listed for as much as £160,000 but most have been selling for about £100. How much is an AK47 £5 note worth and what are the Jane Austen fivers with the valuable serial numbers? What do the rare new £10 notes look like and how can you tell if your tenner could make you rich? When is the new £20 note out, who is JMW Turner and when will the old ones go out of circulation?

Prankster adds spot where Prince Harry lost his virginity on Google Maps – and it’s approved as a ‘historical landmark’,"GOOGLE Maps users were stunned to find the spot where Prince Harry lost his virginity marked on the platform as a ""historical landmark"".

But former Highgrove groom Sasha Walpole, 40, recently admitted it was her. Speaking exclusively to The Sun on Sunday, she said they had a passionate five-minute romp while the royal’s security searched for him in a blue Ford Fiesta.

Major twist in Nicola Bulley case as search could lead police 20 miles from where she went missing,"THE search for missing mum Nicola Bulley could leads cops 20 miles from where she vanished in a major twist to the investigation. Mum-of-two Nicola has been missing since she disappeared while walking her dog in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, on January 27. It has now emerged that the hunt could take Lancashire Police as far away as Morecambe Bay as divers search the River Wyre. Detectives believe that the 45-year-old fell into the river, which flows all the way to Morecambe, between 9.10am and 9.20am that day while on a walk with her springer spaniel, Willow. The update represents a major twist in the case after underwater search expert Peter Faulding said that there was ""no way"" she could have reached the sea even if the current theory is true. Faulding, whose team was assisting the police in the search, told GB News: ""We've been using the high frequency side scan sonar in this stretch today and it's so detailed I can even see every stone of it. She's not in this stretch. ""We also sonar-ed on the other side down yesterday in the tidal river. Now if you take a football on a tidal river…when the tide goes out the ball will go down the stream and then as soon as the tide turns it will come back in again. It'll end up back at the same place. ""For Nicola to get out to the sea would be impossible, literally, it is such a long way."" However, he and his team have now dramatically withdrawn from the effort, saying that Nicola may ""never be found"". Meanwhile, police divers are understood to be focussing their attention of parts of the river further downstream from the initial disappearance site and possibly as far away as its mouth in Morecambe. The Wyre flows through the southern end of the bay and out into the Irish sea. Nicola Bulley vanished while walking near St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, on January 27. Cops believe that she fell into the river as she walked her springer spaniel Willow. At the time of her disappearance, she was wearing a long black gilet jacket with a hood and had her hair tied in a ponytail. She had black jeans on with olive green ankle wellies. Nicola's phone and the dog's lead were found on a bench nearby. She was last seen at 9.10am that morning. Superintendent Sally Riley of Lancashire Police confirmed there is a ten minute window where they cannot account for Nicola's movements, amid fears she left the path in a CCTV blackspot. This is between the last confirmed sighting at 9.10am, and 9.20am when Nicola's phone was connected to a work call on the bench. The Sun Online has produced a full timeline of the case with every detail available. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21331056/major-twist-nicola-bulley-search/
Brit tank crew takes The Sun on war games with Challenger 2 as battle armour sent to Ukraine to beat Putin,"A BRIT tank crew took The Sun up close and personal with the mighty Challenger 2 tank on exercise near the border with Russia. Some 14 of the incredible main battle tanks are due to be shipped to Ukraine as part of military aid to help them defeat Vladimir Putin.  The UK government is also sending some 30 A90 self-propelled artillery guns - which were also taking part in the exercises we were embedded with in Estonia. Nato forces - including the UK - put troops through their paces in bitterly cold -12C conditions under the shadow cast by the war in Ukraine. And as part of the drill, the heavy armour was wheeled out to show how it easily copes in the snow. Major Nick Bridges led us through a guided tour of the mighty Challenger 2, which weighs in at 64 tons and costs £4.2million. ""Much like a boxer in the ring, the Challenger 2 can take hits and continue to fight, whereas other tanks around the world might be knocked out after one round,"" said Major Bridges.  He went on: ""The Challenger 2 was designed to meet the requirements of fighting the Warsaw Pact, based on the British Army's presence in Germany, so it's requirements are designed to meet a more defensive stance. ""Hence why it's not as fast as a Leopard tank, but it has a lot of additional armour."" Around 30 Challenger 2 battle tanks are currently in action as part of Nato's Winter Camp in Rakvere - just 80 miles from the border with Russia. They are from armoured regiment the King’s Royal Hussars.  The impressive machines were deployed alongside other tanks, vehicles and troops from Estonia, France, Denmark and the US. Maj Bridges explained the tank's steady ride on advanced suspension allows for more accurate shots from the main gun. And he revealed its clever exhausts allow heat to be better dispersed around the tank, making them harder to detect with infrared cameras. The 1,200bhp tank's 120mm cannon can be armed with armour piercing shells that fly towards the enemy at 4,250mph.  It can also be armed with high explosive bunker busting shells that can blow up light enemy vehicles or entrenched positions.  The Challenger 2 can carry up to 1,800 litres of diesel, giving them an average 341 miles range at a speed of 37mph.  If needed, additional fuel can be sprayed on the hot engine to produce a smoke screen, providing cover for the tank. The tank driver controls the vehicle with two sticks from an almost lying down position. On each side are five smoke grenade dischargers, with can be fired as a smoke screen to the front, protecting against laser beam-riding missiles. It also has a chain gun spitting out 7.62mm rounds to rip through soft-skinned vehicles such as trucks, or dismounted infantry. Ukrainian soldiers are currently in the UK training how to use the Challenger 2s before they head to the battlefield against Russia. The troops were visited yesterday by Volodymyr Zelensky and Rishi Sunak at Lulworth Camp in Dorset. Zelensky was making his first visit to the UK since the start of the war - and gave a rousing speech at Westminster.  The tightly controlled surprise visit came as he continues to call for more aid from the West. And it comes amid the backdrop of a possible new Russian offensive later this month. Zelensky called for the UK to send him fighter jets, urging MPs to give his forces ""wings for freedom"".  Sunak said ""nothing is off the table"" when it comes to the question of providing combat aircraft to Ukraine. The Prime Minister added sending warplanes is ""part of the conversation"" about further aid to Kyiv. Mr Zelensky warned that without supplies, including jets, ammunition and long-range missiles, there is a risk of ""stagnation"" in the conflict. Downing Street confirmed that Mr Sunak has asked Defence Secretary Ben Wallace to investigate what jets the UK could potentially give. Today Mr Wallace told the BBC there would be no immediate transfer of jets, and supplying them would take months. He said it was ""more realistic and more productive"" to envisage the UK providing aircraft in the long-term to ensure Ukraine's security after the war has ended. ""This is not a simple case of towing an aircraft to the border,"" Mr Wallace told the BBC. The UK also announced that it will start training Ukrainian air force pilots as part of a long-term strategy to safeguard Kyiv's future. It marked a change in approach, with No 10 previously arguing that it would take too long to train pilots to fly Western fighter planes to have an impact on the war in eastern Europe. The Russian Embassy in London warned the UK against supplying warplanes, saying Britain would bear responsibility ""for another twist of escalation and the ensuing military-political consequences for the European continent and the entire world"". It warned: “Russia will know how to respond to any unfriendly actions by the British side."" The United States and other Nato allies have been wary of becoming more involved in the conflict for fear of provoking the Kremlin. Mr Zelensky's trip to the UK included talks with Mr Sunak in Downing Street, a meeting with the King at Buckingham Palace, and a visit to Ukrainian armed forces in Dorset where they are being trained to use Challenger 2 tanks. He then travelled to Paris to meet French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, telling a press conference there is ""very little time"" to provide the weaponry. He he then went with Mr Macron to a gathering of EU leaders. It is only his second trip abroad since Moscow's forces launched their full-scale invasion nearly a year ago.

"Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s remove vapes from sale over health fears","MAJOR supermarkets have banned the sale of some vapes over health fears.  Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury's have removed the Elf Bar 600 series from sale. The supermarket giants have cleared the e-cig from shelves after they were found to contain 50% more than the legal limit for nicotine e-liquid. The vapes, which would normally cost between £3.80 and £6 at the supermarkets, have been banned following a Daily Mail investigation.  The national limit for nicotine liquid in a vape is currently at 2ml - which equates to a maximum 2% nicotine strength. But tests conducted by the newspaper found they included between 3ml and 3.2ml each. An Elf Bar spokesperson told the paper that some batches have been ""inadvertently"" overfilled in the UK and apologised for the inconvenience.   Sainsbury's told The Sun it has removed all Elf Bar products from stores ""whilst our suppliers investigate this matter further"". Morrisons said it is investigation the issue and has removed all flavours of the e-cig. A Morrisons spokesperson said: ""As part of our ongoing investigation into the legal compliance of Elf Bar 600 disposable electronic cigarettes with Trading Standards, we have made the decision to remove all flavoured variants from sale. ""The products will only be returned to sale once stock that fully complies with UK legislation becomes available.""  Elf Bar and Trading Standards has been contacted for comment. Tesco has also removed some Elf Bar products from sale, the Mail reports. The Sun has approached the supermarket for comment. Elf Bar, a China-based company, sells up to 2.5million Elf Bars 600s every week in the UK, according to the report. Normally, single Elf Bars from the 600 series cost £3.80 from Tesco, £5.99 from Morrisons and £6 from Sainsbury's. We've asked all three supermarkets if they will offer refunds to anyone who has bought the product and will update when we hear back. Shops often offer refunds when items are recalled, but these are usually after official notices from the Food Standards Agency (FSA). Last year Trading Standards officers found the illegal e-cigarettes with nicotine levels twice the UK legal limit being sold in corner shops. The Geek Bar Pro vapes were not authorised to be sold by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Recent data from Action on Smoking (ASH) revealed that the number of kids vaping has increased. The number of children that admitted to trying the products has risen from 14% in 2020 to 16% in 2022. Across the UK, vaping and e-cigarettes come under the same law as smoking. This law states that it's illegal to sell any tobacco products to someone under the age of 18. Recent data from NHS Digital found that kids under the age of nine are being taken to hospital with breathing conditions linked to vaping. In December Waitrose announced it would stop selling single-use vaping products, including two types of e-cigarettes. Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Asda and Co op still sell single-use vapes.

Nicola Bulley cops issue new warning and threaten action over trolls and amateur detectives disrupting search,"POLICE investigating the disappearance of mum Nicola Bulley have issued a dispersal order to keep the public away from the area.  Cops received reports that amateur detectives from outside the village of St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, were filming close to residents' homes and sharing footage on social media. The order, which came into force at 8.40pm yesterday and lasts for at least 48 hours, gives officers extra powers to break up groups committing anti-social behaviour.  The force also threatened to take action over trolls making ""grossly offensive"" comments online. A Lancashire Police spokesperson said: ""We hope that will give people some reassurance that we will not tolerate criminality, including trespass and criminal damage. ""We are also aware of a number of grossly offensive comments being made on social media and elsewhere.  ""We are looking into these and will not hesitate to take action where appropriate."" Mum-of-two Nicola vanished on January 27 while walking her dog along the River Wyre.  Cops believe she fell into the icy water, sparking a huge search by specialist divers. They have already scoured the immediate area and are today searching Fleetwood where the river enters the Irish Sea.  It was confirmed today the hunt could lead police 20 miles to Morecambe Bay. A police spokesperson said: ""Our investigation into the disappearance of Nicola Bulley is continuing and we continue to search areas of the River Wyre and surrounding area. ""People may have seen less police activity today than previously in the area of the river above the weir but that is not because we have stepped down our searches, it is because the focus of the search has moved further downstream into the area of the river which becomes tidal and then out towards the sea."" Anyone with information should contact the force on 101 quoting log 0565 of January 30 and report immediate sightings by calling 999.

New Nicola Bulley lead as ‘tatty red van’ seen on the same day mum vanished as search extends 20 miles from home,"POLICE searching for missing mum Nicola Bulley could be trying to trace a ""tatty-looking"" red van parked close to where she vanished almost two weeks ago.  A worried resident spotted the suspicious-looking vehicle, believed to be a Renault, outside a barn in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, on January 27. The 55-year-old, who did not want to be named, reported it to cops on the day she disappeared and again on February 2, according to The Times.

""It could have been a Renault van. It was the sort of van you can live in."" Lancashire Police has not issued details about any vehicle but confirmed it investigating all reports. A spokesperson said: ""We have received a huge amount of information into the enquiry, all of which is being looked at, and we are extremely grateful to everyone who has assisted our investigation so far.""

"Workman crushed to death when pop-up urinal ‘dropped suddenly’ while he was doing repairs, inquest hears","A WORKMAN was crushed to death after a pop-up urinal ""dropped suddenly"", an inquest heard. Kevin Holding, 60, was killed by the device outside the Palace Theatre in Central London when it toppled over as he worked on it. Emergency services were unable to save him when they arrived on the afternoon of January 27. He was pronounced dead at 3.40pm that day, two hours after becoming trapped. A post-mortem examination revealed the cause of death to be asphyxiation due to compression. Kevin is understood to have started work on the device between 10am and 10.30am and was almost done when he became trapped just before 1pm. The inquest heard that emergency services rushed to the scene shortly after, but a vehicle capable of lifting the urinal didn't arrive until 3.15pm. Police reported that the horrifying moment the urinal fell was captured on chilling CCTV. The tragic engineer, who lived with his partner in Beckenham, South-East London, was identified by his Oyster card. Coroner Professor Fiona Wilcox opened and adjourned the inquest at a remote hearing at Inner West London Coroner's Court on February 9. She offered her ""very sincere condolences"" to Kevin's partner and three children, who were in attendance.  Pop-up urinals are stored underground and use a hydraulic mechanism to rise to street level at night. Westminster City Council introduced them around two decades ago to try and cut down on public urination. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21331442/workman-crushed-urinal-dropped-suddenly/

Big clothing and homeware chain to close multiple stores for good in weeks – is your local branch affected?,"A MAJOR clothing and homeware chain will close several stores this spring in the latest blow on the high street. TK Maxx has announced the closure of one of its own stores and two branches of Homesense. Homesense is a subsidiary of TK Maxx which exclusively sells homeware. First up, Edinburgh's TK Maxx will be forced to close this month after the landlord pulled the lease. The shop will close its doors to customers for the final time on   Wednesday, February 15. TK Maxx will also be shutting up shop in Manchester's Arndale Shopping Centre. The store will close on Wednesday, March 1, meaning customers wishing to visit the brand will have to venture further out of the city to the Trafford Centre. Swansea will also lose its Homesense store currently located at  Parc Fforestfach by the end of March. The closures at TK Maxx and Homesense come as the chain is set to open stores in several new locations. TK Maxx is opening a brand new store in Workington's former Debenhams as well as a new store in Llanelli. And Homesense will open a brand new store in Llanelli right beside the planned TK Maxx. TK Maxx hasn't yet confirmed when the new stores will open.  The retailer is a subsidiary of the TJX Companies which operates thousands of stores under the TJ Maxx brand in the United States.  TK Maxx has 352 stores in the UK and hundreds more operate under the same brand in Europe. The brand also owns 77 Homesense stores across England, Scotland, Wales and Norther Ireland. The company saw its annual turnover increase by 45% to £3.3billion in 2022 despite the challenges faced by the pandemic in previous years. The closures come as a number of other high-street retailers battle to keep their stores open. High inflation has pushed up costs for retailers and shoppers alike, while the pandemic encouraged more consumers to buy their goods online.  B&Q is set to close eight ""mini-shops"" located inside Asda supermarkets for good within weeks. House of Fraser is set to shut up shop in two locations as it battles to keep a presence on the high street. Last week it was announced clothing store M&Co will shut all 170 of its stores this year. The company fell into administration in December and the M&Co brand was bought by Yours Clothing. But only the M&Co branding was purchased - meaning the shops have not been saved. H&M recently confirmed to The Sun that two branches in Hartlepool and Isle of Wight are set to close. It hasn't given a date for when they will shut the doors for good or if workers are at risk of redundancy. It comes after the high street shop shuttered its branch in Burton and another in Maidenhead. New Look has also brought the shutters down on three of its stores in recent weeks. Its owner Sainsbury's also revealed that Lloyd's Pharmacy is withdrawing its services from over 200 Sainsbury's stores. Meanwhile, stationery chain Paperchase's 106 high street stores have launched closing down sales, though it hasn't been confirmed when they'll shut for good. Major burger chain Byron Burger also recently fell into administration and is set to close nine restaurants immediately. The owners of the chain said that the closures will result in the loss of 218 jobs. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/21329479/clothing-homeware-brand-closing-stores-tkmaxx-homesense/

I tracked down a homeless hero who handed in THOUSANDS in cash – his response when offered a reward was jaw-dropping,"THIS homeless man's selfless act has been praised by millions across the globe. The Canadian man shocked police when he handed in a suitcase discovered to have £1,223 cash into a police station. Constable Alex Bérubé of the West Shore Canadian National Police Service said when the gent showed up with the suitcase, he was touched. Bérubé said: ""He just remained very humble and said: 'You know what? I don't want that money, you can donate that money to food shelters'."" When word of the man's selfless act made headlines, a GoFundMe page was created to give the Langford man a reward. The police constable decided to track down the man after he turned in the suitcase and tell him about the money raised for his honest actions. Bérubé said: “After hearing this story and seeing how this case touched so many people, I took a personal interest in finding this man, looking for him everywhere while on and off shift. ""It's not easy tracking down a person of no fixed address and no phone, but I kept trying because I needed to tell him about how the community had rallied together to help him."" After Bérubé tracked him down and informed him of the money raised, the anonymous homeless man asked authorities to donate the money to charity instead. Bérubé said the man asked him to donate the GoFundMe money to a local charity, called Our Place Society. According to its website, Our Place Society is a community centre serving ""Greater Victoria's most vulnerable"", including working poor, impoverished elderly, mentally and physically challenged, addicted and the homeless.  The amazing organisation reportedly serves over 1000 free meals per day and provides hot showers, free clothing, and counselling. The man reportedly said that he was touched by the public's effort but what he really wanted was a job.  After hearing of the amazing story, journalist Mike Kelly began a job search to help the man. Kelly said: “Here is a man who is facing many challenges, yet despite that, he chose to do the right thing and see that another person wasn't left short thousands of dollars and facing the challenges that would bring them.  ""Now I'm going to do everything I can to help find him a job that fits his personal situation, and will hopefully move him closer to overcoming his current challenges.” The owner of the original lost suitcase full of money has also been identified. Bérubé commented: “It’s a gratifying part of our work when we can help do something for someone that has a positive impact on their life.""

When 61-year-old Dee Harkrider lost her wallet after a trip to Walmart, she didn't expect to find it again. 19-year-old Delivontae had parked at Walmart when he noticed a wallet sitting on a shopping cart.

Full list of firms hiking prices within weeks – how much will your bills rise?,"MILLIONS of TV, broadband and mobile customers will face higher bills in the next couple of months. Many telecoms providers increase their prices annually based on the rate of inflation plus an extra 3.9%. The current rate of inflation sits at 10.5%, so most bills will rise by 14.4% - however not all companies follow it exactly (see below). Most customers will see their bills increase from April 1, though some customers will see an increase as soon as next week. This means that if you pay your bill on the 10 of every month, you'll pay the increase from April 10. Customers still within their contract, or at least still their minimum term, can't do much about the hikes, though it's always worth haggling.  However, if you're out of contract you don't need to pay the extra price. It might be worth scouting around for a cheaper deal. We've got the full list of providers raising rates in April here. The ""majority"" of BT, EE and Plusnet customers will see a rise from March 31.  This includes broadband, landline, mobile and TV customers.  However, BT Home Essentials, EE Mobile Basics, Pay-As-You-Go, BT Basic and Home Phone Saver customers will see their prices frozen through 2023. The rise will affect customers even if they are signed up to a contract with a fixed price.  Based on the highest package we could find on the BT mobile website, you could be paying an extra £6.66 a month, or £78.92 a year. Impacted customers will see their bills increase from either April 1 or May 1 but Virgin will confirm which date yours will change on in an email. On average, Virgin Media cable customers will receive a price increase of an average of 13.8% - though this will be higher or lower depending on packages. For example, Virgin's Big Bundle package costs £29.99 a month. This means these customers will see a £50 a year increase to their bill. The price hike could mean customers will pay an extra £50 on bills. Virgin confirmed that vulnerable customers will not see a price change this year which includes those on the Essential Broadband packages. Sky mobile customers will see their bills increase by £1 a month, or an average of 9%. ""The majority"" of Sky's phone tariffs will increase, so you probably will see a rise. The hike will come into effect from February 14 - this means that if you pay your phone bill on the 20th of every month, you'll pay the extra amount from February 20. Those still in contract will not be affected. Today, the telecoms giant also announced that TV and broadband customers would pay more. Millions of broadband and TV customers will see their bills rise by an average of £67 a year from April. The increase will add 8.1% to bills annually, Sky said. Broadband customers will be able to leave for free if they are unhappy with the rise, while TV customers will have to pay a fee if they are still inside the minimum term of their contract. Broadband customers have 30 days to leave penalty-free. Shell customers will see bills go up  by 13.5% from April 1. For example, if you're paying £20 a month, you'd probably end up paying £21 a month once the change comes in. The hike will impact broadband and landline customers who signed up before Jan 9 this year. Those who signed up after should not be affected. If you're unhappy with the change, you won't be able to leave penalty-free. Three also confirmed that its 14.4% price rise will impact all new and upgrading customers, also from March 31. The increase will affect all Three customers who have taken out a contract since November 1. Of course, it depends what you pay now but the increase could mean you're paying more than £60 extra a year. The average monthly increase will be around £6 - those paying £32 will most likely pay £36.80. Similarly, TalkTalk customers will see their bills go up from April 1 too.  The provider will hike prices by 14.2%. How much extra you pay depends on what you're paying now but you could pay an extra £5 a month. If you think your bills are too high and want to drive them down, the first thing to do is find out what the cheapest deal on the market is. You can use this rate as a bargaining tool to get a better offer with your provider. Get in contact with your provider to see if they can match this rate - if not, you might want to switch instead. If you're mid-contract though and wish to leave, bear in mind that you could face an exit fee so check with your provider for any charges. Plus, it could be harder haggling with these prices as they come most years from all providers. For more ways to cut your phone bill, we've got eight tips for slashing costs.

Millions of cold weather payments worth £25 made this winter – how to check if you get the free cash,"MILLIONS of eligible households have already received a cold weather payment this winter.  The payments, worth £25, go out to homes when temperatures drop below zero degrees. Around five million homes have already received a cold weather payment this winter, according to Comparethemarket.  Altogether, £131million has been dished out across 112 postcodes between November 1, 2022 and February 3, 2023.  The scheme has been active from November 1 and will continue up until March 31, 2023. You get £25 for each seven-day period where the weather is below zero Celsius on average during this time frame. You can check if your area has had a cold weather payment by popping your postcode into the government's tool on its website. If every postcode was triggered, it's estimated about 3,714,000 Brits would be eligible for the payment. Ursula Gibbs, director at Comparethemarket said: “Cold weather conditions have significantly impacted several households this winter. An increasing number of cold weather snaps has increased the number of households eligible to receive cold weather payments from the DWP.  ""If you are eligible, we encourage you to claim the £25 you are entitled to. Energy bills have soared in the last year and this payment may help offset rising fuel costs during periods of extremely cold weather."" You can see a full list of postcodes eligible for cold weather payments in our guide here. But this is just for households within England and Wales, you won't get a cold weather payment in Scotland because the scheme has been replaced. Instead you might get an annual £50 Winter Heating Payment. You can find out more about the scheme on the Scottish Government website. You’re eligible for the cold weather payment scheme if you’re in receipt of one of the following benefits and meet certain criteria: Depending on your specific circumstances, you may also need to meet one or more of the following additional criteria: Regardless of employment, Universal Credit claimants are eligible if they have a disabled child amount in their claim. You can find out more about eligibility on the government's website. You don’t need to apply for the cold weather payment as it’s paid automatically to those who are eligible. The payments should arrive within 14 working days of the temperature dipping below zero degrees. The cash is paid into the same bank or building society account as the one used to pay benefits, and doesn’t affect any other allowances you may claim. If you don’t receive a payment and believe you’re eligible then you can tell your pension centre or Jobcentre Plus office, or call the Universal Credit helpline on 0800 328 5644. If you’re getting Universal Credit, you can also sign in to your account and add a note to your journal. If you go into hospital, this could affect your claim so make sure you tell someone using the contact details above. Low income households can get up to £150 towards their electricity bills with the government's warm home discount scheme.

"Serving Met Police officer, 40, appears in court charged with rape and assault against woman","A SERVING Met Police officer today appeared in court charged with rape. PC Jorden Brown is accused of a string of offences relating to one woman. The 40-year-old, who is attached to the Central East Command Unit, appeared at Barkingside Magistrates' Court today.

Watch terrifying moment thug brandishes huge MACHETE in wild street brawl involving ‘Deliveroo driver’,"TERRIFYING footage has emerged of a thug brandishing a huge machete during a street brawl with bystanders. The yob wielded the long blade as a crowd of helmet-clad moped drivers clashed in Kingstanding, Birmingham, on February 8. A clip of the horrifying fight was posted on social media and shows the man swinging the knife at others and just narrowly missing. It appears that some of those involved in the altercation are on his side, with one of them using what appears to be a length of wood to batter his opponents. The group fighting the thugs, including someone who appeared to be a Deliveroo driver, chased them away to some nearby shops. Some of the attackers fled on foot, while one used a white moped to drive off. Witnesses were left in fear and disgust, with one saying they were ""appalled"" by the violent outburst in broad daylight, adding that children could have been walking home from school. It is not known what caused the clash, but reports suggest it involved the attempted theft of a motorbike. In the video, one of the men can be seen kicking over a line of mopeds, before running off with the machete-wielding yob. Moon Baba, who presumably filmed the clip, posted it to Facebook with the caption: ""Every day in Birmingham."" A spokesperson for West Midlands Police told Birmingham Live: ""We were called to reports of disorder where weapons were brandished in Warren Farm Road at just after 4pm on February 8.  ""No-one is known to have been injured and enquiries are continuing."" Deliveroo have been contacted for comment. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21333494/terrifying-machete-street-brawl-deliveroo/
Nicola Bulley diving expert reveals video ‘proof’ she didn’t fall into the river where cops claim she vanished,"A DIVING expert who led a search for Nicola Bulley claims he has video ""proof"" she did not fall in the river. Nicola, 45, was last seen in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, at around 9.15am on January 27. Police believe she fell in the River Wyre while walking her dog Willow. Dive expert Peter Faulding says a clip shows the river is slow-moving, which means she would have sunk ""very quickly"". He claims this means Nicola, 45, would have remained near where she disappeared on January 27 if she'd fallen in. The forensic expert also says the missing mum could have simply ""stood up"" in the water as rocks at the time were under just 2ft of water. Peter claims this means Nicola did not fall in the river as police believe. He has now urged officers to carry out a ""wider land search"" of outbuildings and sheds as the hunt enters its 13th day. Speaking about the video, Peter said: ""The log stayed at that point for 20 minutes, and it actually spiralled and went up six feet and came back to the same place. ""The river on the day was slightly higher - it was about a foot higher - but I'd be very surprised in my experience [if she was there] as a body usually goes to the bottom very quickly. ""If Nicola slipped down the bank, she would have landed in about 2ft of water but onto rocks, and she could have stood up."" Peter, who runs Specialist Group International (SGI), led a sonar search for the mum in the river. But the group later called off the search with the expert saying they have done all they can to try and find the missing mum. He was yesterday pictured visiting the scene where Nicola was last seen with her partner Paul Ansell. Peter claims Paul now believes ""Nicola has not gone in that river"" after speaking with the diving experts. He said: ""He's very upset and he was in tears yesterday. He's very emotional, obviously. ""He was shocked at how shallow the rocks were yesterday. He thought it was really deep there. If she had gone in she would have landed on the rocks. ""The family thanked us for being here. They said 'You've given us confidence now' and his belief is that Nicola has not gone in that river."" Peter's comments comes as police moved their search 20 miles away to Morecambe Bay. Specialist teams have been seen searching the sea today with officers confirming they are focusing on the mouth of the river. Lancashire Police suggested finding Nicola ""in the open sea becomes more of a possibility"". They said previously their “main working hypothesis” is that Nicola had “sadly fallen in the river”. Nicola has been described as white, 5ft 3ins tall with light-brown shoulder-length hair. She was last seen wearing an ankle-length black quilted gilet jacket with a black Engelbert Strauss waist-length coat underneath and black tight-fitting jeans. She had long green walking socks tucked into her jeans, ankle-length green Next wellies, a necklace and a pale blue Fitbit on. Nicola has an Essex accent and links to the Thornton-Cleveleys area near Blackpool. Anybody with information about where she might be is asked to call 101, quoting log 473 of January 27, or ring 999 for immediate sightings.

Tory Party row erupts as Red Wall MPs want return of death penalty – but Rishi Sunak does NOT support executions,"RISHI Sunak has distanced himself from calls to bring back the death penalty after his new Tory deputy said the worst murderers should be executed. But the intervention pitted him against several Red Wall MPs who today agreed with Lee Anderson that the most evil criminals must pay the ultimate price. Within days of being promoted to deputy party chairman the Ashfield MP caused controversy with an impassioned case for capital punishment. He told the Spectator: “Nobody has ever committed a crime after being executed. You know that, don't you? 100 per cent success rate.” The death penalty was abolished in 1969, with the last hanging happening in 1964.  The PM yesterday distanced himself from the remarks, insisting: “That’s not my view, that’s not the Government’s view. “But we are united in the Conservative Party in wanting to be absolutely relentless in bearing down on crime and making sure people are safe and feel safe.” Yet he was hit by a party uprising as fellow Tories swung behind Mr Anderson’s hardline stance. Declaring his support for the death penalty, Bassetlaw MP Brendan Clarke-Smith said: “For many of us there will be some crimes where a prison sentence simply doesn’t seem enough.” Pointing to polling showing public support, he added: “It therefore seems strange that support for capital punishment is portrayed by many in the public eye as being some sort of extreme and minority held opinion.  “In reality, this couldn’t be further from the truth. In fact, you could say Lee’s view is the mainstream one.” Mansfield MP Ben Bradley was “pretty confident that the vast majority in communities I represent would be quite happy to see a death penalty available for the most heinous crimes”.  The Red Waller told the Sun: “The outrage that some London Liberal commentators have expressed to what Lee said just reinforces how out of touch they are with the country north of Watford.”  Another piled in: "" As much as sections of the establishment might try and pretend Lee’s view is a fringe view, it isn’t. It’s a view shared by millions."" Tory MP Nickie Aitken, Mr Anderson’s co-deputy, piled in: “If the intelligentsia want to go on and criticise him - basically if they criticise Lee for his views, they are criticising a huge swathe of his constituents.” Cabinet Minister Penny Mordaunt also refused to criticise Mr Anderson in the Commons yesterday, praising him for standing up for his voters. Mr Anderson, a former miner and Labour councillor, also railed against Britain’s asylum system and said small boat migrants should be sent back the “same day”. He said: “I'd put them on a Royal Navy frigate or whatever and sail it to Calais, have a stand-off. And they'd just stop coming.” Yesterday he doubled down his view that illegal immigration was the “number one” issue but said he respected “collective responsibility” and would be making his case “behind closed doors”.  Meanwhile Mr Anderson courted further controversy following an on-air spat with a BBC radio presenter. Downing Street insisted the Tory deputy did not speak for the Government and was a political appointee.  ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/21334401/tory-party-execution-row/
Who is former Labour MP Jared O’Mara?,"FORMER Labour MP Jared O'Mara appeared in court to answer for fraudulent claims during his tenure.  Appearing for sentencing, the ex-Sheffield Hallam MP was found guilty and given four years in prison. Jared O'Mara was born in Sheffield on November 15, 1981. Prior to becoming an MP, he had held a position as a school governor. He had also volunteered for some local charities during this time. This was before he then decided to pursue a career in politics. O'Mara was found guilty of six counts of fraud totalling £52,000 of the taxpayer's money as a result of bogus claims. These all stemmed from a fictitious charity called Confident About Autism South Yorkshire.  Due to the position he held at the time, it was deemed that he had undermined public trust and the image held of MPs by the general public. In his court case, it was documented that O'Mara had made the claims to fund a heavy cocaine habit and had got himself into debt with drug dealers. He was found guilty of fraud by false representation. Having stood as a Labour candidate in various Sheffield council elections, it came as a surprise to many when he was to dislodge Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats in a shock result on June 8, 2017. However, a number of comments made by O'Mara prior to his election win came to light which led the Labour party to investigate these allegations although they decided not to suspend him at this point. O'Mara was later to be suspended from the party and did not speak publicly for a number of months following this. When he finally did, he announced he would be taking a leave of absence on the advice of his GP. He was readmitted to the Labour party in 2018, when as a result of their investigations they decided to issue him a formal warning along with a mandatory requirement to attend training programmes. Later that year he was to announce that he was quitting the party to become an independent, claiming the party did not share his commitment to ""the true definition of equality and compassion."" He stood down as an MP in December 2019 following his arrest by police. While he was found guilty of six of the charges made against him, he was cleared of another two. After the case, CPS boss Nick Price said: “O’Mara viewed taxpayers’ money as a source of income that was his to claim and use as he wished.”   ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21332787/who-is-former-labour-mp-jared-omara/

High Street chain to make major change to menus – and shoppers will love it,"A HIGH street chain has announced a new menu option, and customers will be buzzing.  It will be adding meal deals to its menu from February 15.  Fast food chain LEON is introducing a £3.99 meal deal to stores next week.  The restaurant, which prides itself in healthy food and a vast menu, will be adding two rice pots to its All Day menu.  Customers can choose between two flavours, a BBQ Chicken or Black Bean Chilli rice pot, and pair it with a drink for £3.99. The drinks included in the deal are below, alongside usual prices: On its own, the BBQ Chicken pot would set you back £3.49 while the Black Bean Chilli costs £2.99. So if you bought the BBQ Chicken pot alongside a bottle of Trip CBD Infusion, you'd save a maximum £1.49.  Glenn Edwards, managing director of LEON Restaurants, said:“LEON is committed to its founding mission that our food should taste good, do you good and be kind to the planet.  ""We always aim to serve naturally fast food made with the best quality ingredients for the most reasonable price, and the launch of the rice pots deal is another way to ensure this.  ""We will continue to check in with our valued guests and respond to their feedback as it will only help us to bring accessible, well-loved dishes and innovations to our menu.” If you opt for a BBQ Chicken rice pot, you'll get Italian brown rice topped with chargrilled chicken thigh, garlic aioli, barbeque sauce, mint and parsley. The Black Bean Chilli is the vegan option, taken from a traditional Brazilian feijoada. It also includes Italian brown rice, this time flavoured with black beans, carrots and onions spiced with sweet and smoked paprika and oregano. The change will be implemented across LEON's 80 stores in the UK and the Netherlands.  You can find your nearest branch using the store locator on its website.  Elsewhere, Pret A Manger has launched a range of budget sandwiches in a bid to tackle rising costs. The range includes eight new Made Simple options which went on sale last month, starting at £2.54 for an egg mayo. There is also a BLT, tuna and cucumber, mature cheddar and pickle, chicken salad, ham salad, and hummus and veg — all for £2.99. The prices are a big drop from Pret’s upmarket products — with a posh cheddar and pickle baguette costing £5.45 and even an egg mayo sandwich usually selling for £3.40. However, it's still no cheaper than other lunch deals.  Greggs, for instance, sells a £2.75 tuna crunch baguette. It also offers a range of meal deals, the cheapest of which being a breakfast deal for £2.60.  The breakfast deal means you can sink your teeth into a filled roll with any hot drink. Or a bottle of orange juice, if you'd rather. Elsewhere,  Tesco offers a £3.90 deal, including a sandwich, drink and snack. It's even cheaper for Clubcard members at £3.40. Boots also offers a £3.59 meal deal in UK stores outside of London, although inside the capital it's £4.19. But that's a whopping £4.70 saving, of course if you buy a chicken triple sandwich for £3.35, a trek power millionaire shortbread for £2.25 and a vita coco natural coconut water 500ml for £2.69. We tried other supermarket meal deals and rounded up which saved you the most money - you can read about it in our piece here.

Major Android update tackles hidden ‘space killer’ with super easy trick,"GOOGLE has snuck in a way to get rid of 'bloatware' to help make Android smartphones run faster. Bloatware is software installed by a phones carrier or device manufacturer. None of it is needed for the phone to work properly, so it can be removed without worrying about your phone.  But this feature is currently hidden away behind a developer flag - meaning it's only accessible to developers so far.  Google launched the developer preview of Android 14 last night.  This means developers can can a sneak preview of Google's upcoming Android software.  Google introduced Android 13 to its phones in August last year.  But the tech giant is already working on Android 14, the next software system above it.  And in it is a new option to see ""apps installed in the background"", XDA reported.  The feature is currently sat inside an in-development version of the Settings app called ""Spa"".  The Spa is also gated behind a developer flag. The select few with access to the preview have revealed that when you open the menu, users will see a description saying, ""your device manufacturer may install apps on your device in the background, or allow your carrier and other partners to do so.""  That page will list any apps that were installed in the background without your knowledge, and it would let you uninstall them easily. These bloatware apps can clog up storage, causing your phone to act slower than normal.  But freeing up that space could give Android devices a new lease of life once it's officially rolled out.

"Ukraine must defeat Putin or every Nato country is at risk from Russia, warns top soldier on Brit war games","UKRAINE must defeat Vladimir Putin or every Nato country could face the wrath of Russia, a top soldier has warned. Estonian colonel Andrus Merilo issued the chilling message as he spoke on the sidelines of Nato war games just 80 miles from Russia.  The icy exercises are an annual event – but have taken on a sinister new importance since Putin attacked Ukraine almost a year ago on February 24. With the spectre of the conflict hanging over them, the soldiers from Britain, Estonia, France, and Denmark are all united and dutifully carrying out their drills.  Speaking to The Sun Online as his forces carried out intense trench warfare exercises, Colonel Merilo described the herculean effort by the Ukrainians against Putin as a ""small miracle"".  Russia is just a stone's throw away from the training ground, and the Estonian troops are constantly aware of the possible threat posed by an increasingly belligerent Putin. Colonel Merilo said the next two months will be decisive as the Ukraine war rumbles on.   He told The Sun Online: ""Ukraine has to win this war, there is no alternative, or any NATO nation is at risk. ""It is now very clear that Russia is a threat to its neighbours. ""What we need is more readiness and communication towards the Russians that Nato is more than capable of holding them off."" Speaking directly about Putin, Colonel Merilo simply described Vlad's war as a ""massive miscalculation"".  ""It will be the end of his regime,"" he said. Estonian defence minister Hanno Pevkur warned it's ""vital"" that Ukraine succeeds in its fight against Putin.  Speaking to The Sun Online, he said: ""My message to Putin is to go out from Ukraine. It is not his land.  ""Ukrainians are not just fighting their own land, they are fighting for the free world, for international law, for all of us.  ""It is vital that they succeed."" He went on: ""The Ukrainians have shown courage. They are fighting for their own country, their own families, so their motivation is 200 times that of their invaders.  ""We see the predictions that Ukraine's defence last wasn't right, they will do what they can to defend their country."" Ukrainians are not just fighting their own land, they are fighting for the free world The minister praised the relationship his nation has with Nato - and especially with the UK - in the face of the threat from Russia.  He said while they ""can't choose"" who their neighbour is - they can make sure they are prepared for anything, including being ready to fight at very short notice. He warned Russia would face an army that would be ready for action in just two hours if they ever attacked Estonia.  ""We have been prepared for the possibility of an invasion for some time,"" Pevkur explained. ""Obviously, we will do everything we can to protect ourselves, together with our allies. ""This is why we said some time ago, 'Never Alone Again'.  ""This is why we are in Nato and the EU. We all believe and trust that the Nato umbrella is working quickly."" Pevkur went on: ""We are very quick. We have trained a lot. We have our reserve army so that we can defend ourselves. ""Building up our division means we will have more readiness. Last week we carried out snap exercises where we can be ready in just two hours. ""In 24 hours we could have considerable numbers of troops ready."" He explained the biggest challenge facing them - is simply one of space, with Ukraine being twice the size of Estonia.  ""We don't have the luxury to give even one metre, so we will start fighting from the first metre,"" Pevkur said. Estonian forces alongside their Nato allies carrying out exercises called WINTER CAMP 23 as they drill to work on the readiness of Nato’s Forward Presence Battlegroup. Temperatures in Keskpolügoon, or the Central Training Area, are expected to drop to around -12C as they carry out the war games this week. On the vast military base, about the size of 15,000 football pitches – the troops from all nations are being put through their paces. The war continues to rumble on in Ukraine, with fears of a possible new Russian offensive being launched to mark the first anniversary of the invasion.  Pevkur said the annual exercises are ""very important"" - and hailed Estonia's relationship with the UK. He said: ""UK has been one of Estonia's biggest allies, you are the lead country for us. This relationship is extremely important.  ""Even when you go back 100 years, Brits were here when we had our first war of independence."" And he laid out how his nation's military is tooling up in the face of threat from Russia, getting their hands on new missiles, guns, armoured vehicles and plenty of ammo.  ""Last year, we acquired two times more ammunition than we did in the past 30 years,"" he told The Sun Online.  ""Estonia has been prepared [since] before the Russian invasion of Ukraine."" Nato nations have been providing Ukraine with weapons and armour to defend their country against the Russians. But many in Kyiv fear it is not enough - especially with reports as many as 500,000 Russian soldiers could be preparing for a spring offensive. President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned the war is going to get more challenging - and has continues to urge the West to help him arm his troops. Putin has managed to turn Russia into a pariah state since the start of the war - with his list of allies dwindling. And his future is believed to be tied to the war's success or failure. Putin has been warned he could face an internal uprising unless he manages to achieve something in Ukraine. He had foolishly expected to steamroller Ukraine and for his soldiers to be welcomed as ""liberators"" - but they have faced a fierce fightback. Cities initially seized by the Russians were then retaken by the Ukrainians. But after a near stalemate over the winter, its believed Vlad may be preparing a hammer blow to try to win the war - and save his own skin. The fiercest of the fighting is currently focused on the city of Bakhmut. It is devolving into the bloodiest battle of the war so far with a life expectancy of soldiers on the frontline reportedly being just being just four hours. With the first anniversary of the war fast approaching, the next few months could make or break both the conflict and the future of the international order on the world's stage.

Jailed Andrew Tate brags about his seized Bugatti and being ‘most Googled man’ in latest bizarre rant from behind bars,"ANDREW Tate has bragged about his Bugatti, which is set to be seized by cops, in a bizarre rant from jail. The 36-year-old misogynist influencer also boasts about being the “most Googled man” as he remains behind bars accused of sex trafficking and rape. Prosecutors want to take control of the Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport along with a property on the exclusive artificial island of Palm Jumeirah in Dubai, sources told The Sun Online. In response he bragged: “Everybody wishes they were me when I'm in my Bugatti.” Tate went on to claim he is the “the most googled man on the planet” adding ""without a reaction"" in his regular newsletter to subscribers from bars. Tate's prized Bugatti is one of just 60 such cars in the world, being capable of going from 0 to 60mph in just 2.4 seconds with a top speed of 305mph. It is regarded as one of the fastest, most expensive and luxurious supercars in the world. The Bugatti is the same one which he used to taunt eco-activist Greta Thunberg, in which shared pictures of himself with a pizza on Twitter came just days before he was arrested. Tate's money and his assets are being chased down by Romanian organised crime-busting cops, DIICOT, as part of the wide-ranging probe. Some £6million worth of supercars - including a Rolls Royce, Aston Martin and Lamborghini - have already been seized from his compound in Romania. Romanian police are seizing the assets pending the criminal investigation and should Tate be convicted, it is believed they will be auctioned off. It comes as an X Factor singer has revealed she ""dodged a bullet"" after matching with Andrew Tate on Tinder. Janet Devlin, who rose to fame on the eight series of the show in 2011, revealed she exchanged numbers with the disgraced media personality. ""He had my number, I think we exchanged numbers, and he called me and I stayed on this phone call,” the 28-year-old explained on the Sly Guy Podcast with comedian Dave Elliot. ""I can't remember anything that was said I just remember being like, ugh, icky vibe. I just got the ick.” Meanwhile, a woman who worked as a web cam girl for Tate alleged he strangled her until she passed out. The woman, who’s now helping the prosecution, told the BBC she was approached “completely out of the blue” by Tate on Facebook. Tate said he wanted her to be his girlfriend and persuaded her to visit him in Romania then to work as a webcam girl. But she said Tate became increasingly controlling, fining her if out without his permission and he then became violent. The woman - who was given the pseudonym Sophie by the BBC - explained that “most of the violence was sexual. She said ""that's obviously something that he's into” and “used to strangle me, to the point where I passed out”. Sophie even described how she was pressured to get a tattoo of Tate's name on her arm. The Tates have now hired as their lawyer Tina Glandian, who has represented disgraced stars Chris Brown, Mike Tyson and Jussie Smollett. Andrew and Tristan Tate both deny all allegations against them. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21326272/andrew-tate-brags-seized-bugatti-most-googled-man/
New salary for MPs revealed as politicians get a pay rise while teachers and nurses strike over salary,"MPs are set to rake in an extra £2,440 per year. The independent pay body for politicians will hike salaries by 2.9% from April 1. It will bring overall MPs' salaries from £84,144 to an eye-catching £86,584. The below-inflation hike is on par with average pay rises for the public sector last year. But it's sparked fury among tax justice campaigners who say “politicians’ pay should not be pegged to generous public sector rises"". And it comes as thousands of nurses, ambulance workers, rail staff and teachers have threatened to continue striking over pay and working conditions.  Unions want inflation busting hikes of over 10%. But Rishi Sunak insists that's unaffordable and would only make inflation worse.  John O’Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: “Working taxpayers will wonder why MPs' pay is going up in these tough times.  “Politicians’ pay should not be pegged to generous public sector rises.   “Parliament should instead introduce performance-related pay for politicians.” Defending the hike, Richard Lloyd, Chair of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, added: “In confirming MPs pay for next year, we have once again considered very carefully the extremely difficult economic circumstances, the government’s evolving approach to public sector pay in the light of forecasted rates of inflation, and the principle that MPs’ pay should be reflective of their responsibility in our democracy. “Our aim is to ensure that pay is fair for MPs, regardless of their financial circumstances, to support the most diverse of parliaments. "" Serving as an MP should not be the preserve of those wealthy enough to fund it themselves."" News of a pay rise comes as MPs could return to pandemic-style remote working in September. Commons authorities are mulling forcing politicians to work from home so they can repair the crumbling Westminster Palace.

Tory Party row erupts as Red Wall MPs want return of death penalty – but Rishi Sunak does NOT support executions,"RISHI Sunak has distanced himself from calls to bring back the death penalty after his new Tory deputy said the worst murderers should be executed. But the intervention pitted him against several Red Wall MPs who today agreed with Lee Anderson that the most evil criminals must pay the ultimate price. Within days of being promoted to deputy party chairman the Ashfield MP caused controversy with an impassioned case for capital punishment. He told the Spectator: “Nobody has ever committed a crime after being executed. You know that, don't you? 100 per cent success rate.” The death penalty was abolished in 1969, with the last hanging happening in 1964.  The PM yesterday distanced himself from the remarks, insisting: “That’s not my view, that’s not the Government’s view. “But we are united in the Conservative Party in wanting to be absolutely relentless in bearing down on crime and making sure people are safe and feel safe.” Yet he was hit by a party uprising as fellow Tories swung behind Mr Anderson’s hardline stance. Declaring his support for the death penalty, Bassetlaw MP Brendan Clarke-Smith said: “For many of us there will be some crimes where a prison sentence simply doesn’t seem enough.” Pointing to polling showing public support, he added: “It therefore seems strange that support for capital punishment is portrayed by many in the public eye as being some sort of extreme and minority held opinion.  “In reality, this couldn’t be further from the truth. In fact, you could say Lee’s view is the mainstream one.” Mansfield MP Ben Bradley was “pretty confident that the vast majority in communities I represent would be quite happy to see a death penalty available for the most heinous crimes”.  The Red Waller told the Sun: “The outrage that some London Liberal commentators have expressed to what Lee said just reinforces how out of touch they are with the country north of Watford.”  Another piled in: "" As much as sections of the establishment might try and pretend Lee’s view is a fringe view, it isn’t. It’s a view shared by millions."" Tory MP Nickie Aitken, Mr Anderson’s co-deputy, piled in: “If the intelligentsia want to go on and criticise him - basically if they criticise Lee for his views, they are criticising a huge swathe of his constituents.” Cabinet Minister Penny Mordaunt also refused to criticise Mr Anderson in the Commons yesterday, praising him for standing up for his voters. Mr Anderson, a former miner and Labour councillor, also railed against Britain’s asylum system and said small boat migrants should be sent back the “same day”. He said: “I'd put them on a Royal Navy frigate or whatever and sail it to Calais, have a stand-off. And they'd just stop coming.” Yesterday he doubled down his view that illegal immigration was the “number one” issue but said he respected “collective responsibility” and would be making his case “behind closed doors”.  Meanwhile Mr Anderson courted further controversy following an on-air spat with a BBC radio presenter. Downing Street insisted the Tory deputy did not speak for the Government and was a political appointee.  ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/21334401/tory-party-execution-row-erupts/
Nicola Bulley’s friends say locals feel ‘unsafe’ as amateur detectives descend on area and hamper police search team,"NICOLA Bulley's friends say locals feel ""unsafe"" as amateur detectives descend on the area she went missing.  Police also warned the same people were hampering their efforts to find the missing mum.  The disappearance of Nicola has taken the nation and world by storm, with social media being flooded with theories.  But many have even taken to foot around where the 45-year-old vanished.  Now one of the mum-of-two's pals has said the amateur detectives are actually ""doing the complete opposite"" of helping find her.  Friend Heather Gibbons said such actions needed to stop as they were also frightening residents in the Lancashire town.  It came as amateur detectives were warned off doing their own searching of an ""abandoned house"" - which was actually lived in by a ""lovely family"".  Heather, who said she was a pal of ""Nikki's"", wrote on Facebook: ""Tonight multiple police units are out in St Michaels dealing with people trespassing, not only on this families land but also others. ""We are at the point where people coming to 'help' look for Nikki in this way is actually doing the complete opposite. ""You're taking police time and resources away from the investigation. ""You're letting speculation take away from the actual facts. ""We are at the point where this type of 'help' is making people who live in St Michaels feel unsafe. ""Please don't let this continue to happen.""  It comes as another pal begged trolls to stop slinging ""disgusting"" accusations at Nicola's partner Paul Anesll.  They said lurid theories have surrounded the chilling case since the mum vanished in St Michael's on Wyre on January 27. Friends said they had now been forced to defend Paul, after web sleuths suggested he was involved. Yesterday, the heartbroken partner visited the site Nicola was last seen.

We found a wallet bursting with cash – We returned it anonymously but CCTV meant we got an incredible reward,"A VETERAN tracked down the two teens who anonymously returned his wallet filled with cash to offer them an even bigger reward.  Marc Walsh had thought his wallet was long lost to the snowy Detroit streets, before it was found by the 14-year-old Vincent sisters who were later caught on his CCTV returning it. ""Really heartbroken, I really didn't know what to do,"" Walsh told Fox 2 News. The disabled Marine Corps veteran had dropped his wallet filled with cash, credit cards and his military ID somewhere on the street in Detroit's West Side.  He never imagined he would see it again. However, Makhia and Makyla Vincent stumbled across the prized item on their walk to school. They saw the military ID and instantly knew they had to return it - their grandfather was a veteran too.  ""I read the veterans card and I was like I would hate if that was my granddad and that happened to him so I knew we had to return it,"" Makyla explained.  Walsh didn't know who the kind strangers were, but his home CCTV captured the moment they returned it.  The veteran was so touched by the kind gesture, he reached out to a news outlet to help track them down.  The news of their selfless act quickly spread. ""All of the sudden we were all over the news and people are saying thank you for turning it in and everything, it was great,"" Makhia said.  After being united with his the girls, Walsh rewarded them with $200 and told them: ""I'm so incredibly grateful, so grateful and humbled"".  The sisters said they ""knew"" they had to do the right thing and Walsh responded: ""It renews my faith in humanity, it really does.""  Overjoyed at their new haul, the girls said they would spend a little, but make sure to save most of it.  In Canada, another sweet story has emerged of a homeless man who returning thousands of pounds worth of cash. The man had found a suitcase stuffed with cash worth £1,223 and handed it to police to track down its owner or give it to charity.  Inspired by the story, a GoFundMe page was set up to reward his selfless act, but after the man was found he asked for it to be given to charity instead.  Elsewhere, a Ghanaian taxi driver tracked down a local fishmonger to return £570 worth of cash she had left it in his cab.

Your landlord will be hit with new rules to remove mould from your home in new laws after Awaab Ishak’s tragic death,"SHAMELESS landlords will face unlimited fines for failing to fix mouldy homes within strict new deadlines. Michael Gove is introducing “Awaab’s Law” after tragic toddler Awaab Ishak died in a damp Rochdale flat. Tough rules forcing landlords to urgently repair dangerous buildings will be written into tenancy agreements so renters can take court action. The Housing Secretary said: “The tragic death of Awaab Ishak should never have happened. He was inexcusably let down and his family repeatedly ignored. “Those landlords who continue to drag their feet over dangerous damp and mould will face the full force of the law.” Ministers have continued to block funding to Rochdale Boroughwide Housing over the scandal. Two-year-old Awaab’s father Faisal Abdullah repeatedly complained to the landlord about mould and damp before the tot’s death in December 2020. CEO Gareth Swarbrick was sacked last November following an investigation into the tragedy.  Mr Abdullah said last night: “We would like to express our thanks to Michael Gove and his team for listening to us and doing the right thing. “My wife and I still struggle to deal with this loss of our son, but we are finally starting to feel like we are being treated fairly. ""We hope that Awaab's Law will help stop any other family going through the pain we have gone through. We would not wish this pain on anybody.""

I love my city but it’s been voted one of the worst places to live in the UK – here’s why,"A RESIDENT has said they still love their city despite it being voted as one of the worst places to live in the UK. The survey by ILiveHere found out which cities were bottom of the heap in terms of quality of life for locals. The North and Midlands bore the brunt of local dissatisfaction, with the majority of the top 50 in those regions. While Luton took the took spot, Birmingham was not far behind. It was voted as the 14th worst place to live in England. And one woman has said that her city is still full of ""heart, creativity and wonder"" despite the problems. She told Birmingham Live: ""Price hikes are impacting everything from our council tax the amount we pay to cremate our dead.  ""That coupled with the fact that those responsible for the city are repeatedly letting people down with rubbish housing. ""It wouldn't surprise me at all to see the anger, the disappointment and the sadness that Brummies feel is being demonstrated on a site like iLiveHere.  ""I don't like it, but I get it. The thing is, despite all of the factors that are threatening to crush out our light. ""It is still burning, a little hidden sometimes but incandescent under the horrible circumstances that so many Brummies are facing. Our city is full of heart, creativity and wonder."" In the rest of the survey, Peterborough came in second, closely followed by the nation's most densely populated city, Portsmouth, despite its picturesque harbour. Slough and Aylesbury rounded out the top five, based on audience surveys and public votes. Bizarrely, Reading appears twice on the list - in 21st and 12th place. Lovers of Northampton might feel stung as it only just snuck onto the list in 50th place. London boroughs seem to have avoided the wrath of the public as only four appear on the list. Hounslow, Barking and Dagenham and Croydon are all on there, though none higher than 19th. Perhaps surprisingly, Kensington and Chelsea comes out worst in the capital, in 15th, despite being home to streets of luxury shops and restaurants catering to millionaire residents. Some social media commenters, though, were less generous than the official rankings, suggesting that ""all of England"" should be placed in the top spot. It comes as one Birmingham area was described as Britain's ""worst"" cul-de-sac by terrified residents. The crime hotspot in a deprived area sees scared locals stay in after dark and prepare for the worst.  ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21335691/love-my-city-worst-places-live/
"Family sue school after boy, 7, suffers horrific burns when his sheep outfit catches fire at play","A FAMILY have sued a school after a seven-year-old boy suffered horrific burns when his sheep outfit caught fire at a nativity play. Three years ago, the boy was dressed in a costume made of cotton wool balls when another pupil, holding a lighted candle in a plastic cup, tripped and set fire to the outfit. His parents watched on in horror as the blaze engulfed their son during the carol concert and nativity presentation at Our Lady of the Annunciation Church in Croydon, London, a High Court claim says. Headteacher Noel Campbell and a woman rushed to pat him down to put out the fire, and the child was airlifted to hospital. But he suffered catastrophic burns covering 45 per cent of his body, including his neck, face, body and arms. The boy and his parents accuse the school of negligence and are now suing St Thomas Becket Catholic Primary School for damages of more than £1million.  His mother and father, who were in the audience, claim they suffered psychiatric injuries as a result of witnessing the accident to their son. Both Mr Campbell and the woman were also injured, reports Mail Online. The father is claiming more than £100,000, and his mother over £50,000 for their personal injuries after witnessing the distressing event. They are also seeking provisional damages for their son, allowing them to return to court to seek more money if his condition deteriorates and he develops skeletal or joint deformity, and infection of scar tissue, either spontaneously or caused by surgery. All three are also seeking damages for future disadvantage on the open labour market. Procedural judge Master Brown granted an anonymity order protecting the identities of the boy and his parents meaning they cannot be named. There were around twenty other year 3 children in the corridor near the stage, with each child holding lighted candles in plastic cups, the court will hear. London Fire Brigade’s assistant commissioner for fire safety Dan Daly said: ""This horrific accident is a stark reminder of the risk real candles can pose. ""They are a completely unnecessary hazard when it comes to children and school plays. ""Sadly this isn’t the first time we have seen clothing and costumes set alight by candles and people need to recognise the risk and prevent these incidents from happening again.” The claim was issued by Benjamin Rogers of Stewarts Law. Solicitors Weightmans are acting for the school. St Thomas Becket Catholic Primary School have been contacted for comment.

"Ukraine needs our help more than ever against evil Putin, so why are USA and Germany so shamefully losing their bottle?","We’re at the useful idiot stage of the Ukraine war. That’s the moment when supposedly intelligent people expose themselves as easily manipulated, hideously gullible propaganda tools so that evil can prosper. Take Pink Floyd rock star Roger Waters, who inexplicably addressed the UN Security Council this week to condemn the ‘provocateurs in the strongest possible terms.’ He wasn’t talking about Vladimir Putin and his genocidal barbarians - he was talking about those who had supposedly ‘provoked’ Putin into illegally invading a sovereign democratic country and slaughtering tens of thousands of innocent people. Watch Piers Morgan Uncensored weekdays on Sky 526, Virgin Media 606, Freeview 237, Freesat 217 or on Fox Nation in the US ‘The only sensible course of action today is to call for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine,’ said Waters, who appeared at the invitation of Russia, and wouldn’t know a sensible course of action if it smacked him over his deluded, blinkered head. Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN promptly lambasted him, saying: ‘How sad for his former fans to see him accepting the role of just a brick in the wall, a wall of Russian disinformation and propaganda.’ I’d have substituted the letter ‘b’ for a ‘p.’ But what a fading nutty old musical has-been says about this war is of trivial irrelevance, moronic though Waters is. Far more disconcerting is the language currently being deployed by leaders of two major nations – Germany and America. I sense that most dangerous of things in a war: a wobble. The German chancellor Olaf Scholz, already so shamefully slow to supply desperately needed German battle tanks, has now rejected President Zelensky’s urgent plea for fighter jets, saying he won’t be drawn into a ‘public bidding war’ over military support for Ukraine ‘according to the principle of battle tanks, submarines, battleships, who can offer more. Germany won’t get involved.’ What a dismal response from one of Europe’s most powerful countries. Equally disappointing was US President Biden’s decision to barely mention Ukraine in his annual State of the Union address on Tuesday night. Last year, six days after the invasion, he devoted a large swathe of it to ripping into Putin and received lengthy and unanimous bipartisan standing ovations for his defiant rhetoric. This year, he spent less than two minutes discussing Ukraine and when he asked whether Americans would ‘stand for the defence of democracy’ against ‘tyranny’, I was appalled to see numerous members of the US Congress declining to stand up in agreement. Both Scholz and Biden are facing growing domestic resistance to supporting the Ukrainian war effort, but that kind of war fatigue is to be expected now it’s dragging on longer than anyone predicted. What should not be expected is for these leaders to lose their bottle. The fact the war is dragging on is down to Ukraine’s courageous and inspiring refusal to bow to a ruthless dictator and his invading hordes, and the only reason they’ve been able to hold out for so long is the military support the West has given them. Britain’s led the way in Europe, and as President Zelensky told Parliament, both Boris Johnson and now Rishi Sunak deserve great credit for their unwavering commitment and support when it’s really mattered. But now is the critical time. Intelligence reports suggest Russia is preparing for a fresh, massive onslaught in the coming weeks to try to force victory, deploying not just conventional weaponry but rape, torture, and murder to crush the will of these remarkably resilient Ukrainians. Despicable Putin’s even released scores of dangerous violent prison inmates to do this dirty depraved work for him with the promise of freedom if they come back alive. As Zelensky said, this is not just a local fight between neighbours squabbling over territorial rights, this is a fight for democracy against totalitarianism. ‘Freedom will win, we know Russia will lose,’ he told Britain’s MPs - to huge cheers. However, these things will only now happen if we give Zelensky what he is demanding. In the end, when it comes to winning a war, positive words are meaningless compared to action. Winston Churchill put it best: ‘It’s no use saying, “we are doing our best”, you have got to succeed in doing what is necessary.’ The West cannot afford to let Putin win this war. If we do, he will inevitably invade other countries to continue his plan to restore the former Soviet Union he believes should never have been broken up. To borrow Churchill’s words, for Ukraine to succeed, we must do what is necessary. Right now, that means giving them fighter jets, and lots of them. Zelensky presented the Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, with a hero Ukrainian pilot’s helmet inscribed with the words: ‘‘We have freedom, give us wings to protect it.’ It was a powerfully evocative conclusion to a stunningly effective speech. And to the ditherers and waverers in Germany and America, I would remind them of what Margaret Thatcher said to President George H.W. Bush when he hesitated over what action to take against Saddam Hussein after the Iraqi tyrant invaded Kuwait in 1990. The Iron Lady took him aside and said: ‘Remember George, this is no time to go wobbly.’ ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21327571/ukraine-zelensky-evil-putin-invasion-speech/
Nicola Bulley cops told to search specific part of river close to where teen vanished 45 years ago,"COPS searching for Nicola Bulley have been told to scour a specific part of the river - close to where a teen vanished 45 years ago.  A local river expert says there are inlets and gullies connected to the River Wyre that are not accessible by boat - and would have to be searched on foot.  The man, who The Sun Online has agreed not to name, said the areas were close to where missing 16-year-old Roger Jones' body was found - two months after he disappeared.  The St Michaels on Wyre resident, who says he knows the icy Lancashire waterway ""inside out"", claims he's told cops to search those spots.   He said if Nicola had fallen into the river her body could have ended up where Roger's did.  The teen ended up in the River Wyre after he was thrown into the water during a motorbike smash on January 27, 1978 - exactly 45 years before Nicola disappeared. His body was found two months later, washed up on a sandbank at low tide seven miles away.  The river expert told The Sun Online: ""There are a few places where you'd most likely get lodged for a night or two where there are inlets and gullies, some of which are quite long. ""You can't take a boat down them. ""I just don't understand why we're not searching this area. ""History says that by now she would be much further down the river.""  He added: ""I've seen sheep wash up, logs wash up, half of trees wash up, and over a period of time you know how slowly things move around and where they move to.""  The man, who says he's been riding his jetski on the waterway for more than a decade, said he believed the 45-year-old was in the water - which is the police's main ""hypothesis"".  He said: ""It's a very slippery embankment, there are a lot of rocks where you would fall and you could easily crack your head or you might just fall into the middle. ""So potentially she did fall into the river. You could easily fall in."" The man claimed he asked police divers when they'd searched the areas, and they ""said about day two"".  He continued: ""She wouldn't have been there on day two.  ""I can't help but think they should be doing a land search in these areas.""  History says that by now she would be much further down the river.  The expert said he couldn't help but compare Nicola's disappearance to Roger's.  He said: ""He fell in around the same point, albeit in the faster moving bit, but it's only 100 metres away and he ended up exactly where I've been saying we should be searching for days. ""It would take an hour a day to check that area. ""  The man continued: ""My concern is the tides get bigger. They are so focused on the same stretch of river. ""It just annoys me. Why not stay another day or two and search the area the body is most likely to be?""  It comes as police were today seen scouring the sea and coastline - 20 miles away from where the mum vanished.

Ukraine-backing Brit who supplied 100 military vehicles to war-torn country faces ruin after Barclays axes his accounts,"A BRITISH businessman who has sold 100 military vehicles to war-torn Ukraine is being driven to the wall after Barclays Bank pulled the plug on his finances. Nick Mead, 61, runs driving experience days for enthusiasts on his farm and collects and restores tanks and armoured cars. But he began focusing on ferrying hardware to Ukraine to help defenders hold back Vladimir Putin's hordes when war broke out a year ago. His company - called Tanks A Lot - went on to legally supply scores of vehicles to the front line in deals cleared by the Department of Trade and Industry. Villagers caught in the middle of the mayhem have even clubbed together to buy his bullet and bomb-proof vehicles to ferry fighters into battle - and wounded civilians away from danger. But Barclays bosses have now deemed Mr Mead's business ""high risk"" and shut down his business, savings and online accounts after 40 years. A stern letter sent by bank bosses refuses to explain why the accounts are being axed, despite turnover rocketing a staggering 40-fold to £8 million in 12 months thanks to the Ukraine trade. And his flourishing firm's supply of military hardware has now stalled as he faces ruin - because no other British bank will now take his account. Mr Mead told The Sun: ""It made me laugh to see all those politicians applauding Volodymyr Zelensky in parliament after they agreed to send 14 Challenger tanks. ""I've sent 100 vehicles to Ukraine over the past year, including tanks with guns, but I'm being driven out of business by a bank. “I’ve been banking with Barclays for 40 years and have never bounced a cheque but they haven’t even got the decency to explain their decision. ""I'm told I'm on a Russian hit list for the work I'm doing and I'm prepared to accept the risk to help Ukraine defend itself. “But banks worry more about the risk to their balance sheets. ""All I want to do is get help to where it's needed and give our Ukrainian friends what they're crying out for - but my hands are being tied."" Mr Mead has so far supplied a war fleet including 35 Spartan armoured personnel carriers which Ukrainians have used to ferry anti-tank crews into battle and evacuate civilians. He has also sent around 25 armoured ""snatch"" Land Rovers and Pinzgauer Vector six-wheeled utility vehicles. The wheeler-dealer, who employs nine staff on his sprawling site at Helmdon, Northants, buys used British Army vehicles at auctions and refurbishes them before sale. Another batch of 15 Spartans, seven armoured personnel carriers and two tank recovery vehicles are due to be dispatched to the front line within days. But he will be unable to move more tanks and trucks from his stock of 300 vehicles without a business account in place. And he may even be forced to fly to Singapore to open an account to keep his business afloat. Demand for fighting vehicles has rocketed across Europe and prices for vehicles like the popular Spartan have rocketed from £30,000 to £85,000 in recent months. But Mr Mead stressed he was not profiteering from the conflict. He said: “I could make a fortune if I sat tight and waited for the value of my vehicle stock to go up further and sold it in six months or a year’s time. “But all I want to do is help Ukraine now - and the bank is stopping me while our government drags its feet.” Father-of-three Mr Mead was sent a letter by Barclays Leicester Branch notifying him his cheque book and overdraft had been axed and that his account would close on February 20. British peer Lord Atlee on Thursday took up the case and blasted Barclays in the House of Lords. He said: “Since there are so few in the UK with the capability to supply these armoured vehicles to Ukraine, Barclays action will result in fewer Ukrainian soldiers benefitting from the protection. “It is quite likely that some Ukrainian soldiers will die as a result. “At the strategic level, Barclays actions must surely be entirely counter to the intent of HM government, which is to do whatever we can do to prevent Ukraine from being defeated. “It is not acceptable for a bank to withdraw banking services from a business which is helping the UK and Ukrainian Governments achieve their strategic objectives withoutgiving any reason.” A Barclays spokeswoman said: “Decisions to close customer accounts are only made after very careful consideration and based on all the facts available to us at the time.   ""We apply higher levels of due diligence in order to manage and mitigate risk, especially where third parties are involved.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21336277/ukraine-brit-vehicles-barclays-axes-accounts/

At least three of the group have been found dead as the disaster's death toll hit the grim milestone of 20,000 on Thursday. Despair has gripped Turkey and Syria since horrifying earthquakes struck on Monday - with thousands still missing. A girls' and boys' volleyball team had travelled to the Turkish city of Adiyaman from Famagusta Turkish Maarif College in Northern Cyprus with teachers and parents for a tournament. They were staying at the Isias Hotel when the multi-storey building suddenly crumbled. Four of the group of 39 miraculously survived the collapse and scrambled out of the wreckage. But two teachers were found dead on Wednesday, and the body of one of the students on Thursday, according to local media reports. Panicked parents of the youngsters have travelled to the area as they await news of their children. Much of the city was razed to the ground when two horror earthquakes struck within hours on Monday. One mother who flew into the area told Cyprus Mail: ""There are no news of our children, whoever we asked told us that no children came out of there.  ""The eight-storey hotel has completely collapsed."" It comes as hopes of finding survivors buried under rubble dwindle. Experts have warned the survival window for those still trapped under wrecked buildings is diminishing as the days go by. David Alexander, professor of emergency planning and management at University College London said: ""Statistically, today is the day when we're going to stop finding people. ""That doesn't mean we should stop searching."" Turkish officials said almost 3,000 buildings had collapsed in seven different provinces, including public hospitals. Heartbreaking photos and videos show bodies being pulled from the toppled buildings in cities reduced to ruins following one of the deadliest earthquakes worldwide in more than a decade.  Emergency crews used pick axes, shovels and jackhammers to dig through twisted metal and concrete and occasionally still pulled out survivors.  But in some places, their focus shifted to demolishing unsteady buildings. Heartbreaking footage showed the moment a little girl protected her brother while trapped under rubble. The youngsters were rescued after being stuck for 36 hours. Miriam, seven, desperately clung to her younger brother as she begged the rescue worker to ""get us out of here"". The massive 7.8 magnitude quake stuck early on Monday with such force that it moved the country 10ft. Two further earthquakes struck in the 24 hours after the initial tremor, leaving a trail of destruction stretching for hundreds of miles along Turkey’s border with Syria. The death toll on Thursday tragically surpassed 20,000. Turkish authorities confirmed 17,134 people have died, while at least 3,317 have been found dead in Syria - bringing the total to 20,451. Sun readers have helped send more than £500,000 to those affected by the disaster through our Earthquake Appeal after just two days of fundraising. All money from The Sun’s aid plea is being donated to the British Red Cross, providing on-the-ground relief in the wake of the disaster in Turkey and Syria.

Nadine Dorries holds back tears as she makes major career announcement after period of ‘soul searching’,"NADINE Dorries held back tears as she made a major career announcement after a period of ""soul searching"". Dorries announced she will stand down as an MP after saying that the Tories' election hopes are ""terminal"".  The tearful former Cabinet Minister said that after ""much soul-searching"" has decided to quit at the next poll. In a parting shot she blamed colleagues who ousted Boris Johnson for putting the party on course for defeat. She said on her TalkTV show airing tomorrow night: ""There is no way on God’s earth that those who plotted to depose Boris Johnson expected to be in the position we’re in today. ""The Conservatives are polling worse now than in 1997 when they were thrashed by Labour."" Ms Dorries warned: ""Today it’s 24 points behind. And that, my friends, could be described as terminal. ""It leaves the party boxed into a corner with no exit route.""And she let rip at the ""elite, the faux political intellectuals"" who supported Rishi Sunak and those who ""drank the Kool-Aid"" to move against Boris.  She will step down as MP for Mid Bedfordshire which she has represented since 2005. Fighting back tears she said: ""Despite it being a job that I’ve loved for every year I’ve done it, I'm now off."" In the clip released ahead of tomorrow night's TalkTV show, she spoke about the emotional news as well as other bombshells. It comes as Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promoted trusted MP Greg Hands to be Tory Chairman in a Cabinet reshuffle recently. The PM also carved up the business brief into three parts, creating a Net Zero department. Ex-Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Secretary Grant Shapps takes on the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero role. Yesterday, Ukraine's President Zelensky called on Britain to send fighter jets to aid his country in fighting against Russia's brutal invasion. In response to this call for British aid, Rishi Sunak said ""nothing is off the table"" but refused to commit to plans to send the aircraft to Europe.
