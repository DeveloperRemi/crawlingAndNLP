"Bus services could be slashed within days without new cash pledge, warns Labour","Labour called on the Government to offer new guarantees under the Bus Recovery Grant as a crunch deadline looms for transport operators and passengersBus companies will start slashing hundreds of services in 10 days unless ministers provide funding guarantees, Labour warned today. The Government’s Bus Recovery Grant is set to expire at the end of March - and operators must give six weeks’ notice of plans to cancel or change routes. Labour’s analysis, based on figures by the Confederation of Passenger Transport released today, reveals more than 1,600 routes could be cut this spring - leaving England with fewer than 10,000 routes for the first time since records began. Over 1,100 routes have been axed in the last year alone. Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh said: “The Conservatives are asleep at the wheel, risking the future of services millions of passengers depend on.” “They have 10 days to act, or services could plunge to a record low.” Read More
  Operators must give 42 days’ notice to the Traffic Commissioner to register changes to or withdrawals of routes. With current funding set to expire from the end of March, the last date for companies to announce cancellations will be February 17 - unless they get certainty from the Government. Buses are the most used mode of public transport in England – with 2.8 billion passenger journeys in 2021/22. But the CPT has warned that up to 15% of bus services in England are at risk unless the Bus Recovery Grant is renewed. Labour said a15% cut would see services fall from 10,941 to 9,300 – a fall of 1,641. It would be the first time they fell below 10,000 since the Traffic Commissioner watchdog began reporting figures. Last April, ministers announced that 31 areas in England, including Liverpool, Norfolk and Cornwall, had been chosen to receive funding from a £1.08bn pot of cash to boost bus services. In March 2021, the Government unveiled its £3bn bus “revolution”, promising “more frequent, reliable, easier to use and cheaper bus services”. The-then Prime Minister Boris Johnson trumpeted the “Bus Back Better” plan, saying: “Buses are lifelines and liberators, connecting people to jobs they couldn’t otherwise take, driving pensioners and young people to see their friends, sustaining town centres and protecting the environment. “As we build back from the pandemic, better buses will be one of our first acts of levelling-up.”  Labour today called on the Government to “give bus operators, communities and local leaders the certainty they need on the future of the Bus Recovery Grant”. The party also urged ministers to “come clean on wider long-term funding for the Bus Back Better strategy”. It said: “Over half of communities are seeing no funding whatsoever from the strategy, leaving the Government’s pledge to transform bus services in tatters.” Ms Haigh added: “After 13 years of the Conservatives, the bus services communities depend on are stumbling from one crisis to the next.” “Labour will reform the broken bus system, giving communities control of their own bus routes and fares, delivering the better bus services that passengers need.” The Department for Transport was contacted for comment. * Follow Mirror Politics on Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter and Facebook ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/bus-services-could-slashed-within-29147556,
Warning hundreds of England bus services face cuts,"Hundreds of bus services across England could be cut if government funding is not extended, the industry has warned. Up to 15% of services could be scrapped, according to the Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents bus and coach firms. With government funding and the temporary £2 fare cap set to expire at the end of March, the industry is calling for a long term support plan. The Department for Transport has refused to comment on the issue. Buses are the most popular form of public transport in England. The government has provided £2bn to support bus firms during the pandemic when passenger numbers fell, but this help runs out at the end of next month. Passenger numbers have not returned to those seen before the pandemic. That, alongside rising fuel prices and driver shortages, are putting an increasing strain on commercial bus services. Even with the additional support over a thousand routes across England were lost last year. ""Sustained investment in maintaining bus services will unlock huge economic, health and environmental returns for the taxpayer and leverage further private sector investment in new technologies such as zero emission vehicles."" said Graham Vidler, chief executive of the Confederation of Passenger Transport (CPT). Labour has warned the government has ""ten days to act"" as operators need to give six weeks notice to register any changes or cuts to bus routes. Its analysis of the CPT's figures shows that if not, England could be left with fewer than 10,000 routes for the first time since records began.  The Shadow Transport Secretary Louse Haigh MP said ""the future of services millions of passengers depend on"" was at risk. A Conservative Party spokeswoman said its funding had already helped to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and maintain services. The Urban Transport group, a network of city transport authorities, says no long term funding plan makes ""a mockery"" of the £2 fare cap scheme ""if the very services the scheme was designed to promote were then scrapped"".

Almost one in 10 local bus services axed over last year in Great Britain,"Exclusive: Cuts come despite government’s levelling up promise to improve transport connectivity. Almost one in 10 local bus services were axed in Great Britain in the last year despite government promises to improve local transport connectivity being a key pillar of its levelling up agenda. -----------------------------1The reductions – equivalent to more than 1,000 registered routes – follow the publication of a national bus strategy for England in 2021, aimed at improving routes and service frequencies. The figures suggest the “bus back better” strategy, conceived under the then prime minister Boris Johnson, has failed to halt the decline in local bus services. -----------------------------2A Guardian analysis of data from the Traffic Commissioners – the body responsible for registration of local bus services – found the number of live registered services fell 9.5% between January 2022 and 2023. -----------------------------3People in communities such as Sheffield, Bath, Lincoln or Stoke-on-Trent, among many others, told the Guardian how axed, unreliable or infrequently serviced bus routes had forced them to abandon medical appointments, house purchases or going to work. -----------------------------4A local bus service used to regularly take Rosa Kell, a disabled pensioner, from Wells in Somerset – often described as England’s smallest city – to Weston-super-Mare, where she would go shopping, meet a friend or visit her dentist. -----------------------------5“On 8 October, the local bus company, First, axed the service, because it was not commercially viable,” she said. “Passengers got a partial route reinstated. The new temporary service is insufficient for workers as it finishes at 5.40pm. It has left many schoolchildren arriving late for school or having to use taxis.” -----------------------------6From April, even this service is predicted to stop, when the government’s bus recovery grant runs out – an England-wide subsidy aimed at helping local bus services recover from the pandemic. The Guardian understands the Department for Transport (DfT) is considering long-term support for the bus sector from April. -----------------------------7“Rural residents are being abandoned by the government,” Kell said. “We’ll have no access to jobs, colleges, larger shops, GPs, or a social life. There is much talk of ‘levelling up’, but where is the level when we have nothing?” -----------------------------8Kell is one of hundreds of people who responded to a Guardian Community callout about public transport options. -----------------------------9Scores of people, many of them elderly, from cities and rural areas such as Somerset, Devon, Worcestershire, Hertfordshire, Lancashire and Cambridgeshire said they were practically stuck at home, cannot access healthcare, shops or education and have given up socialising. -----------------------------10Melissa, a mother and secondary school teacher from Hampshire, said her 12-year-old daughter developed chilblains, an inflammatory skin condition caused by overexposure to cold, after waiting for the bus for an hour at -5C on her way to school last December. -----------------------------11Since a local bus company went out of business last year, she said, pupils had been frequently late for school or left standing by the roadside because buses are too full to pick them up. -----------------------------12John, 53, an NHS call handler at a large Birmingham hospital, said delays of up to an hour on bus routes in the area caused hospital staff to arrive late for work, leaving emergency call handling “severely affected”. His partner, who also works for the hospital, has retired early as a result. “Her department is cut to the bone, but she’s had enough. I may follow suit soon, since I have to leave the house two hours before my shift starts to be on time now.” -----------------------------13Ellen Nierop, a healthcare assistant from Norwich, was one of several who told the Guardian that First Bus representatives were responding to complaints saying: “We are not a public service, we are here to make a profit.” -----------------------------14A First Bus spokesperson did not deny this message was given out to customers, but said the company was “doing everything we can to maintain reliable services” amid “challenging” driver shortages in some areas and “changing customer travel habits post Covid”. -----------------------------15Falling local bus registrations is a trend that has continued for over a decade, matched by a consistent decline in vehicle miles, passenger journeys, and local government funding. DfT figures show the number of miles driven by local buses in England fell 27% in the 10 years ending 2021-22. The pandemic has also had an impact, with a 16% reduction in miles driven between 2020-21 and 2021-22. Passenger journeys have continued to fall, especially on services outside London. -----------------------------16One of the government’s core 12 levelling up missions is to improve local transport connectivity across the UK to the standards of London by 2030. Last year, research by the Campaign for Better Transport found just 40% of transport authorities applying for funding under the bus back better strategy were allocated money, and those that were successful were only allocated 24% of what they had asked for. -----------------------------17Peter Travis, a co-chair of Somerset Bus Partnership, which was set up when bus back better was launched in March 2021, said drastic further cuts of bus routes were inevitable unless the bus recovery grant was extended beyond April. -----------------------------18“The high hopes for bus back better have been dashed as the government cannibalised that funding, designed to improve buses, and used it to keep buses running during Covid,” he said. -----------------------------19“It was going to offer an extraordinary transformation across England. Somerset asked for £165m and got £12m in April last year. We were grateful for the £12m, but we needed £165m to transform our transport here.” -----------------------------20The registration figures do not capture services that have not been de-registered but have instead had their timetables or routes reduced. Not all de-registrations will have meant a reduction in coverage: some operators have also been tidying up their registrations in recent years, and some de-registrations may reflect the removal of competing routes and services from multiple bus companies. -----------------------------21A DfT spokesperson said it was committed to the national bus strategy. They said: “We have invested £2bn to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and help maintain existing bus routes and over £1bn through bus service improvement plans, while still maintaining the annual £250m bus service operator grant to support services. -----------------------------22“We’ve also invested £60m to cap single bus tickets at £2 across England from 1 January to 31 March to tackle congestion and deliver real savings for passengers.” -----------------------------23Gill Page, a self-employed musician and festival director, lives in a village in the prime minister Rishi Sunak’s constituency of Richmond in North Yorkshire. -----------------------------24“Accessing health and other services is almost impossible without private transport in rural North Yorkshire. -----------------------------25“If you catch the local bus that runs once a day at 9.15 and returns at 12.15, it’s £8 for a return journey. Rishi Sunak is usually a good constituency MP, but these kinds of things just really don’t occur to him. There’s no practical need for these issues to occur to him.” -----------------------------26",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/24/almost-one-10-local-bus-services-axed-last-year-great-britain,

UK economy to go BACKWARDS in 2023 with worst performance of all major nations,"The UK is set to see its economy contract 0.6% this year according to the International Monetary Fund which will be the worst performance of all the advanced nations Brits are set for more misery this year as the economy will slam into reverse and it will see the worst performance of all the advanced nations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned. In its latest World Economic Outlook update, the IMF downgraded its UK gross domestic product (GDP) forecast once again, predicting a contraction of 0.6% against the 0.3% growth pencilled in last October as Britain looks set to suffer more than most from soaring inflation and higher interest rates. But it nudged up its outlook for UK growth in 2024 to 0.9%, up from the 0.6% expansion previously forecast. The grim outlook for the year ahead puts the UK far behind its counterparts in the G7 group of advanced nations and the only country - across advanced and emerging economies - expected by the IMF to suffer a year of declining GDP. Among the other G7 nations, the IMF's 2023 GDP predictions show growth of 1.4% in the United States, 0.1% in Germany, 0.7% in France, 0.6% in Italy, 1.8% in Japan and 1.5% in Canada.   It comes against a backdrop of public sector strikes over pay and predictions that the UK is heading for a recession, with inflation still standing at more than 10%. The IMF said Britain's predicted GDP fall reflects ""tighter fiscal and monetary policies and financial conditions and still-high energy retail prices weighing on household budgets"". It follows efforts by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt last week to talk up the UK economy and its growth prospects in his first major speech in the post, declaring that ""declinism about Britain was wrong in the past and it is wrong today"". The IMF offered a chink of light in the otherwise gloomy economic update, predicting that the global slowdown will be shallower than first feared. It upgraded its global growth forecast, to 2.9% in 2023 from the 2.7% predicted in October as it said the reopening of China after strict Covid restrictions has ""paved the way for a faster-than-expected recovery"".   The IMF also said it believes global inflation has passed its peak and will fall from 8.8% last year to 6.6% in 2023 and 4.3% in 2024 as interest rate hikes by central banks begin to cool demand and slow price rises. But it warned that, in the UK and Europe, surging prices and the impact of action taken to rein in inflation, will continue to weigh on the economy. It said: ""Consumer confidence and business sentiment have worsened. ""With inflation at about 10% or above in several euro area countries and the United Kingdom, household budgets remain stretched. ""The accelerated pace of rate increases by the Bank of England and the European Central Bank is tightening financial conditions and cooling demand in the housing sector and beyond."" Mr Hunt said: ""The Governor of the Bank of England recently said that any UK recession this year is likely to be shallower than previously predicted, however these figures confirm we are not immune to the pressures hitting nearly all advanced economies. ""Short-term challenges should not obscure our long-term prospects - the UK outperformed many forecasts last year, and if we stick to our plan to halve inflation, the UK is still predicted to grow faster than Germany and Japan over the coming years.""

UK economy likely to avoid recession - think tank,"The UK is likely to avoid a recession this year, an economic think tank has predicted. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said the economy will grow marginally despite high prices hitting household budgets. But it warned while the UK may not fall into recession, it will feel like one for at least seven million households. The forecast comes ahead of figures showing how well the UK economy is doing, which are due on Friday. An economic recession is defined as when the economy shrinks for two consecutive three-month periods. If a country's economy shrinks, it means it's performing badly and typically, companies make less money and cut jobs leaving the government with less tax revenue to spend on public services. NIESR has predicted the economy will grow by 0.2% this year, with growth rising to 1% in 2024. The forecast paints a more optimistic picture than others, such as the Bank of England's. However NIESR's still warned the rising cost of living would mean for millions, particular in the North East of England and in parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, it would feel like a recession.  Inflation, which is the rate prices rise at, has been hitting the budgets of UK households, with energy and food costs high. NIESR said one in four UK households - some seven million families - would be unable to meet in full their planned energy and food bills from their post-tax income in the 2023-24 financial year, up from around one in five in 2022-23. Middle-income households would face a hit to their disposable income ranging from 7% to 13%, reaching up to £4,000 in this financial year, its researchers added. It said as many people examine their finances, fewer will be able to retire early, meaning more workers between the ages of 50-64 will return to work.  The government has been considering plans to coax retired middle-aged workers back into jobs to boost the economy, with 300,000 fewer people in employment than before the pandemic.  A Treasury spokesperson, in response to the research by the NIESR, said the UK was not immune to global challenges of high inflation and slow growth.  The government reiterated it's a plan to halve inflation, which is at 10.5%, this year, but many economists expect this to happen anyway largely due to a slowdown in energy price rises and as post-pandemic supply problems ease. NIESR's forecast comes after several others, which have not gone as far as suggesting the UK economy will avoid recession. The Bank of England said last week the UK is set to enter recession this year but one which will be shorter and less severe than previously thought. The Bank has raised interest rates to 4% - their highest level in 14 years - in a bid to curb inflation. The Bank's governor Andrew Bailey explained that the slump it predicts is now expected to last just over a year rather than almost two, due to energy bills falling and price rises slowing down. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which works to stabilise economic growth, has predicted a more gloomy picture for the UK economy. It has forecast it to shrink and perform worse than other advanced economies, including Russia. Economic forecasters are not always right when it comes to predicting the future. For example, the IMF's forecasts have picked up fewer than 10% of recessions a year ahead of time, according to an analysis it conducted of recessions around the world between 1992 and 2014.

"We’ve avoided recession for now, but the outlook is one of perma-gloom","December’s GDP was boosted by us all cranking up the heating. Actual economic growth has not looked so weak in decades. A glance back at 2022 will show that the economy held up better than some forecasters expected. The Bank of England was among many to expect the second half of last year to see the start of a recession that would stretch into 2023. -----------------------------1As it is, it now expects that, when they are published on Friday, official figures for gross domestic product (GDP) in the last three months of 2022 will show this was narrowly avoided. -----------------------------2In a heavily revised outlook published to accompany its decision to raise interest rates by half a percentage point to 4%, the Bank said the recession would instead begin this year and continue until spring 2024, indicating a shorter and shallower downturn than it was predicting in November. -----------------------------3City analysts mostly agree that the UK avoided a recession – defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction – at the end of last year. Investec said last week that a very mild month-on-month fall in output from November to December would still leave GDP 0.1% higher in the fourth quarter compared with the third, when GDP fell 0.3%. -----------------------------4Forecasts of GDP proved tricky during the pandemic. The stop-start nature of economic activity triggered dramatic falls and rises in output. Once the pandemic was out of the way, the Queen’s jubilee in June and her funeral three months later created more unexpected peaks and troughs. -----------------------------5To illustrate, December’s GDP number is likely to be saved from a deep fall by everyone having turned on their boilers and heaters in the cold weather, not a turnaround in manufacturing or some other good news. -----------------------------6As Investec economist Philip Shaw said in a note: “While strikes intensified during the month, weighing on output, we judge that the main driver will be that a cold month resulted in a boost to utility output.” -----------------------------7A look at the past three years, even the past decade, shows the trend for growth is modest and pay growth roughly flat. This means that by 2026, GDP will have just about recovered to its 2019 peak. -----------------------------8It is a grim picture, and one the Bank of England believes will stretch over the rest of the 2020s. -----------------------------9The Resolution Foundation says that while the Bank of England may have upgraded its economic outlook, with a shorter and shallower recession than it forecast last November, it also showed that the UK was “in the midst of the weakest 20-year period of growth since 1938”. -----------------------------10Torsten Bell, the thinktank’s chief executive, says this puts Britain on a path to “perma-stagnation” and at risk of “a prolonged, and far deeper, living standards downturn” than previously believed. -----------------------------11Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey justified raising interest rates for a 10th time, to 4%, in part because he said this scenario was relatively benign. He said the risks of inflation rebounding, and interest rates staying elevated, was high, with the risk of a return to soaring inflation being the highest in the monetary policy committee’s 25-year history. -----------------------------12Listening to Bailey was like tuning into a treatise by New York University economics professor Nouriel Roubini, who earned the nickname Dr Doom when he made a fuss about the calamitous betting by financial institutions before the 2008 financial crash. -----------------------------13Roubini has predicted that inflation will stay higher than all central banks expect, largely because the Ukraine war is just the first in a long line of global disputes that will harm trade and supply chains, and push up prices. -----------------------------14The Bank of England considers a return of high gas and commodity prices a threat, but what it fears the most is a dearth of people willing and able to work. And if there are not enough workers, employers will continue to bid up wages, which will translate into higher prices next year and the year after. -----------------------------15Yet even if neither comes to pass, the UK is still left with low investment, low wages growth and flat GDP. It’s not an appetising prospect. -----------------------------16",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/05/weve-avoided-recession-for-now-but-the-outlook-is-one-of-perma-gloom,
"Britain to be worst-performing major economy this year, warns IMF; UK mortgage approvals tumble and company insolvencies surge – as it happened","Britain is the only G7 economy forecast to shrink in 2023, the IMF says, as higher energy prices, rising mortgage costs and increased taxes hit growth.. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets. -----------------------------1Growth, or the lack of it, is the main issue today after the International Monetary Fund released its latest economic forecasts overnight … and as we await eurozone GDP figures this morning. -----------------------------2The IMF’s message for Britain was grim – the UK is the only advanced economy expected to fall into recession this year. -----------------------------3UK GDP is forecast to shrink by 0.6% this year, the worst forecast for any G7 country this year, which is a 0.9 percentage point downward revision from October’s forecasts. -----------------------------4The IMF blamed the downgrade on tighter government spending policies and higher interest rates (which may be raised again on Thursday), and the burden from still-high energy retail prices on household budgets. -----------------------------5Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF’s economic counsellor, said 2023 would be “quite challenging” for the UK as it slipped from top to bottom of the G7 league table. -----------------------------6He added: -----------------------------7.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}“There is a sharp correction.” -----------------------------8The move piles more pressure on UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt, who’s facing calls from business groups for a more ambitious growth strategy, and demands from some Conservative MPs for tax cuts. -----------------------------9This contraction would follow 4.1% growth in 2022, the IMF says, one of the fastest growth rates among advanced economies last year. -----------------------------10The broader economic picture has brightened a little, though, the IMF says, citing “signs of resilience and China reopening”. -----------------------------11The IMF has lifted its forecast for the world economy this year: global growth will slow from 3.4% in 2022 to 2.9% in 2023 – an upgrade on its previous forecast of 2.7%. -----------------------------12The IMF’s Gourinchas says China’s sudden reopening paves the way for a rapid rebound in activity. -----------------------------13Gourinchas writes: -----------------------------14.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}The global economy is poised to slow this year, before rebounding next year. Growth will remain weak by historical standards, as the fight against inflation and Russia’s war in Ukraine weigh on activity. -----------------------------15Despite these headwinds, the outlook is less gloomy than in our October forecast, and could represent a turning point, with growth bottoming out and inflation declining. -----------------------------16Economic growth proved surprisingly resilient in the third quarter of last year, with strong labor markets, robust household consumption and business investment, and better-than-expected adaptation to the energy crisis in Europe. Inflation, too, showed improvement, with overall measures now decreasing in most countries – even if core inflation, which excludes more volatile energy and food prices, has yet to peak in many countries. -----------------------------17We find out today how the French, Portuguese, Italian and the wider eurozone economy fared in the final quarter of last year. -----------------------------18Yesterday we learned that Germany’s GDP shrank unexpectedly in Q4, by 0.2%, putting Europe’s largest economy at risk of a winter recession. -----------------------------196.30am GMT: French Q4 2022 GDP report -----------------------------208.55am GMT: German unemployment report for January -----------------------------219.30am GMT: Portugal’s Q4 2022 GDP report -----------------------------229.30am GMT: UK mortgage approvals and consumer credit data for December -----------------------------2310am GMT: Italy’s Q4 2022 GDP report -----------------------------2410am GMT: Eurozone Q4 2022 GDP report -----------------------------251.30pm GMT: Canadian December and Q4 2022 GDP report -----------------------------262pm GMT: US house price index -----------------------------27Time for a recap. -----------------------------28The clouds covering the UK economy have darkened today, after mortgage approvals tumbled last month, company insolvencies jumped, and the IMF predicted Britain would be the only major industrialised country to see its economy shrink this year. -----------------------------29The Bank of England reported that mortgage approvals decreased to around 35,600 in December from 46,200 in November. Housing experts said higher interest rates and the cost of living squeeze had hit the housing market. -----------------------------30The number of companies falling into insolvency in England and Wales last year surged to its highest since 2009, according to figures from the Insolvency Service. Total company insolvencies registered in 2022 leapt by 57% to 22,109 from the previous year. -----------------------------31Uk households were hit by soaring price in supermarkets this month, with grocery inflation jumping to 16.7%. -----------------------------322023 will be a rough year for the UK economy, according to the latest IMF forecasts which predict GDP will shrink by 0.6% this year, a downgrade of almost 1%. -----------------------------33The IMF revised up its forecast for global growth this year, though, to 2.9% from 2.7% before. -----------------------------34Labour shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has told parliament that Britain has huge potential, but 13 years of Tory failure has been a “drag anchor on prosperity”. -----------------------------35She told MPs: -----------------------------36.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}The UK is the only major economy forecast to shrink this year. -----------------------------37Weaker growth compared to our competitors for both of the next two years. -----------------------------38The World upgraded.

Lynch denies all charges against him. -----------------------------63The US hedge fund QCM has backed up its short position, publishing on Tuesday a 69-page document criticising the management and operations of Darktrace. -----------------------------64The firm alleges that questionable and aggressive marketing, sales and accounting practices were employed by Darktrace to drive up the value of the company before its multibillion-pound flotation in London almost two years ago. -----------------------------65Here’s the full story: -----------------------------66Twitter has made its first interest payment on the $12.5bn of debt that Elon Musk used to take the social media giant private last year, Bloomberg reported overnight. -----------------------------67The social media group paid a group of seven banks, led by Morgan Stanley, who are still holding the debt after not managing to sell it on to investors. -----------------------------68The first coupon was expected to cost Twitter roughly $300m, according to Bloomberg calculations and market participants not involved in the Twitter deal. -----------------------------69Appetite for this debt may have weakened after Musk fired half of Twitter’s staff, spooking advertisers and leading to a slump in revenue. -----------------------------70Musk has been busy pushing through changes at Twitter, including the Twitter Blue subscription service, which lets users pay for the “verified” badge. -----------------------------71Twitter co-founder Biz Stone told the Guardian earlier this month that Elon Musk “doesn’t seem like” the right person to own Twitter, and that positive changes at the company had been unwound. -----------------------------72The UK economy has been hit by a triple-whammy in recent days, Liberal Democrat Sarah Olney tells MPs. -----------------------------73She cites the IMF’s prediction that the UK economy will shrink this year, figures from the ONS showing the horrors of the winter of discontent (almost a quarter of adults can’t keep warm, and 15% fear running out of food) and this morning’s figures showing the surge in insolvencies last year to the highest level since 2009. -----------------------------74Q: When and where will the Brexit benefits begin? -----------------------------75Treasury minister James Cartlidge says UK unemployment is the lowest in almost 50 years, helped by measures such as the pandemic furlough scheme.

But, he points out, the average household will receive £1,300 of support this winter (from cost of living payments and the price cap on bills). -----------------------------85And on Hosie’s specific suggestion to change the windfall tax – Cartlidge say this would hurt the North Sea industry, and undermine energy security. -----------------------------86Q: Why the UK is still the only G7 economy that is smaller than before the pandemic, and the only G7 economy with its growth forecast downgraded this year, Rachel Reeves asks? -----------------------------87Treasury minister James Cartlidge says that since 2010, the UK has grown faster than France, Japan and Italy. He repeats that UK growth over the three years from 2022 to 2024 is expected to be higher than in Germany or Japan, and similar to the US. -----------------------------88And he cites the IMF’s overnight press conference, where IMF economic councellor Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said the good news was that the UK economy had done relatively well in the last year, with estimated growth of 4.1% in 2022 – one of the highest in Europe. -----------------------------89Cartlidge then points out that the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Ukraine war, have both hit the UK economy this year, and claims Labour would have kept the UK locked down for longer. -----------------------------90Labour shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has told parliament that Britain has huge potential, but 13 years of Tory failure has been a “drag anchor on prosperity”. -----------------------------91Responding to treasury minister James Cartlidge’s comments, Reeves says the IMF’s latest World Economic Outlook holds a mirror up to the UK’s wasted opportunities, adding “it is not a pretty sight”. -----------------------------92Reeves tells MPs: -----------------------------93.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}The UK is the only major economy forecast to shrink this year. -----------------------------94Weaker growth compared to our competitors for both of the next two years. -----------------------------95The World upgraded. The UK downgraded. -----------------------------96Growth even worse than sanctions-hit Russia. -----------------------------97Reeves points out that the IMF chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, singles out higher mortgage rates as a reason for Britain’s poor performance. -----------------------------98She says: -----------------------------99.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}The Tory mortgage penalty is devastating for family finances and is holding back our economy. -----------------------------100British business are paying the price for the “gaping holes in the Tories’ Brexit deal”, Reeves warns, adding: -----------------------------101.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}It will fall to Labour to clean up this mess. -----------------------------102And she criticises Jeremy Hunt for not answering today’s urgent question: -----------------------------103.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}If the Chancellor had ideas, answers or courage - he would be here today. But he is not. -----------------------------104The question people are now asking is this: -----------------------------105Are me and my family better off after 13 years of Tory government? -----------------------------106The answer is no. -----------------------------107And as the IMF show today – it doesn’t have to be this way. -----------------------------108Over in parliament, the Labour party have posed an urgent question on the IMF growth forecast for the UK, showing it is the only G7 economy forecast to shrink in 2023. -----------------------------109Junior Treasury minister James Cartlidge is responding, and defends the UK’s record. -----------------------------110He says the government has three economic priorities – to halve inflation this year, grow the economy and get debt falling. -----------------------------111Cartlidge points out that the IMF said today that it thinks the UK is on the right track, and that the UK had one of the best estimated growth rates for 2022 (revised up to 4.1%). -----------------------------112The UK’s cumulative growth over 2022-2024 is predicted to be higher than Germany and Japan, and similar to the US, Cartlidge adds. -----------------------------113Cartlidge insists that the government’s actions, “from unleashing innovation across AI, financial services and a host of other sectors to improving technical education and protecting infrastructure investment” will spur growth in coming years. -----------------------------114But, he adds, the IMF’s figures do confirm the UK is not immune to pressures hitting all advanced economies (a point chancellor Jeremy Hunt made earlier). -----------------------------115The best tax cut possible now is to lower inflation, the minister says. -----------------------------1162022 was a rough year for Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, which this morning reported a record loss of 1.64 trillion Norwegian kroner, or £132bn, for last year. -----------------------------117The so-called Government Pension Fund Global cited “very unusual” market conditions for its return of -14.1% last year. -----------------------------118Norges Bank Investment Management CEO Nicolai Tangen said in a statement. -----------------------------119.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}“The market was impacted by war in Europe, high inflation, and rising interest rates.

Germany on brink of recession as economy shrinks, central banks may raise interest rates to 15-year highs this week – as it happened,"German GDP shrank by 0.2% in Q4 2022, worse than expected, as investors anticipate borrowing costs to be hiked again this week. Time to wrap up… here are today’s main stories -----------------------------1Germany is facing a winter recession after its economy shrank in the last quarter.  -----------------------------2New official data showed German GDP fell by 0.2% in the October-December period, worse than expected, as the energy crisis and higher interest rates hit growth. -----------------------------3Analysts warned that Germany’s economic outlook is not too rosy, with ING’s Carsten Brzeski saying: -----------------------------4.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}Not falling off the cliff is one thing, staging a strong rebound, however, is a different matter. And there are very few signs pointing to a healthy recovery of the German economy any time soon. -----------------------------5First of all, we shouldn’t forget that fiscal stimulus over the last three years stabilised but did not really boost the economy. Industrial production is still some 5% below what it was before Covid, and GDP only returned to its pre-pandemic level in the third quarter of 2022. -----------------------------6Industrial orders have also weakened since the start of 2022, consumer confidence, despite some recent improvements, is still close to historic lows, and the loss of purchasing power will continue in 2023. -----------------------------7Sweden’s economy also contracted in Q4, by 0.6%, while Belgium managed modest growth of 0.1%. We find out tomorrow how France, Portugal, Italy and the wider eurozone fared….. -----------------------------8Investors are bracing for interest rates in major economies to hit their highest levels in around 15 years this week. -----------------------------9The Bank of England and the European Central Bank are both expected to raise their key interest rates by half-a-percent, while the US Federal Reserve may restrict itself to a quarter-point hike on Wednesday. -----------------------------10Here’s the rest of today’s main stories: -----------------------------11The European Union is to loosen state aid rules on tax credits for renewable energy projects, as it responds to America’s Inflation Reduction Act with its own subsidy support. -----------------------------12European policymakers have been under pressure to respond to the US president Joe Biden’s $369bn (£298bn) IRA, which aims to encourage renewables investment in everything from electric cars to wind turbines. -----------------------------13The European Commission plans to loosen state aid rules to enable investment into production facilities in green industries, according to draft plans. -----------------------------14EU member states are divided over whether to introduce the new rules and how long for, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the plans. -----------------------------15More here: -----------------------------16The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, told the World Economic Forum in Davos this month that new law targeting the region’s green industries were being drafted, in a bid to make Europe the home of clean tech and innovation. -----------------------------17Today’s worse-than-expected German growth figures come less than two weeks after chancellor Olaf Scholz said he was convinced Europe’s largest economy would not fall into a recession. -----------------------------18Scholz told Bloomberg TV: -----------------------------19.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}“I’m absolutely convinced that this will not happen that we are going into a recession. -----------------------------20“We showed that we are able to react to a very difficult situation.” -----------------------------21Growth in Texas factory activity slowed in January, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ Texas monthly manufacturing index. -----------------------------22Business executives reported that production slowed this month. This pulled down the Dallas Fed’s production index, a key measure of state manufacturing conditions, down from 9.1 to 0.2, a level suggesting output was flat. -----------------------------23Another mfg survey profile for January, another weak print, this time from the Dallas Fed: ""The production index, a key measure of state manufacturing conditions, fell from 9.1 to 0.2, with the near-zero reading suggestive of flat output."" https://t.co/envrgoZ9iW pic.twitter.com/Q7bpVCIeUR -----------------------------24The survey also found that perceptions of broader business conditions continued to worsen in January, while the new orders index was negative for an eighth month in a row, which suggests a continued decrease in demand. -----------------------------25But, factory bosses also reported stronger employment growth and longer workweeks. -----------------------------26And there were signs that inflation eased, with price pressures “generally steady” and wage growth easing slightly in January. -----------------------------27Timo Wollmershäuser of the Ifo Institute think-tank blames the cost of living crisis for pushing Germany into contraction. -----------------------------28Wollmershäuser says (via the FT): -----------------------------29.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}“High rates of inflation have driven the German economy into a winter recession.” -----------------------------30The EY Item Club, the forecasting group, predicts that the Bank of England will deliver better economic news on Thursday, as well as raising interest rates. -----------------------------31They say: -----------------------------32.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}A significant fall in gas prices, lower market interest rate expectations and an economy less weak than expected should cause the Bank of England to dial back on the downbeat economic outlook of its last forecast when it presents new projections on Thursday. -----------------------------33Stubborn core inflation and strong pay growth mean another 50 basis points rise in Bank Rate is likely. But the EY ITEM Club thinks this increase could prove the end of the current rate-rising cycle. -----------------------------34There are good reasons for the Bank of England’s concerns about persistent underlying inflation to ease, they suggest: -----------------------------35.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}Core inflation is probably being held up by the past effect of high energy prices on businesses’ costs. Now that energy prices are falling, underlying inflation should also fall. And the EY ITEM Club expects pay growth to soften as price inflation falls, a weak economy weighs on demand for workers and labour supply is boosted by a reduction in inactivity. -----------------------------36In the bond market, the Bank of England has sold £650m of long-dated UK government debt, or gilts, today. -----------------------------37This is the first auction of bonds with a maturity of more than 20 years from the Bank’s main stockpile built up through its quantitative easing stimulus programme, Reuters points out. -----------------------------38The sale was over-subscribed, with investors submitting bids worth £1.075bn – and the Bank choosing the best offers. -----------------------------39Germany’s slide into recession has begun, fears Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, who points to recent weak export data: -----------------------------40Germany's slide into recession has begun. The Q4 '22 GDP fall of -0.2% q/q is modest. It's the underlying picture that's worrying.

Central bank decisions in the United States, Eurozone, and United Kingdom, earnings updates from several Wall Street tech giants, and a heavy dose of economic data releases that include the US employment report all have the capacity to inject volatility into global markets. -----------------------------47All roads lead back to the Fed, which will announce its rate decision on Wednesday. Inflation finally seems to be cooling and leading indicators suggest economic growth is losing steam, but the US labor market remains historically tight and financial conditions have loosened, keeping the risk of a second inflation wave on the table and complicating matters for policymakers. -----------------------------48Markets have fully priced in a 25 basis point rate increase, so the dollar’s reaction will depend mostly on Powell’s commentary. One way to balance these risks would be to accompany the smaller rate hike with strict language, reminding investors that the tightening cycle is not done yet and pushing back against market pricing for rate cuts later this year.  -----------------------------49Adani Group, which is fighting claims from a US short-seller alleging the ‘biggest con in corporate history’ has received a boost today from Abu Dhabi-based conglomerate International Holding Company (IHC). -----------------------------50IHC has announced a $400m investment in Adani Enterprise’s fundraising through its subsidiary Green Transmission Investment Holding. -----------------------------51This is IHC’s first investment of 2023, and its second investment in Adani Group. Last year it invested $2bn in three of its green-focused companies. -----------------------------52Syed Basar Shueb, chief executive officer at IHC, says the group sees value in the Adani Enterprises Further Public Offering (FPO). -----------------------------53.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}“Our interest in Adani Group is driven by our confidence and belief in the fundamentals of Adani Enterprises Ltd; we see a strong potential for growth from a long-term perspective and added value to our shareholders.” -----------------------------54Adani Group published a 413-page rebuttal of fraud allegations by Hindenburg Research today, likening the US investment firm’s report last week to an attack on India amid mounting financial pressure on the coal conglomerate. -----------------------------55Ryanair is hiring significant numbers of Ukrainian pilots and cabin crew so that it will be ready to return to the country when the war with Russia ends. -----------------------------56Chief executive Michael O’Leary revealed the move today, after the airline reported a jump in profits for the last quarter of 2022 (see opening post for details). -----------------------------57“We are very committed to returning to Ukraine as soon as it is safe to do so,” said O’Leary (Reuters reports). -----------------------------58O’Leary told analysts: -----------------------------59.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}“We are hiring quite a number of Ukraine pilots and cabin crew specifically so that we can ... restore bases in Ukraine if and when it is safe to do so.” -----------------------------60While everyone is singing goldilocks in Europe GDP in Germany contracted -0.2 QoQ  and in Sweden -0.6%.In Belgium it was up by a whopping 0.1%. -----------------------------61The UK housing market could come under more pressure this week if, as expected, the Bank of England lifts UK base rate from 3.5% to 4% – the highest level since October 2008. -----------------------------62This would be the BoE’s 10th interest rate rise in a row, since it started tightening policy in December 2021, adding to the pressure on homeowners. -----------------------------63UK house prices have already fallen in recent months, according to Halifax and Nationwide. -----------------------------64Berenberg bank predicts UK house prices will fall by around 10% peak to trough, back to their levels in mid-2021. -----------------------------65Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg, points out that UK house price declines tend to have effects that extend beyond the housing sector, saying: -----------------------------66.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}During the previous two corrections – in the early 1990s and 2008/09 – falling house prices coincided with weakening consumer demand and disinflationary recessions. Will history repeat itself? We think the answer is yes. -----------------------------67Although we doubt the situation will be anything like 2008/09, the early 1990s may provide a useful benchmark. -----------------------------68The UK’s consumer-oriented economy is sensitive to large fluctuations in house prices. A fall in house prices lowers net worth, dampening confidence and the appetite to spend. -----------------------------69The housing correction will contribute towards the UK’s outsized – albeit still mild – recession relative to continental Europe, Pickering predicts: -----------------------------70.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}We expect real GDP growth for the Eurozone to slow from 3.4% in 2022 to 0.3% in 2023 before a gain of 1.5% in 2024. For the UK, however, we expect real GDP to contract by 0.8% in 2023 after a gain of 4.1% in 2022– before snapping back with growth of 1.6% in 2024. -----------------------------71More than 1.4 million UK households are due to renew their fixed-rate mortgages in 2023, the Office for National Statistics said earlier this month. -----------------------------72Andrew Wishart, senior property economist at Capital Economics, says the shift away from floating-rate to fixed-rate mortgages presents risks as well as benefits. -----------------------------73Wishart says: -----------------------------74.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}It will protect homeowners who are lucky enough to have a long time remaining on their fixed rate contract from higher mortgage payments. -----------------------------75But that reduces the potency of monetary policy, raising the risk that interest rates have to be raised further or kept high for longer to compensate. -----------------------------76Property website Zoopla reported this morning that house price growth was flat in the final quarter of last year. -----------------------------77House price growth ground to a standstill in Q4 2022, dragging the annual rate of house price inflation lower to +6.5%.

Global economic forecast for 2023? A stormy start followed by a ray of hope,"Wall Street predicts turbulent first six months but growing optimism at ebbing inflation, slowing pace of rate hikes and China’s reopening. Investors should brace for another turbulent year in the financial markets, economists have warned as central banks fight inflation, China reopens its economy after Covid-19 restrictions and the Ukraine war pushes the global economy towards recession. -----------------------------1The first half of the new year is likely to be choppy, according to Wall Street predictions, after global markets suffered their biggest fall since the 2008 financial crisis last year. -----------------------------2But the US S&P 500 is still expected to end 2023 a little higher than it began the year. The average target of 22 strategists polled by Bloomberg has the S&P 500 ending 2023 at 4,078 points – about 6% higher than it ended 2022. -----------------------------3Economists predict the US Federal Reserve will slow its interest rate hikes this year, as the outlook for America’s economy sours. US inflation has dropped back from its peak last summer, while the series of Fed rate hikes in 2022 has also cooled the housing market. -----------------------------4“We believe that a period of sub-trend growth is inevitable, and recession risks are high as the lagged effects of tighter monetary policy work their way through the economy,” said Brian Rose, senior US economist at UBS Global Wealth Management. -----------------------------5Michael Antonelli, managing director and market strategist at investment bank Baird, predicted the Fed would end its hiking cycle in February, and “hit the pause button” after one more rate rise. He also expects the US stock market to make gains during 2023, pointing out that two consecutive falls are “very rare”. -----------------------------6“The stock markets all about ‘Are things getting better or are things getting worse?’ I think they will get slightly better next year,” Antonelli told Yahoo Finance Live. -----------------------------7“I don’t think we’re getting any big gains, but I think next year will be somewhat positive,” Antonelli added. -----------------------------8Deutsche Bank predicts economic downturns this year, which will hit financial markets. -----------------------------9“We see major stock markets plunging 25% from levels somewhat above today’s when the US recession hits, but then recovering fully by year-end 2023, assuming the recession lasts only several quarters,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in their 2023 World Outlook late last year. -----------------------------10Strategists at Russell Investments believe a recession seems likely in 2023 and equity markets may struggle but remain hopeful a global economic recovery should be on the horizon by year-end. -----------------------------11The head of the International Monetary Fund has warned that this year is going to be “tougher than the year we leave behind”, with a third of the world’s economy in recession. Kristalina Georgieva said it would be “because the three big economies – the US, EU and China – are all slowing down simultaneously”. -----------------------------12A global downturn could prompt central banks to reverse some of the hefty interest rate rises implemented in the last year. Nikolaj Schmidt, chief international economist at investment management firm T. Rowe Price, predicts that central banks will ease monetary policy early in the second half of 2023. -----------------------------13“We see the world plunging into a global recession in 2023. The recession is going to be the result of the immense monetary tightening the central banks have administered over the past 12 months. As a silver lining, it will sow the seeds for a substantial retracement of inflation,” Schmidt said. -----------------------------14Analysts at investment bank Jefferies predict a global recession this year, but expect Asia could avoid an outright downturn.

What experts think of the RBA’s interest rate rises - and what they say is coming next,"Five leading economists give their views on what’s on the horizon for Australia’s economic future. The Reserve Bank surprised many on Tuesday by stating its expectation that “further increases in interest rates will be needed over the months ahead”, after another 25 basis point rise. Unlike previous years, the RBA governor, Philip Lowe, did not back up the RBA’s first rates meeting of 2023 with a speech to explain his thinking – his first outing is not until 17 February, when he is scheduled to front a House of Representatives committee. So we asked five economists what stood out from Tuesday’s verdict and where they think the Australian economy is heading. The ditching of the RBA’s previous stance of “not being on a pre-set path” was the standout change in Tuesday’s RBA commentary, according to Aird. Given the paucity of other economic figures of late, it suggests the bank assigned great weight to the December quarter inflation results. Headline consumer price inflation of 7.8% was less than the 8% peak the RBA had previously forecast for the end of 2022. However, the 6.9% pace of underlying inflation – the highest in two decades of data – appears to be the source of Lowe’s angst. The implication is “you have made up your mind about what you’re doing”, come what may, so a 10th consecutive rate rise on 7 March is all but decided. “If they don’t raise the cash rate in March, it will leave everyone confused,” Aird said. The RBA’s forecast for inflation to be at 4.75% at the end of 2023 compares with CBA’s prediction of 3.5% and for it to be back within the 2%-3% target range by early 2024. The central bank is only expecting a quarter point rise in the jobless rate over 2023 to 3.75%, while CBA is gloomier at 4.25%. St George retains its “core view” that the RBA’s cash rate, now at 3.35% as of Tuesday, will peak at 3.85%. Previously that peak was expected by May but Deda said 25bp hikes may now come in March and April. “I think they just want convincing signs that inflation is going to come down,” Deda said. December-quarter wage price index figures will provide some evidence on 22 February whether the half-century low jobless rate is stoking an acceleration in salary growth, but the ABS won’t release March-quarter inflation data until 26 April. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “It is our view that inflation peaked in Q4 [of 2022],” she said. “There’s always the danger that inflation expectations can become unmoored [and] that just makes it trickier for them to bring down inflation.” Easing supply chain shortages should begin to lower price pressures for goods, but an acceleration to 5.5% inflation for services in the December quarter showed those pressures are broadening. The path of similar economies to Australia – particularly New Zealand, Canada and the US – suggests the RBA’s cash rate will probably need to rise to 4%-4.5%, according to Hogan. “I just think that a lot of economists are losing sight of fundamental models,” Hogan says. The RBA “should get on with it – don’t grind this out”. The cost of living squeeze is already “all too real”, with thousands of children starting school this month “in the same clothes and shoes as last year”, and living standards sent “backwards by 10 years”. after newsletter promotion Still, the “critical risk factor” is if any central bank gets behind the game. “We know where it all ends, and that’s much higher interest rates and a guaranteed deep, damaging recession,” Hogan said. One factor being overlooked is big spending by state governments, particularly in Victoria and New South Wales, which is adding to demand at a time when fiscal restraint is needed. “It’s the state governments that are irresponsible,” he said. “They have no political cost to pay for this economic situation”, including pushing up wages and costs. The economy entered 2023 after a “really strong” December quarter in terms of household spending, with a pickup in wages in the second half of 2022, Rynne said. “Basically, [there are] more Australians employed than ever”, with the jobless rate hovering at 3.5% – close to the lowest in half a century. Markets, such as interest-rate curves, suggest the US will go into recession, and the global economy is “going to be very soft”. Since the first two quarters of last year, “you’ve now had monetary policy tightening pretty much everywhere”, Rynne said. “We all know that there’s a lag associated with their effect. It will start to have a bite globally.” “I actually do think prices are going to come off faster” than many expect, he said. Still, Australia is “operating beyond full employment” and that means wages will remain “an area of heightened concern” for the RBA. Also worth watching is how holders of a quarter of the $2tn mortgage market respond when they come off fixed-interest rates in the next year or so, and hit a “cliff” of sharply higher variable rates. Those with a typical $600,000 mortgage will start repaying about $13,500 more each year, rather than spending it elsewhere. Friday’s release of the RBA’s quarterly statement of policy will reveal more of the board’s thinking – in particular its forecast for underlying inflation. Recent signs also suggest global economic headwinds might not be as fierce as feared, according to Hawkins. The IMF, for instance, has trimmed its prediction of how much the global economy will slow compared with a few months ago. That may make the RBA “think they need to do a bit more” to curb inflation, Hawkins said. How much will China's reopening boost Australia's economy? @ANZ_Research estimates services alone will nudge up GDP by 0.4 percentage points over the coming two years.

Australia’s trade surplus fattened by about a third in the final three months of 2022 to $38.3bn. That improvement will add about a full percentage point to GDP growth alone, Belinda Allen, a senior CBA economist, said.

Ukraine war: Zelensky takes fighter jet bid to EU leaders,"Ukraine's leader has called on EU leaders to provide fighter jets and arms for the war against Russia, on his second trip abroad since the war began. ""We have to enhance the dynamics of our co-operation, we have to do it faster than the aggressor,"" said Volodymyr Zelensky. He was earlier given a standing ovation at the European Parliament in Brussels. Several EU leaders have already stressed that a decision on warplanes would be a collective move. Some are keen to avoid having the debate being played out in public, while there is also concern about escalation and playing into Russian narratives. The Kremlin warned on Thursday that the line between direct and indirect Western involvement in the conflict was disappearing. The chief of Mr Zelensky's presidential staff, Andriy Yermak, said cryptically that the question of long-range weaponry and fighter jets had been resolved. Mr Zelensky said only that certain agreements had been made that were positive but not yet public. The UK said no decision on providing jets in the long term had yet been made but it would provide training for Ukrainian pilots on the aircraft it already had.  Poland's prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said his country could only act ""within the entire formation of Nato"", while Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the issue had to be discussed behind closed doors. European Parliament President Roberta Metsola called on EU states to consider Kyiv's request for jets quickly. In his speech to the Parliament in Brussels, Mr Zelensky repeatedly linked Ukraine to a European way of life. Ukraine has applied to join the EU and is urging the bloc's leaders to throw its weight behind a swift course to accession, which usually takes many years. ""Ukraine is going to be a member of the European Union,"" he told MEPs. Together with Europe, he said Ukrainians were defending themselves against the ""biggest anti-European force of the modern world"". That theme was repeated at the later summit with EU leaders, where he stressed that Europe could not be free without a free Ukraine. The Ukrainian leader had earlier travelled from Paris with France's Emmanuel Macron, where he had also held talks with Germany's Olaf Scholz. Before visiting Paris, he had been assured by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak that nothing was off the table. Mr Zelensky said Germany and France had the potential to be ""game-changers"" in the war. The sooner Ukraine received heavy, long-range weapons and modern planes, ""the quicker this Russian aggression will end"", he explained. Although President Macron has previously signalled some openness to providing fighter jets, Mr Scholz has not. The French leader vowed Ukraine could count on his support, with France ""determined to help Ukraine to victory and the re-establishment of its legitimate rights"". Chancellor Scholz added: ""The position is unchanged: Russia must not win this war."" Because of the 11-month long Russian invasion, Mr Zelensky rarely leaves his own country and a senior Ukrainian official said that the purpose of his trip was to obtain results. He argues that fighter jets and long-range missiles are important in addition to the Leopard 2 tanks that Western nations have recently committed to supplying. While Mr Zelensky said he had discussed the issue of combat planes in Paris, he warned there was ""very little time"" to provide much-needed weaponry. The Dutch prime minister said that many sensitive issues had to be discussed before a decision could be made on supplying fighter jets. ""The pros and cons - you have to make absolutely sure that you are not getting into an Article Five direct confrontation between Nato and Russia,"" Mr Rutte told the BBC. Moscow has repeatably warned the West against weapons deliveries since the war began, frequently threatening to retaliate against what it calls ""provocations"".   Asked by reporters in Moscow about the growing debate over sending warplanes to Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia saw it as evidence of the growing involvement of the UK, France and Germany in the conflict. ""We regret this and state that such actions of these countries lead to the escalation of tension around this conflict, prolong it and make it more painful and torturous for Ukraine,"" said Mr Peskov. Chancellor Scholz agreed only recently to allow German Leopard tanks and has warned against getting involved in a ""public bidding war"" of weapons systems for Ukraine. Mr Zelensky had earlier addressed a joint session of the UK Parliament in Westminster Hall, underlining his plea for fighter jets: ""Freedom will win - we know Russia will lose.""  Downing Street said UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was investigating what aircraft could potentially be offered, but emphasised this was ""a long-term solution"" and that training pilots could take years.

Vladimir Putin issues chilling warning to UK over giving fighter jets to Ukraine,"The Russian Embassy in London issued a statement saying there would be 'military and political ramifications for the European continent and the entire globe' if the UK provides warplaneVladimir Putin has issued a chilling warning to the UK over its prospective plans to provide Ukraine with fighter jets to defend its country from Russian invaders.  Ukrainian president Volodomyr Zelensky reiterated his request for the airpower in a speech to the UK parliament on Wednesday.  But the Russian Embassy in London was quick to respond, issuing a statement warning the British government that a decision to provide the warplanes would be ""on London's conscience"" because of the ""bloodshed, next round of escalation, and subsequent military and political ramifications for the European continent and the entire globe"". The UK has not yet committed to providing the fighter jets to Ukraine, but on Wednesday Prime Minister Rishi Sunak insisted that ""nothing was off the table"" in his discussions with Zelensky.  Speaking during a joint press conference with the Ukrainian president, Mr Sunak said sending warplanes was “part of the conversation” between the pair.   Earlier in the day, Zelensky presented the speaker of the House of Commons with a helmet from the Ukrainian air force inscribed by a pilot with the words: ""We have freedom. Give us wings to protect it."" He told peers and MPs in Westminster Hall: “I appeal to you and the world with simple and yet most important words: combat aircraft for Ukraine, wings for freedom.”  Downing Street confirmed the Prime Minister had asked Defence Secretary Ben Wallace to investigate what jets the UK could potentially give to Ukraine in its struggle against invading Russian forces. Mr Zelensky said that without jets, there was a risk of “stagnation” in the conflict with Russia. Boris Johnson, who was prime minister at the outbreak of the conflict and a close ally of Mr Zelensky, urged the UK to give Ukraine the “tools to finish the job” of defeating the Kremlin’s troops.   “The faster we do it, the bigger the saving in life,” he told LBC. Mr Zelensky's surprise visit to the UK included a meeting with King Charles III.  Alluding to the King's former RAF experience, the Ukrainian president told those gathered in Westminster Hall: “The King is an air force pilot and in Ukraine today, every air force pilot is a king.” He added: “We know freedom will win. We know Russia will lose.” After visiting a training site for Ukranian troops in Dorset, Mr Sunak and Mr Zelensky later signed a declaration of unity, stating how London and Kyiv were “confident, that together with our allies and partners, we will defeat Russia’s illegal and unprovoked invasion”. The visit was only Mr Zelensky's second foreign trip outside of Ukraine since the invasion began just under a year ago.

"Petr Pavel: Ukraine deserves to join Nato, says new Czech leader","Czech President-elect Petr Pavel has told the BBC that Ukraine should be allowed to join Nato ""as soon as the war is over"".  Mr Pavel, a retired Nato general, said Ukraine would be ""morally and practically ready"" to join the Western alliance once the conflict had ended.  In his first broadcast interview with the international media since his election, Gen Pavel gave a robust defence of Western military support to Kyiv, saying there should be ""almost no limits"" to what countries should send.   Speaking from the renaissance Hrzansky Palace, a few hundred metres from Prague Castle, he said for him sending Western fighter planes such as F-16s was ""not taboo"", but he was unsure they could be delivered in a timeframe that could prove useful to Kyiv.  US President Joe Biden has ruled out sending F-16s this week, although France's Emmanuel Macron has said nothing is excluded. ""I am proud of my country being one of the first to provide Ukraine with significant military help,"" he told the BBC.   The Czech Republic was the first Western country to send tanks and infantry fighting vehicles - Soviet-designed T72s and BMP1s - to Kyiv, part of a series of deliveries of heavy weapons that reportedly began as early as March 2022.  Almost a year on, after much agonising and soul-searching, countries including the UK, the United States and Germany have begun answering Kyiv's repeated calls to send modern, Western-made tanks such as Leopard 2s, Challenger 2s and M1 Abrams.   ""Probably very few people could imagine that Western countries would be willing to provide Ukraine with modern main battle tanks or long-range artillery or anti-aircraft systems,"" he went on.  Now, he said, it was reality.   ""But at the same time we see it's still not enough"" to counter Russia's significant resources of men and materiel, he added.  He acknowledged Kyiv's disappointment at the speed of deliveries, especially Western tanks, which were explicitly designed to punch holes - literally and figuratively - through Soviet armoured formations.  Ukraine has asked for 300 such tanks and says the West has so far promised to send at least 120. But Gen Pavel said he hoped that would speed up - especially if Russia launches its anticipated spring offensive.   The president-elect brushed aside the view - long held in some European capitals, especially Berlin - that such deliveries could be seen as ""escalation"".  Russia has warned that increased supplies of Western weapons will lead to Nato countries increasingly becoming directly involved in the conflict. ""We have no alternative,"" he said. ""If we leave Ukraine without assistance, they would most probably lose this war. And if they lose - we all lose.""  President-elect Pavel also said that he and other European leaders had a duty to explain to their sceptical - and in many cases frightened populations - of the sense in helping Ukraine.  ""Our cities are not being destroyed by Russian artillery and missiles. But our future could be destroyed if we don't support Ukraine to a successful end to this conflict.""  And he also dismissed claims - among them from the man who stood against him this weekend, former Prime Minister Andrej Babis - that he was closing the door to diplomacy.  ""Once there is even the slightest chance of peace talks, let's support it. But there are no signs of it from the Russian side,"" said Mr Pavel, who was often portrayed as a warmonger during the campaign.  ""What needs to be said is this: the end of war is entirely in Russian hands. It would take only one decision from President Putin to withdraw his forces from Ukraine and the war is over.""  And once it was over, he told the BBC, he could see a clear place for Ukraine in Nato.  ""The Ukrainian military will be probably the most experienced military in Europe. Ukraine deserves to be part of a community of democratic countries.""     Including Nato? I asked.  ""I believe they really deserve it.""  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64455121,
Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 351 of the invasion,"Zelenskiy calls for combat jets from west during tour of Europe; Nato chief says Russia is preparing for a new military offensive. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has used a visit to Paris to urge Europe to deliver combat aircraft and heavy arms to Ukraine as soon as possible. “The sooner Ukraine gets long-range heavy weaponry, the sooner our pilots get planes, the sooner this Russian aggression will end and we can return to peace in Europe,” the Ukrainian president said as he arrived at the Élysée Palace on Wednesday. Zelenskiy met with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, urging them to be “game changers” by sending modern planes and then “the quicker this Russian aggression will end”. Macron said Paris would “continue the efforts” to deliver arms to Kyiv, adding that France was determined to help Ukraine towards “victory, peace and Europe”. “Russia cannot and must not win,” he said, adding that “the future of Europe” was at stake in Ukraine. Scholz said it was clear that Moscow would not win, and assured Ukraine its future was in the EU, saying Ukraine was part of the “European family”. “Putin will not achieve his goals – not on the battlefield and not through a dictated peace.” Zelenskiy said Macron had undergone a significant change in his stance towards Ukraine after the French president had sought to keep channels open to Russia in the early phase of the conflict. “I think he [Macron] has changed,” Zelenskiy said in an interview published in Le Figaro on Wednesday night. “And he’s changed for real this time. After all, he opened the door to tank deliveries. He also supported Ukraine’s candidacy for the EU. I believe it was a real signal. We had a lot of conversations with France, Germany and other countries. I believe that trust is real today.” Zelenskiy also made an emotional appeal to the UK to supply Ukraine with fighter jets on a surprise visit to the UK earlier on Wednesday. “I appeal to you and the world with simple and yet most important words: combat aircrafts – for Ukraine! Wings – for freedom!” he said. Rishi Sunak, previously opposed to handing over UK jets, has ordered a defence ministry review into whether Zelenskiy’s request can be met, saying “nothing was off the table”. Pledges of support by Sunak, the UK prime minister, included training Ukrainian pilots on advanced Nato fighter jets “to ensure Ukraine can defend its skies well into the future”. Sunak added: “The first step in being able to provide advanced aircrafts is to have soldiers or aviators that are capable of using them. That is a process. It takes some time, we’ve started that process today.” The expansion of the UK’s training programme to include fighter pilots is significant as Zelenskiy has repeatedly called on western countries to supply planes. The UK has so far refused, arguing that the RAF’s F-35 and Typhoon jets take too long for pilots to train on. Sunak also confirmed that UK Challenger 2 tanks would be deployed in Ukraine next month. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said there was no sign of Russia preparing for peace. “On the contrary, Moscow is preparing for new military offensives,” he said during a joint press conference with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken. Zelenskiy was expected to travel to Brussels on Thursday, with leaders of EU countries due there for a summit. A senior Ukrainian official said the president would ask for more arms to fight Russia and for the EU to move quickly on Ukraine’s bid to join. Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, would meet with Zelenskiy on the sidelines of a European Council meeting, a government source told Reuters.

Both the French president and German chancellor have at times faced criticism for being too slow to support Ukraine.  Mr Zelensky has previously expressed frustration with Mr Macron, who continued to hold phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin after the invasion.

Zelenskiy meets Macron and Scholz and repeats appeal for aircraft and arms,"Ukrainian president urges Europe to send ‘long-range heavy weaponry’ as Macron says Europe’s future at stake. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has used a visit to Paris to urge Europe to deliver combat aircraft and heavy arms to Ukraine as soon as possible. “The sooner Ukraine gets long-range heavy weaponry, the sooner our pilots get planes, the sooner this Russian aggression will end and we can return to peace in Europe,” the Ukrainian president said as he arrived at the Elysée Palace on Wednesday after a day of diplomacy in London. On his first visit to Europe since the Russian invasion began almost one year ago, Zelenskiy met the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, together and appealed for more heavy arms. Macron was firm in his support of Zelenskiy, saying France was determined to help Ukraine towards “victory, peace and Europe” as well as “the re-establishment of its legitimate rights”. He said Paris would “continue the efforts” to deliver arms to Kyiv, without giving more detail. Macron added: “Russia cannot and must not win.” He said “the future of Europe” was at stake in Ukraine. Scholz called Ukraine part of the “European family”. He said Germany and its partners had backed Ukraine “financially, with humanitarian aid and with weapons”, adding: “We will continue to do so as long as necessary.” Zelenskiy arrived late in the evening in Paris for a hastily organised working dinner at the Elysée with Macron and Scholz after visiting London, where he had made an emotional appeal for Britain and “the world” to supply Ukraine with fighter jets. Germany recently gave the green light for Leopard battle tanks to be sent to Ukraine after an intense campaign by Zelenskiy and allied countries. Germany’s defence minister said Berlin hoped to deliver the first tank battalion to Ukraine by April. In an interview published in Le Figaro on Wednesday night, Zelenskiy said Macron had undergone a significant change on his stance towards Ukraine after the French president had sought to keep channels open to Russia in the early phase of the conflict. Zelenskiy had at times over the past year shown impatience with Macron, who had held frequent telephone talks with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, even after the invasion and had expressed concern that Russia should not be humiliated in any final settlement. But Macron in recent months had indicated that France wanted to support Ukraine “all the way to victory” and would send light tanks, in a move that prompted Germany to follow suit with battle tanks. after newsletter promotion “I think he [Macron] has changed,” Zelenskiy told Le Figaro. “And he’s changed for real this time. After all, he opened the door to tank deliveries. He also supported Ukraine’s candidacy for the EU. I believe it was a real signal.

I believe that trust is real today.” At the beginning of February, Paris pledged to deliver 12 new Caesar howitzer artillery systems, in addition to the 18 already delivered. And it is also not ruling out the transfer of fighter aircraft to Kyiv, which was previously a red line. Ahead of the 24 February anniversary of Russia’s invasion, Scholz said it was clear that Moscow would not win, and assured Ukraine its future was in the EU. He said in a speech to the German parliament: “Putin will not achieve his goals – not on the battlefield and not through a dictated peace. That much, at least, is certain after a year of war.” Zelenskiy was to spend the night in Paris before heading to Brussels on Thursday morning, where he was to attend an EU summit and urge the European Council, made up of the 27 leaders of the EU’s member states, to speed up arms deliveries to Ukraine.

Mortgages: What happens if I miss a payment?,"The average interest rate charged by mortgage lenders is now much higher than many homeowners have been used to. So what can those struggling to make repayments do - and how must their mortgage provider help out? There are different types of mortgages - all of which have become more costly in recent months. Mortgage rates have risen and the 1.6 million people on tracker or variable deals are paying much more than a year ago.  The estimated 1.8 million homeowners coming to the end of a fixed deal this year face moving to a much higher monthly bill.  That is difficult to answer. Analysts expect Bank of England interest rates to peak at about 4.5% this summer.  For anyone on tracker deals, at least, that means higher repayments to come. Recent data indicates that rates on fixed-rate deals have fallen slightly after surging last year. House prices have also started to fall as higher interest rates put off buyers. The Nationwide Building Society says that property prices have fallen for five months in a row. However, a decade or so of ultra-low mortgage rates - which many homeowners have become accustomed to - is clearly over. There is a smaller choice, but still plenty of options depending on your circumstances. An agreement between lenders, the Treasury and regulators means people can switch to a new fixed-rate mortgage, without a new affordability test, when their current deal ends, as long as they are up to date with payments. A shortfall equivalent to two or more months' repayments means you are officially in arrears. But your lender must make reasonable attempts to reach an agreement with you. In fact, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) - which regulates mortgage lenders - has said they must treat customers fairly. Crucially, customers must contact their lender as soon as they realise they are going to struggle to make repayments - the earlier the better. Trained and experienced staff must be on hand to help. Within 15 working days of falling into arrears, your lender must: Your lender must then treat you fairly by considering any requests about changing how you pay, perhaps with lower repayments for a short period. Any arrangement you come to, the FCA points out, will be reflected on your credit file - affecting your ability to borrow money in the future - as will any missed payments. Your lender might also suggest or allow you to extend the term of the mortgage or let you pay just the interest for a certain period of time. A mortgage payment holiday enables customers to delay repayments - but not indefinitely. Lenders may offer this option, depending on individual circumstances - and not to those already in arrears - but the level of support offered during the Covid pandemic has been reduced. Again, this will show on your credit file.  The devolved governments run some mortgage-support schemes - but the criteria can be complex. Here is a guide from the government-backed Moneyhelper website. Some people may decide to sell their home and - in extreme circumstances - the lender could take court action to repossess it. Repossessions are far rarer than they used to be. There are lots of stages before a lender can take such action and the whole process takes about two years. But if you think your home is at risk, it is well worth getting free, independent debt advice. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63486782,
Mortgage rates fall below 4% for first time in five months – full list of major banks slashing deals now,"MORTGAGE rates have fallen below 4% for the first time in five months. Lenders are battling it out to offer households the best mortgage deals in months, even as interest rates have risen. The Bank of England hiked its base rate for the tenth time in a row to 4% in January in a bid to tackle inflation. It now expects it to peak at 4.5% before falling to 3.25% over the next three years. The base rate is used by lenders to price the rates offered to customers on savings and loans including mortgages.  Usually, a rise in the base rate is passed on to consumers, but banks are dropping interest rates instead. This is because the Bank of England has lowered its forecasts on how interest rates will peak from 6% to 4.5% since the disastrous mini-Budget which caused mortgage rates to shoot up to a 14-year high. HSBC has announced that it is offering those remortgaging a five-year fixed deal at 3.99% to 60% LTV with a £999 fee. It comes only days after Lloyds Bank and Virgin Money slashed their 10-year mortgage to 3.99%. This is good news for home buyers and mortgage holders looking to refinance. The average two and five-year fixed rates fell month-on-month for the third month running, down to 5.42% and 5.14% respectively - down from 5.79% and 5.63% respectively last month. Keep in mind that the exact mortgage rate you can get depends on your personal financial circumstances. Rachel Springall, finance expert at MoneyFacts said: ""It’s encouraging to see fixed mortgage rates coming down for borrowers looking to secure a new deal. ""A five-year fixed rate mortgage is a great choice for those looking for peace of mind to fix their monthly repayments. ""Due to the unpredictable nature of the mortgage arena, it is imperative that both those looking to purchase a property or who wish to refinance seek independent advice from a broker to navigate the options available to them.” The news comes as more than 1.4million mortgage holders face new bill hikes of around £250 a month. The majority of fixed-rate mortgages in the UK (57%) which are coming up for renewal in 2023 were fixed at interest rates below 2%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). But the Bank of England has been forced to raise interest rates in a bid to tackle inflation. The base rate is now at its highest level seen since October 2008, when it stood at 4.5%. Borrowers on fixed-rate mortgages have been cushioned from the immediate impact so far.  But, they'll get a shock when they come to renew as average fixed rates are more than double what they were two years ago. This resulted from the previous government's disastrous mini-Budget which caused mortgage rates to shoot up to a 14-year high in September. The Bank of England expects mortgage rates to fall back to 3.25% in three years' time - bringing a new sigh of relief for mortgage holders and paving way for lenders to cut mortgage deals. If you have a fixed rate, you could see higher rates when you come to the end of the current term. Around 2.2million borrowers are due to come to the end of a deal that they fixed when the base rate was at a historic low of 0.1%. But if you're nearing the end of a fixed deal soon, you may be wondering if it's worth looking for another one now. David Hollingworth of broker L&C Mortgages said: ""Although those coming to the end of a fixed rate taken during the low in rates of recent years, will still be faced with higher payments than they have been used to, it’s a far cry from the prospect of rates at 6% or more. ""Those borrowers that understandably decided to sit on their hands when rates went through the roof last October, should now seriously consider if it’s time to take advantage of these significant improvements."" Getting the best rate on your mortgage can depend on the rates available at the time, but there are several ways to land the best deal. Usually the larger the deposit you have the lower the rate you can get. If you're remortgaging and your loan-to-value ratio has changed this could also give you access to better rates than before. A change to your credit score or a better salary could also help you access better rates. If you have a fixed rate, you could see higher rates when you come to the end of the current term after the BoE rise., either when shopping for a new fixed deal or reverting to the standard variable rate (SVR). But if you're nearing the end of a fixed deal soon it's worth looking now. You can lock in current deals sometimes up to six months before your current deal ends. Fixed rates have historically been cheaper than SVRs, but that may not be the case now, so its worth comparing the costs, and how long you want to be locked in for. Leaving a fixed deal early will usually come with an early exit fee, so you want to avoid this extra cost. But depending on the cost and how much you could save by switching versus sticking, it could be worth paying to leave the deal - but compare the costs first. To find the best deal use a mortgage comparison tool to see what's available. You can also got to a mortgage broker who can compare for you, but you may have to pay for this service. It could cost a couple of hundred pounds but it might save you thousands on you mortgage overall. You'll also need to factor in fees for the mortgage, though some have no fees at all, or you can add it on to the cost of the mortgage, but beware that means you'll pay interest on it and so will cost more in the long term. You can use a mortgage calculator to see how much you could borrow. Remember, that you'll have to pass the lender's strict eligibility criteria too, which will include affordability checks, and looking at your credit file. You may also need to provide documents such as utility bills, proof of benefits, your last three month's payslips, passports and bank statement.

Martin Lewis issues urgent warning for anyone waiting for cheap mortgage rates to return,"MARTIN Lewis has issued an urgent warning for anyone waiting for cheap mortgage rates to return. The consumer champion said on the latest episode of the Martin Lewis Money Show that people shouldn't delay taking out a new mortgage deal. The founder of MoneySavingExpert said: ""I've been quite concerned over recent months of many people who have got in touch with me in recent months who said I'll stick on the standard variable until rates go back to the cheap rates that we had."" ""I need to be very plain. If you're under 35 you might not realise that the rates we had from 2008 until last year, they were low. ""They were limbo-ing well below the prior 300-year historic lows for interest rates. ""We have lived through an anomaly time so there is absolutely no rule that says things must go back to how they were. I'm not saying they won't, but there is no rule that it must."" The average two-year fixed-rate in December 2021 was 2.34%, but by December 2022 it reached 5.84%. But Martin's advice comes after mortgage rates fell below 4% for the first time in five months this week. HSBC announced that it is offering those remortgaging a five-year fixed deal at 3.99% to 60% LTV with a £999 fee. And Lloyds Bank and Virgin Money slashed their 10-year mortgage deals to 3.99%. But keep in mind that the exact mortgage rate you can get depends on your personal financial circumstances. This is good news for home buyers and mortgage holders looking to refinance. And Martin warned that those looking to buy or remortgage shouldn't speculate that rates will fall back to levels seen in 2021. Lenders have been cutting rates even though the Bank of England hiked its base rate for the tenth time in a row to 4% in January in a bid to tackle inflation.

You can now get a mortgage with a rate below 4%... but homeowners will need to fix for 10 years: Is it worth it?,"At the start of the year, a popular topic of discussion among property experts was whether rates on fixed mortgages would fall back below 4 per cent. They didn't have to wait long, as within the first five weeks Virgin Money released one at 3.99 per cent - although anyone taking it out will need to fix for a decade. The rapid rise of interest rates following the Autumn mini-Budget saw the average for both two and five-year fixed rates soar to over 6.5 per cent in October. However, rates have been steadily falling since then despite successive base rate increases from the Bank of England. There is yet to have been a two or five-year fixed mortgage with a sub-4 per cent rate this year. In February, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate was 5.44 per cent with the five-year fix at 5.2 per cent, according to Moneyfacts. But looking at the cheapest rates on the market, some lenders are beginning to come close to breaking the 4 per cent barrier. Lender Platform currently offers a five-year fixed deal at 4.16 per cent for those with a 40 per cent deposit, while Newcastle Building Society has a two-year fix at 4.35 per cent. And the next best ten-year fix after Virgin is Halifax, offering 4.04 per cent.While brokers expect mortgage rates to continue falling despite the Bank of England signaling the base rate has not yet peaked, there is a general consensus that mortgage rates will settle somewhere below 5 per cent.Five-year mortgage swap rates are currently at around 3.5 per cent, suggesting that this is where banks believe interest rates will be in five years' time.But as we saw in the Autumn events can change rapidly, and no one can ever say with certainty where rates will be at any one point in the future.So if you are remortgaging or buying a home, is it worth going for a 10-year deal?The strongest argument in favour of fixing your mortgage for 10 years is the certainty it brings. If your current house is going to be your 'forever home' and you want to put in place a plan to pay off the mortgage by a certain date, a ten-year fix offers you the ability to plan long-term.It also insulates you from any future rate rises. For the next year or so, many brokers say interest rates between four and five per cent will be  the 'new normal' - so it could allow you to lock in your mortgage at that kind of level. However, it is harder to predict where mortgage rates will go further into the future. If they fell, you would be stuck paying over the odds and would not be able to leave the mortgage without paying an early repayment charge.That may be easier to swallow for those who don't have long left on their mortgage term, and may be paying less each month.  'Tying yourself into a 10-year will only be sensible for those coming to the end of their mortgage that want the security to know what they are paying and not have to review,' says mortgages technical director at John Charcoal, Nicholas Mendes.For first-time buyers or those who are on the second wrung of the property ladder, a cheap ten-year fixed rate may sound appealing.But at the moment, the Virgin Money deal and Halifax's rate - the next cheapest - are only for those with large or medium deposits. For borrowers who need more than 75 per cent loan-to-value the price of a 10 year fix rises to around 4.82 per cent, more expensive than many of the shorter fixed-term deals.The lack of flexibility in the product could also impact borrowers' decision making.Having children or needing to move for a job can change what you want from your property, and a decade is a long time to commit to one house. Some long term deals allow you to port the mortgage to a new property, but it will still need to fit the lenders' requirements so can't always be guaranteed. If homeowners have a sudden change of circumstances such as a significant salary increase or job loss, they could find themselves trapped by eye-watering early repayment charges to escape the loan.Riz Malik director at R3 Mortgages says, 'It can be tempting to consider long-term fixed rates and many people did last year when rates were volatile. 'However, these products usually come with tiered or flat early repayment charges. This means if your circumstances change you could be left paying a big penalty to exit the deal.'The second big risk is that rates fall significantly and you end up overpaying for your mortgage, compared to those who are able to take out new loans. Although it is currently expected that fixed rates on mortgages will sit between 4 per cent and 5 per cent, some experts expect prices to fall through 2023 and in to next year. This makes it more beneficial to fix for a shorter period, giving you the flexibility to change if rates fall.'The price war is well and truly in full swing with lenders consistently looking to undercut each other at the moment as they fight for mortgage share in a quieter mortgage market,' says Jamie Lennox, director at Dimora Mortgages.'People will need to think carefully before fixing for such a long duration. The promising outlook is that it may not be that long before other lenders join Virgin money with sub 4 per cent rates and that we may even see shorter-term fixes follow suit.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/mortgageshome/article-11718089/Theres-mortgage-rate-4-worth-fixing-10-years-it.html,

 Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 347 of the invasion,"Arming Ukraine is swiftest path to peace, says UK foreign secretary; Ukraine warns of renewed Russian offensive this month. Helping to arm Ukraine so it can defend itself against Russia is the swiftest path to achieving peace, the British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has said, writing in the Times of Malta before a visit on Tuesday to the Mediterranean island. -----------------------------1Ukraine will not use longer-range weapons pledged by the United States to hit Russian territory and will only target Russian units in occupied Ukrainian territory, said Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov. -----------------------------2Ukraine expects a possible major Russian offensive this month, but Kyiv has the reserves to hold back Moscow’s forces even though not all the west’s latest military supplies will have arrived in time, Reznikov said. -----------------------------3Germany’s prosecutor general, Peter Frank, told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper his office had collected “hundreds” of pieces of evidence showing war crimes by Russian forces in Ukraine. -----------------------------4The former Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett said Vladimir Putin made him a promise he would not try to kill Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during a trip to Moscow shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine last year. -----------------------------5The head of Russia’s private Wagner militia said fierce fighting was continuing in the northern parts of the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, which has been the focus of Russian forces’ attention for weeks. Yevgeniy Prigozhin rejected reports in the Russian media that Ukrainian troops were abandoning Bakhmut, saying: “Fierce battles are going on in the northern quarters for every street, every house, every stairwell.” -----------------------------6The situation on the frontlines in the east of the country was getting tougher and Russia was throwing more and more troops into battle, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Saturday. -----------------------------7The embattled eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut has become “increasingly isolated”, according to the latest assessment by the UK Ministry of Defence. “Over the last week, Russia has continued to make small advances in its attempt to encircle the Donbas town of Bakhmut,” the MoD wrote on Twitter on Sunday. -----------------------------8Ukrainian forces remained in control of the village of Bilohorivka, the Luhansk region governor, Serhiy Haidai, said, adding that the situation there was tense but under control. -----------------------------9Zelenskiy has revoked the citizenship of several former influential politicians. He would not list the names but said they had dual Russian citizenship. -----------------------------10The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said Putin “has not made any threats against me or Germany” in his telephone conversations with the Russian president, Bild am Sonntag reported. The former British prime minister Boris Johnson, speaking to the BBC for a documentary broadcast last week, said the Russian leader had threatened him with a missile strike that would “only take a minute”. The Kremlin said Johnson was lying. -----------------------------11Price caps on Russian oil probably hit Moscow’s revenues from oil and gas exports by nearly 30% in January, or about $8bn (£7bn), compared with a year before, the International Energy Agency (IEA) chief, Fatih Birol, said on Sunday. -----------------------------12The European Union took another big step toward cutting its energy ties with Russia.

"Ukraine war: Russia planning 24 February offensive, Ukrainian defence minister says","Ukraine's defence minister has said Russia is preparing a major new offensive, and warned that it could begin as soon as 24 February. Oleksii Reznikov said Moscow had amassed thousands of troops and could ""try something"" to mark the anniversary of the initial invasion last year.  The attack would also mark Russia's Defender of the Fatherland Day on 23 February, which celebrates the army.  Meanwhile, three people have died in an attack on the city of Kramatorsk. Eight others were wounded in the city in Donetsk region after a Russian missile struck a residential building, the provincial governor said.  The toll is expected to rise as rescuers comb through the wreckage. ""The only way to stop Russian terrorism is to defeat it,"" Mr Zelensky wrote on social media about the attack. ""By tanks. Fighter jets. Long-range missiles."" Ukraine has recently renewed calls for fighter jets to help protect itself from air attacks after Germany, the US and the UK agreed to send them tanks.  Mr Reznikov said Moscow had mobilised some 500,000 troops for the potential offensive. In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a general mobilisation of some 300,000 conscripted troops, which he said was necessary to ensure the country's ""territorial integrity"".  But Mr Reznikov suggested that the true figure recruited and deployed to Ukraine could be far higher.  ""Officially they announced 300,000 but when we see the troops at the borders, according to our assessments it is much more,"" he told the French BFM network. The BBC cannot independently verify this figure.  Russia has claimed recent gains in the eastern Donbas region and its forces say they are moving in on the front-line town of Bakhmut after a battle that has lasted months and led to heavy loss of life on both sides. Last month, Russian mercenaries and regular soldiers seized the nearby town of Soledar and on Wednesday a Russian-appointed official, Yan Gagin, said Bakhmut was ""operationally surrounded"". The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) recently said that Moscow could seek to ""undertake a decisive action"" and launch a ""big offensive"" in the east.  Mr Reznikov said Ukraine's commanders would seek to ""stabilise the front and prepare for a counter-offensive"" ahead of the rumoured Russian advance.  ""I have faith that the year 2023 can be the year of military victory,"" he said, adding that Ukraine's forces ""cannot lose the initiative"" they have achieved in recent months.  The defence minister was in France to strike a deal to purchase additional MG-200 air defence radars, which he said would ""significantly increase the capacity of the armed forces to detect air targets, including winged and ballistic missiles, and drones of various types"".  Mr Reznikov's comments come as Ukrainian intelligence alleges that President Putin has ordered his forces to seize the Donbas before the end of spring.  But speaking on Monday, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that there were no indications that Mr Putin had limited his military goals to seizing eastern regions of Ukraine. ""That they are actively acquiring new weapons, more ammunition, ramping up their own production, but also acquiring more weapons from other authoritarian states like Iran and North Korea,"" Mr Stoltenberg said.  ""And most of all, we have seen no sign that President Putin has changed his overall goal of this invasion - that is to control a neighbour, to control Ukraine. So as long as this is the case, we need to be prepared for the long haul."" Meanwhile, Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar said that intense fighting was continuing in the Donbas region, where Russian forces and Wagner Group mercenaries have been trying to take the town of Bakhmut.  She added that Moscow's troops were also trying to seize Lyman - the former Russian logistics hub that Ukrainian troops retook in October.  ""Russian troops are actively trying to reach the borders of Donetsk and Luhansk regions,"" she wrote on the Telegram messaging app. ""Our soldiers defend every centimetre of Ukrainian land,"" she said.  Speaking on Wednesday night, Mr Zelensky warned that the situation on the front lines of the conflict was testing his forces.  ""There is a certain increase in the occupiers' offensive actions at the front - in the east of our country, Mr Zelensky said. ""The situation is becoming even more severe."" While the Wagner group has claimed it has been heavily involved in Russia's recent advances in the east, a former commander who fled to Norway has told Reuters that he witnessed the killing and mistreatment of Russian prisoners taken to Ukraine to fight for the group.  Andrei Medvedev made an unverified claim that in the four months he was with Wagner, he saw two people who didn't want to fight being shot.  About 80% of Wagner's personnel in Ukraine have been drawn from prisons, according to the US National Security Council. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64492938,
Ukraine confirms Putin planning February 'anniversary' attack with half a million troops,"Ukraine's defence minister has warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin has amassed half a million troops and could use them for an 'anniversary' attack on the countryUkraine has confirmed fears that Russian President Vladimir Putin may be planning a February 24 'anniversary' attack on the country with half a million troops. Ukraine’s defence minister Oleksii Reznikov has said that Moscow has amassed hundreds of thousands of troops and could “try something” on the one year anniversary of its invasion. The major new offensive would mark another phase of the ongoing war, and comes after prolonged fears Russia might utilise the anniversary date to renew their efforts to take Ukraine. The Kremlin shocked the world when, in February last year, it invaded the country and tried to seize Kyiv as apart of what it claimed was a ""special military operation"". Any attack would also mark Russia’s Defender of the Fatherland Day on February 23 - which celebrates the army.   Mr Reznikov said the Kremlin has gathered half a million troops for the potential offensive. In September last year, Putin announced a general mobilisation that bolstered his forces by an estimated 300,000 soldiers. But Mr Reznikov warned the true figure could be far higher than this. Speaking to the BFM Network in France, he said: ""Officially they announced 300,000 but when we see the troops at the borders, according to our assessments it is much more,"". This comes as NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned there had been no indication that Putin had been deterred from his goal of total conquest of Ukraine.  He said: ""That they are actively acquiring new weapons, more ammunition, ramping up their own production, but also acquiring more weapons from other authoritarian states like Iran and North Korea. ""And most of all, we have seen no sign that President Putin has changed his overall goal of this invasion - that is to control a neighbour, to control Ukraine. So as long as this is the case, we need to be prepared for the long haul."" The fighting itself has reached something of a stalemate in recent months despite heavy conflict in the Donbas region in the east of Ukraine. Neither side has made significant territorial advances apart from Russia's seizure of the town of Soledar.  But Mr Reznikov said Ukraine was hoping to ""stabilise the front and prepare for a counter offensive."" He added: ""I have faith that the year 2023 can be the year of military victory,"". The defence minister was in France to strike a deal to purchase more MG-200 air defence radars which Mr Reznikov said would ""significantly increase the capacity of the armed forces to detect air targets, including winged and ballistic missiles, and drones of various types"". Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar said that the infamous Wagner Group were supporting Russian forces in the intense fighting taking part in the Donbas region.  The Mirror recently revealed that the mercenary group were secretly developing ""swarm drones"" in a shadowy arms deal with Chinese spies. Putin's forces have been desperately trying to seize the town of Bakhmut, in the region, and Lyman, a former Russian logistics hub that Ukraine took back in October. On Telegram she wrote: ""Russian troops are actively trying to reach the borders of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Our soldiers defend every centimetre of Ukrainian land,"".

Ukraine braced for renewed Russian offensive later in February,"Ukraine's outgoing defence minister has said the country is anticipating a new Russian offensive later this month. At a news conference, Oleksiy Reznikov said not all Western weaponry will have arrived by then, but Ukraine had enough reserves to hold off Russian forces. President Volodymyr Zelensky said troops were fighting fiercely in Bakhmut, Vuhledar and Lyman. Mr Reznikov's comments came hours before it was announced that he was to be replaced as defence minister. Military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov will take his place, according to a Ukrainian politician from Mr Zelensky's party. The shake-up comes amid a series of corruption scandals that has plagued the defence ministry.  Mr Reznikov has denied media reports that some defence officials are suspected of embezzling public funds for the procurement of food for the army. Ukrainian lawmaker David Arakhamia announced the reshuffle on Sunday, saying that ""war dictates personnel policies"". Mr Reznikov, a familiar face in Ukraine's efforts to secure Western weapons, will now become minister for strategic industries. President Zelensky has already fired a number of senior officials as part of a broad anti-corruption drive across his government.  At an earlier news conference, Mr Reznikov said Russia did not have all of its resources ready to launch an offensive, but may do so anyway as a symbolic gesture, given the one-year anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion on 24 February. He said Russia was expected to prioritise taking the whole of the eastern Donbas as well as launching offensives in the south of Ukraine. Mr Reznikov made similar comments to French TV earlier this month. The defence minister also confirmed that troops would start training on German-made Leopard tanks from Monday. Mr Reznikov said Ukraine had secured new long-range missiles with a range of 90-mile (150km), but they will not be used against Russian territory - only against Russian units in occupied areas of Ukraine. ""I am sure that we will win this war,"" said Mr Reznikov, but he added that without the delivery of Western fighter jets, ""it will cost us more lives"".  Despite the flow of Western weapons to Ukraine, Russia has made gains around the Bakhmut area in recent days, as Russia's army throws more and more soldiers into combat. Russia's paramilitary mercenary group Wagner have led much of the fighting in the area. Its head, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said there are fierce battles for every street in some areas of the city, and Ukraine's armed forces were ""fighting to the last"". Russian forces have been attempting to seize control of Bakhmut for months - making it the longest battle since Russia invaded Ukraine almost a year ago. Taking the area is important to Russia as part of its aim to control the whole of the Donbas region. It would also signify a turnaround in Russia's fortunes after it lost ground in Ukraine during recent months. Speaking during his nightly address, President Zelensky said: ""Things are very difficult in Donetsk region - fierce battles."" But, he added, ""we have no alternative to defending ourselves and winning"". The UK's Ministry of Defence said Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut are getting increasingly isolated as the Russians continue to make small advances in its attempt to encircle the town. It added that the two main roads into Bakhmut were likely being threatened by direct fire. In other developments: You may also be interested in: ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64528580,
Ukraine war: Russians seen reinforcing east ahead of offensive,"Tens of thousands of Russians are being sent to eastern Ukraine as part of an offensive planned after 15 February, according to the Ukrainian governor of Luhansk region. ""We are seeing more and more reserves being deployed in our direction,"" said Serhiy Haidai, who expected a three-pronged Russian advance. Ukraine has warned repeatedly of an imminent offensive. But there is widespread scepticism of significant Russian success. The UK's defence intelligence briefing said Russia's aim was almost certainly to capture parts of Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region that were not already under occupation. But the UK said ""it remains unlikely that Russia can build up the forces needed to substantially affect the outcome of the war within the coming weeks"". Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said seven Ukrainians towns had been ""liberated"" in recent weeks and operations were progressing ""with success"" in two more, Bakhmut and Vuhledar. For six months, Russian mercenaries -now joined by regular troops - have tried to capture Bakhmut, a small city with a pre-war population of 70,000.  Now a Ukrainian commander, Denis Yaroslavskiy, has said only 2,000 civilians remain and Russian forces have captured parts of the east and north of the city and continue to move forward. The head of Russia's Wagner mercenary force said this week that Ukrainian forces were not in retreat anywhere in the city and fierce battles were taking place for every street, house and stairwell. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the military was paying close attention to Russia's attempt to encircle Bakhmut. ""We are countering them,"" he said on Monday night. He announced that leaders with military experience were being appointed in border and front-line regions, who could ""prove themselves"" against current threats from Russia. Ukrainian forces said on Tuesday they had shot down a Russian combat aircraft over Bakhmut, but there was no independent confirmation.  Russian forces have made little progress in Ukraine since their retreat from the major southern city of Kherson last November. Last month they captured the town of Soledar north of Bakhmut after an intense battle. Almost a year into Russia's invasion, an estimated 300,000 Russian reserve troops have been recruited in recent months in an attempt to break through Ukraine's front lines in the east. Capturing Bakhmut could enable Russian forces to press on towards the bigger cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk. Mr Haidai said the Russians' two-month training period was coming to an end and Moscow would need around 10 days to transfer them to the front for a new offensive. He suggested that in Luhansk region they would target three towns: Bilohorivka, Kreminna and Svatove. President Zelensky has appealed to Western countries to hurry sending heavy weaponry to Ukraine to help Ukraine repel Russia's expected offensive. The US agreed last week to send long-range missiles that will enable Ukraine to double its attack range. The Russian defence minister warned that Western heavy weapons were drawing Nato countries into the conflict and ""could lead to an unpredictable level of its escalation"".

Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 348 of the invasion,"Ukraine’s defence minister to be reshuffled into another job, Zelenskiy ally says; Ukraine braces for possible major Russian offensive this month. Russian forces are attempting to tie down Ukrainian forces with fighting in the eastern Donbas region, Ukraine has said. Moscow is reportedly assembling additional troops there for an expected offensive in the coming weeks, perhaps targeting the Luhansk region. “The battles for the region are heating up,” said Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Donetsk, on Monday. In Luhansk, fellow governor Serhiy Haidai said shelling there had subsided because “the Russians have been saving ammunition for a large-scale offensive”. -----------------------------1Weeks of intense fighting continued to rage around the city of Bakhmut and the nearby towns of Soledar and Vuhledar, Ukraine’s presidential office said. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said on Monday that Russia was continuing to make small advances in its efforts to encircle the Donbas city of Bakhmut. “While multiple alternative cross-country supply routes remain available to Ukrainian forces, Bakhmut is increasingly isolated,” the ministry said on Twitter. -----------------------------2The western area of the Luhansk region is likely to be the focus of any new Russian offensive, said Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence, who has been tipped to take over the Ministry of Defence. In an interview with the Financial Times, he said that offensive would most likely be launched by “proper mechanised brigades” rather than the ill-trained reservists and Wagner mercenaries who have been suffering heavy casualties in recent battles. -----------------------------3Ukraine is bracing for a possible Russian offensive this month before the first anniversary of its invasion of Ukraine. “There are already many reports that the occupiers want to do something symbolic in February to try to avenge their last year’s defeats,” the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in his Sunday night address. “We see this increased pressure in various areas of the frontline, as well as pressure in the information field.” -----------------------------4Ukraine has faced temperatures as low as -20C (-4F) this winter, at the same time as dealing with a humanitarian crisis as Russia hits vital civilian infrastructure, analysis has shown. Areas in Dnipro, Donetsk and Kharkiv are particularly vulnerable, according to research. Some areas are housing tens of thousands of displaced people through the winter, at the same time as crucial infrastructure – including energy and housing – is being targeted by Russian missiles and artillery. -----------------------------5Kyiv has the reserves to hold back Moscow’s forces even though the latest western military supplies will not all arrive in time, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has claimed. “Not all of the western weaponry will arrive in time. But we are ready. We have created our resources and reserves, which we are able to deploy and with which we are able to hold back the attack.” Reznikov added that the attack would be for “symbolic” reasons but its resources were not ready from a military point of view. “Despite everything, we expect a possible Russian offensive in February. This is only from the point of view of symbolism; it’s not logical from a military view. Because not all of their resources are ready. But they’re doing it anyway,” he said. -----------------------------6Reznikov, under pressure from a corruption scandal, is to be reshuffled into another government job, a close ally of Zelenskiy announced on Sunday. Reznikov will be replaced by Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine’s military intelligence. His position had been under threat after it emerged the defence ministry paid twice or three times the supermarket price of food to supply troops on the frontline. On Monday, David Arakhamia said any replacement of Reznikov would not take place this week. -----------------------------7The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said the world risked walking into a “wider war” over Ukraine. Addressing the UN general assembly just weeks before the first anniversary of Russia’s 24 February invasion, Guterres said: “The prospects for peace keep diminishing. The chances of further escalation and bloodshed keep growing.” -----------------------------8The EU’s legislature is preparing plans to host Zelenskiy should he decide to come to Brussels to attend an EU summit later this week, according to reports. The Ukrainian leader is expected to address a special session of the European parliament, the Financial Times writes, adding that the proposed plan is subject to security concerns that risk derailing Zelenskiy’s trip. -----------------------------9Germany’s plan to quickly assemble two battalions of Leopard 2 tanks from European allies and send them to Ukraine is progressing slower than expected. Several states have yet to decide whether they can spare vehicles from their own stocks. In Europe, other than Berlin, only Poland and Portugal have so far made concrete promises to contribute Leopard 2 tanks. Ukrainian soldiers are supposed to start being trained on Leopard 2 tanks in Germany and Poland from this week. “Germany’s commitment stands,” the government spokesperson Wolfgang Büchner said on Monday. -----------------------------10Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, has proposed his country should provide 75bn Norwegian kroner (£6.1bn) in aid to Ukraine over five years. Half of the aid in 2023 will fund Kyiv’s military requirements while the rest will go to humanitarian needs, although this split could change in the coming years, he said. The announcement comes after Støre’s government came under pressure to increase support for Ukraine, after earning billions in extra oil and gas revenue from Russia’s war. -----------------------------11The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, will not be meeting Vladimir Putin during his visit to Moscow this week, the Kremlin has said. Grossi is expected to meet officials from the Russian state nuclear energy firm Rosatom and the foreign ministry, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, adding that Moscow expected a “substantive dialogue”. -----------------------------12Russia’s oil and gas revenues plunged 46% in January, compared with the same month in 2022, under the impact of the price cap on oil exports imposed by western allies in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s finance ministry said budget revenue in January was 35% lower compared with the same month in 2022, the last month before Russia sent troops into Ukraine. -----------------------------13Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill, a close ally of Putin, worked for Soviet intelligence while living in Switzerland in the 1970s, Swiss newspapers have reported, citing declassified archives. Under the codename “Mikhailov” and officially in Geneva as a representative of the Russian Orthodox church at the World Council of Churches (WCC), Kirill’s mission was to influence the council and push it to denounce the US and its allies, the papers reported. -----------------------------14Iran and Russia are looking to build a factory in Russia that could supply more than 6,000 Iranian-designed drones for the war in Ukraine, according to reports. The Wall Street Journal claimed that the two governments are moving ahead with plans, and that an Iranian delegation went to Russia in January to visit the planned site. -----------------------------15Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov arrived in Iraq on Sunday for talks on energy and food security in view of the Ukraine conflict, an Iraqi foreign ministry spokesperson said. Lavrov will also visit Mali this week, in a trip that the west African country’s government says will strengthen defence and security ties. It will be the first time a Russian foreign minister has visited Mali, and is part of a push by Moscow to extend its influence over countries in Africa. -----------------------------16The EU-imposed ban on Russian seaborne oil products will come into force on Monday. The 27-nation bloc is banning Russian refined oil products such as diesel fuel and joining the US and other allies in imposing a price cap on sales to non-western countries. A ban on Russian seaborne crude came into force on 5 December and the extension to oil products will mean that 70% of Russian energy exports will now be subject to sanction. Oil products represent a third of Russian oil exports. -----------------------------17",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-348-of-the-invasion,
Russia-Ukraine war live: Ukraine ‘expects possible major Russian offensive this month’ – as it happened,"Oleksii Reznikov insists Kyiv has the ability to hold back Russian forces if new push comes for anniversary of start of invasion. Here are the main details from the news conference held by Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, as reported by Reuters: -----------------------------1Ukraine expects a possible major Russian offensive this month, but Kyiv has the reserves to hold back Moscow’s forces even though the latest western military supplies will not all arrive in time. -----------------------------2Russia could launch the new attack for “symbolic” reasons around the first anniversary of its invasion, but its resources were not ready from a military point of view, Reznikov said. -----------------------------3“Despite everything, we expect a possible Russian offensive in February. This is only from the point of view of symbolism; it’s not logical from a military view. Because not all of their resources are ready. But they’re doing it anyway,” he said. -----------------------------4Russian forces have been making incremental advances in the east as Moscow tries to capture the embattled city of Bakhmut and revive its faltering invasion after a string of battlefield setbacks in the second half of last year. -----------------------------5Reznikov said the offensive would probably be launched in the east – where Russia is trying to capture all of the heavily industrialised Donbas region – or the south where it wants to widen its land corridor to the occupied peninsula of Crimea. -----------------------------6He estimated that Russia had 12,000 troops in Belarusian military bases, a number that would not be enough to launch a significant attack from Belarus into Ukraine’s north, reopening a new front. -----------------------------7The United States and other western governments have pledged billions of dollars in new military assistance including tanks and infantry fighting vehicles to help Ukraine withstand a new attack as well as to help Kyiv launch a counteroffensive. -----------------------------8“Not all of the western weaponry will arrive in time. But we are ready. We have created our resources and reserves, which we are able to deploy and with which we are able to hold back the attack,” Reznikov said -----------------------------9That’s all for this evening, thanks for following along, we are now closing the blog for today. -----------------------------10You can view all of our latest coverage of the war in Ukraine here. -----------------------------11Iran and Russia are looking to build a factory in Russia that could supply more than 6,000 Iranian-designed drones for the war in Ukraine, according to reports. -----------------------------12The Wall Street Journal says the two governments are moving ahead with plans, and that an Iranian delegation went to Russia in January to visit the planned site. -----------------------------13There has been controversy over Iran supplying drones, which have wreaked havoc on Ukrainian civilian areas and infrastructure since the war began. -----------------------------14Iran initially said it had supplied drones to Russia but that they were sent before the war broke out. However, evidence from Ukraine suggested that more and more have been supplied as the conflict continues. -----------------------------15The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, will visit Mali this week, in a trip that the west African country’s government says will strengthen defence and security ties. -----------------------------16It will be the first time a Russian foreign minister has visited Mali, and is part of a push by Moscow to extend its influence over countries in Africa. The continent has remained divided in UN votes over the invasion of Ukraine, with Mali abstaining on a vote in October to condemn Russia. -----------------------------17There have been reports that mercenaries from the Wagner group, which is linked to the Russian state, were in Mali last year and that they allegedly took part in a massacre during an offensive against militants linked to al-Qaida and Islamic State. UN experts have called for an independent investigation into war crimes by the Malian government and Wagner forces. -----------------------------18Mali’s growing friendliness with Russia has also coincided with a breakdown in relations with France, the country’s former colonial power, Reuters reports. Last year, the rift led Paris to withdraw all its troops, who had been battling militants since 2013. -----------------------------19“This high-level visit is in line with the political choice made by the transitional government to expand and diversify strategic partnerships,” the Malian government said. -----------------------------20Today’s key developments so far: -----------------------------21Helping to arm Ukraine so it can defend itself against Russia is the swiftest path to achieving peace, the British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said, writing in in the Times of Malta before a visit on Tuesday to the Mediterranean island. -----------------------------22Ukraine will not use longer-range weapons pledged by the United States to hit Russian territory and will only target Russian units in occupied Ukrainian territory, defence minister Oleksii Reznikov said. -----------------------------23Ukraine expects a possible major Russian offensive this month, but Kyiv has the reserves to hold back Moscow’s forces even though not all the west’s latest military supplies will have arrived in time, said Reznikov. -----------------------------24The German prosecutor general, Peter Frank, told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper his office had collected “hundreds” of pieces of evidence showing war crimes by Russian forces in Ukraine. -----------------------------25The former Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett said that Vladimir Putin made him a promise he would not try to kill Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during a trip to Moscow shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine last year. -----------------------------26The head of Russia’s private Wagner militia said fierce fighting was continuing in the northern parts of the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, which has been the focus of Russian forces’ attention for weeks. Yevgeniy Prigozhin, rejected reports in Russian media that Ukrainian troops were abandoning Bakhmut, saying: “Fierce battles are going on in the northern quarters for every street, every house, every stairwell.” -----------------------------27The situation on the frontlines in the east of the country was getting tougher and Russia was throwing more and more troops into battle, President Zelenskiy, said on Saturday. -----------------------------28The embattled eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut has become “increasingly isolated”, according to the latest assessment by the UK Ministry of Defence. “Over the last week, Russia has continued to make small advances in its attempt to encircle the Donbas town of Bakhmut,” the MoD tweeted on Sunday. -----------------------------29Ukrainian forces remain in control of the village of Bilohorivka, the Luhansk region governor, Serhiy Haidai, has said, adding that the situation there is tense, but under control. -----------------------------30Zelenskiy has revoked the citizenship of several former influential politicians. He would not list the names but said they had dual Russian citizenship. -----------------------------31The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said Vladimir Putin “has not made any threats against me or Germany” in his telephone conversations with the Russian president, Bild am Sonntag reported. The former British prime minister Boris Johnson, speaking to the BBC for a documentary last week, said the Russian leader had threatened him with a missile strike that would “only take a minute”. The Kremlin said Johnson was lying. -----------------------------32Price caps on Russian oil probably hit Moscow’s revenues from oil and gas exports by nearly 30% in January, or about $8bn, compared with a year before, the International Energy Agency (IEA) chief, Fatih Birol, said on Sunday. -----------------------------33The European Union is taking another big step toward cutting its energy ties with Russia. The 27-nation bloc is banning Russian refined oil products such as diesel fuel and joining the US and other allies in imposing a price cap on sales to non-western countries. The ban takes effect from Sunday. -----------------------------34More on Russia’s defence ministry accusing Ukraine of preparing to blow up buildings in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk and then accuse Moscow of carrying out war crimes and targeting civilians in a false flag operation. -----------------------------35On Sunday, Russia’s defence ministry said Kyiv planned to detonate three medical buildings – dispensaries and a hospital – and “accuse Russia of an allegedly ‘deliberate attack’ on civilian objects”, Reuters reports. . -----------------------------36“The bombing of the medical institutions will be presented as another ‘atrocity’ of Russian troops, requiring a response from the world community and accelerating the supply of long-range missiles to Kyiv [to be used] for strikes on Russian territory,” the defence ministry said. -----------------------------37Reuters reports that the defence ministry provided no evidence for the claims it outlined in a post shared on social media. -----------------------------38There was no immediate response from Kyiv to the claims. -----------------------------39My Guardian colleague Dan Sabbagh has tweeted: -----------------------------40Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine's defence minister, gave an hour plus long press conference in Kyiv going over his tenure in war time.

The defence ministry provided no evidence for the claims, which it outlined in a post shared on social media on Sunday, Reuters reports. -----------------------------53Ukraine’s defence minister Oleksii Reznikov has addressed speculation over his future, saying he he was ready to step down if President Zelenskiy ordered his dismissal. -----------------------------54“No official is in the chair forever. Not one,” Reznikov said at a news conference, the Kyiv Independent reports. “I will do what the head of state suggests to me.” -----------------------------55The statement comes after Ukrainian news outlet Ukrainska Pravda cited government and military sources saying that Reznikov was likely to be dismissed from his ministerial post next week, and could be appointed justice minister. -----------------------------56According to the publication, the likely replacement for him is Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence. -----------------------------57Ukraine expects a possible major Russian offensive this month, but Kyiv has the reserves to hold back Moscow’s forces even though not all the west’s latest military supplies will have arrived in time, Ukraine’s defence minister said on Sunday. -----------------------------58At a news conference, Oleksii Reznikov, the official, said Russia could launch the new attack in February for symbolic reasons around the first anniversary of its invasion, but that Moscow’s resources were not ready from a military point of view, Reuters reports. -----------------------------59Ukraine will not use longer-range weapons pledged by the US to hit Russian territory and will only target Russian units in occupied Ukrainian territory, the defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said on Sunday. -----------------------------60The US confirmed on Friday that a new rocket that would double Ukraine’s strike range was included in a £1.8bn US military aid package to help Kyiv fight back Russian forces, Reuters reports. -----------------------------61“We always tell our partners officially that we will not use weapons supplied by foreign partners to fire on Russian territory. We only fire on Russian units on temporarily occupied Ukrainian territory,” Reznikov told reporters at a news conference. -----------------------------62Germany’s prosecutor general said on Sunday that his office had collected “hundreds” of pieces of evidence showing war crimes by Russian forces in Ukraine, calling for an international effort to bring leaders to justice. -----------------------------63“At the moment we are focusing on mass killings in Bucha and attacks on Ukraine’s civil infrastructure,” prosecutor Peter Frank told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper. -----------------------------64AFP reports: -----------------------------65He said most of the evidence came from interviews with Ukrainian refugees, and the goal was now to “prepare for a possible later court case – whether in Germany or with our foreign partners or an international court”. -----------------------------66Frank’s office has previously used the principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows the prosecution of certain grave crimes regardless of where they took place, to try Syrians over atrocities committed during the country’s civil war. Under the same principle, a group of people from Myanmar last month filed a criminal complaint in Germany, accusing their country’s military of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Frank said his office had begun its Ukraine inquiry in March 2022 -----------------------------67“We are not targeting certain specific people in the investigation but rather are collecting information and evidence,” he said. He acknowledged, however, that prosecution of suspected war criminals in Germany was possible only if they were in the country. German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock last month called for a tribunal to get around the fact that the international criminal court (ICC), despite launching it own investigation last year, cannot prosecute Russia for any possible war crimes since neither Russia nor Ukraine are members of the Hague-based court. -----------------------------68More on our earlier post on former Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett’s claim Putin promised he would not try to kill President Zelenskiy. -----------------------------69Bethan McKernan in Jerusalem reports: -----------------------------70The former Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett has said in an interview that Vladimir Putin made him a promise he would not try to kill Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during a trip to Moscow shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine last year. -----------------------------71Speaking on a podcast with the Israeli journalist Hanoch Daum, published on Sunday, Bennett said he received assurance from Putin that the Ukrainian president’s life would be safe during a secretive visit to the Russian capital last March aimed at mediation during the war’s early days. -----------------------------72“I asked: ‘Are you planning to kill Zelenskiy?’ He said: ‘I won’t kill Zelenskiy.’ I then said to him: ‘I have to understand that you’re giving me your word that you won’t kill Zelenskiy.’ He said: ‘I’m not going to kill Zelenskiy.’” -----------------------------73Bennett said he then called Zelenskiy on his way to Moscow’s airport, who asked: “‘Are you sure?’ and I told him: ‘Yes, 100%, he won’t kill you.’” -----------------------------74The biggest test of the west’s ability to do harm to the Russian economy comes into force on Monday when the EU imposes a ban on Russian seaborne oil products such as diesel and tries to impose a G7-approved price cap on the same products across the rest of the world. -----------------------------75A ban on Russian seaborne crude came into force on 5 December and this extension to oil products will mean that 70% of Russian energy exports will now be subject to sanction. Oil products represent a third of Russian oil exports, with western Europe importing 600,000 barrels of diesel a month. The G7 set a price cap of $100 per barrel for high-value exports such as diesel and gasoline used for transport and electricity and a lower cap of $45 a barrel for fuel oils -----------------------------76Oil and gas exports formed about 70% of the foreign currency income for the Russian state. -----------------------------77The two bans were agreed by the EU back on 3 June, but only on the basis that the bans came into force months later, giving western economies time to wean off Russian energy. -----------------------------78The Druzhba pipeline providing supplies to the Czech Republic and the majority of Slovakia and Hungary has been exempted. -----------------------------79Oil experts are increasingly at odds about whether the oil sanctions have the potential to achieve their main purpose, which is to reduce income going into the Russian Treasury, so creating deficits that the Russian central bank will find harder to finance as the year goes on. -----------------------------80Critics say the $60 a barrel price caps set for crude oil and oil products are too high since they are both set above the current market rate. -----------------------------81Its defenders say the cap levels maintain stability in the markets and allow alternative purchasers of crude – mainly India and China – to buy at discounted rates, so reducing income to the Russian government. -----------------------------82The UK Treasury said in a weekend statement that Putin’s flagship crude oil Urals has since November been selling around $40 lower than Brent, the global benchmarks. -----------------------------83The price cap is enforced by shippers and traders being denied insurance unless they can attest the oil is being bought below the $60 cap. The UK as the chief supplier of shipping insurance plays a critical role in this. Sixty per cent of the global cover provided by the main shipping insurance club is written in the UK. -----------------------------84The Kyiv School of Economics in a weekend report predicted a decisive turning point was being reached on sanctions as the pressure was applied to Russian oil exports. It predicts Russian real GDP will contract by 6.1% this year. Importantly, the immediate crisis will be followed by an extended period of stagnation. Altogether, we believe that Russia’s economy will be more than 15% smaller in 2024 compared with a no-war/no-sanctions scenario. -----------------------------85Janis Kluge, a member of the working party on sanctions advising the Ukrainian government, claimed Russian oil and gas revenues had dwindled to just 425.5 bn roubles in January 2023. This is about half of the revenue in January 2022. Meanwhile, global oil prices were roughly the same a year ago. -----------------------------86",https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/feb/05/russia-ukraine-war-situation-in-the-east-very-difficult-ukraines-president-says,
Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 350 of the invasion,"Ukraine claims last 24 hours deadliest of war for Russian troops; Zelenskiy warns ‘rumours’ undermine unity as new ministers take office. Ukraine’s military claimed on Tuesday that the last 24 hours were the deadliest of the war for Russian troops. It increased its tally of Russian military dead by 1,030 overnight to 133,190, the biggest increase in daily Russian military deaths since the war began in February 2022. Russia has also said it killed large numbers of Ukrainian troops in recent weeks, claiming it inflicted 6,500 Ukrainian casualties in the month of January. These figures could not be independently verified, but the assertion that the fighting was the deadliest so far fits descriptions from both sides of an escalating campaign of close-contact trench warfare in Ukraine’s east. Ukraine’s parliament has approved the appointment of Ihor Klymenko as the new interior affairs minister and Vasily Malyuk as the new head of the security services, known as the SBU. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy thanked parliament for approving his proposed candidates and called for an end to “rumours or any other pseudo-information” that could undermine unity. Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands have announced they plan to provide Ukraine with at least 100 refurbished Leopard 1 battle tanks. In a joint statement, their defence ministers said the shipment of the older Leopard 1 was part of an effort “to support Ukraine in their endeavour to withstand Russian aggression”. The delivery would occur “within the coming months” and include logistical support and training. Germany’s defence ministry has said Leopard 2A6 battle tanks will be available to Ukraine by the end of March. The head of the German arms maker Rheinmetall has also said it expects to send 20 to 25 Leopard 1 tanks to Ukraine this year. Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Tuesday. Ukraine’s top national security official, Oleksiy Danilov, has said he is confident his country will eventually receive US-made F-16 fighter jets. It was “only a matter of time” before Kyiv gets the F-16s, Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, told CNN. He also suggested Ukraine may be capable of striking Russia on its own territory, beyond occupied Ukraine. Ukraine has released extraordinary video footage that appears to show Russian fighters dragging their badly wounded commander away from the battlefield, then beating him violently with what appear to be shovels. A Ukrainian drone captured the incident near the eastern city of Bakhmut, where intense fighting has been raging for months. Russia almost certainly lacks the munitions and units required for successful offensives, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. Its intelligence update stated it remained unlikely that Russia could build up the forces needed to substantially affect the outcome of the war in the coming weeks. Recriminations have broken out among EU officials after a possible visit to Brussels by Zelenskiy was leaked, raising concerns over his security. Zelenskiy was reported to be planning a trip to Brussels this Thursday to meet EU leaders in person at a summit and address the European parliament in an extraordinary session. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has warned that western arms supplies to Ukraine are effectively “dragging” Nato into the conflict, which could lead to an “unpredictable level of escalation”. In remarks during a conference call with military officials, quoted by state-owned Tass news agency, Shoigu accused the US and its allies of “trying to prolong the conflict as much as possible” by supplying Kyiv with what he described as “heavy offensive weapons”.

All charges against the player, including attempted rape, have been dropped. The CPS said it was due to “the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material that came to light”.  But his career at Manchester United – where he earns close to £100,000 a week – still hangs in the balance.  Police yesterday announced that the charges – attempted rape, controlling and coercive behaviour and assault – had been dropped. All the allegations concerned the same young woman. The CPS said: “A combination of the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material that came to light meant there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. In these circumstances, we are under a duty to stop the case.   “We have explained our decision to all parties. We would always encourage any potential victims to come forward and report to police, and we will prosecute wherever our legal test is met.” Greenwood, 21, said: “I am relieved this matter is now over. I would like to thank my family, loved ones and friends for their support.” United said that after learning of the CPS decision the club “will now conduct its own process before determining next steps”. Bradford-born Greenwood has been suspended on full pay by the club since his arrest in January last year. He was questioned by police after disturbing images and audio clips were posted on social media. He was charged in October.  A provisional trial date was set for November this year.  Chief Supt Michaela Kerr, at Greater Manchester police, said: “The investigation team…understand the rationale for the discontinuation of proceedings, and that this decision has not been taken lightly.  ""I would like to reiterate GMP’s commitment to investigating allegations of violence against women and girls. If you feel you are a victim, please don’t let this case put you off asking for help.”  Commenting on the justice system, Farah Nazeer, of Women’s Aid, which campaigns to end domestic abuse, said yesterday: “Only one in five women report domestic abuse to police, highlighting the severe lack of trust they have that they will be taken seriously. “We’ll continue to push for evidence-led prosecutions which reduce the need to rely on the victim’s testimony. “This is crucial because of the high number of domestic abuse cases that are dropped [as] the victim no longer feels able to support a prosecution, often due to the severe barriers and safety implications of taking an abuser to court.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/mason-greenwood-attempted-rape-charges-29120382,
Prosecutors drop attempted rape case against Mason Greenwood,"Manchester United footballer, 21, was charged with attempted rape offence last year. The Manchester United footballer Mason Greenwood is no longer facing criminal proceedings over attempted rape after prosecutors dropped the case against him. -----------------------------1The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said there was “no longer a realistic prospect of conviction” after key witnesses withdrew their cooperation from the investigation. -----------------------------2Greenwood, 21, was arrested and later charged with attempted rape after an investigation launched in January 2022. The striker, who has played once for England, denied the charges and had been preparing to go on trial later this year until the CPS dropped the case on Thursday. -----------------------------3In a short statement released on his behalf, Greenwood said: “I am relieved that this matter is now over and I would like to thank my family, loved ones and friends for their support. There will be no further comment at this time.” -----------------------------4A CPS spokesperson said: “We have a duty to keep cases under continuous review. In this case, a combination of the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material that came to light meant there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. In these circumstances, we are under a duty to stop the case. -----------------------------5“We have explained our decision to all parties. We would always encourage any potential victims to come forward and report to police and we will prosecute wherever our legal test is met.” -----------------------------6Greenwood had been due to stand trial in November this year after being charged with attempted rape, assault and “repeatedly engaging” in coercive and controlling behaviour. -----------------------------7He was accused of attempting to rape the complainant in October 2021 – a charge he denied – and of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in December that year. -----------------------------8The footballer was also charged with monitoring the complainant’s social media accounts and “making threats and derogatory comments towards her, amounting to a serious effect upon her,” a court was told last year. -----------------------------9It can now be reported, however, that key witnesses withdrew cooperation from the police investigation in April 2022. -----------------------------10A court heard last October how a central plank in the inquiry had collapsed only four months after Greenwood was arrested. -----------------------------11It is understood that police and prosecutors initially decided to continue with the case because of the significant level of public interest, given Greenwood’s high profile and the seriousness of the allegations. -----------------------------12But a review of the case by CPS lawyers has concluded that there was no realistic prospect of conviction given the collapse of the case. -----------------------------13Greenwood, one of the most promising English strikers of his generation, is not expected to return immediately to the Manchester United fold until an internal investigation is concluded. -----------------------------14It is understood that the internal probe will look in detail at the allegations made against the forward and the decision by the CPS to drop the case. -----------------------------15Ch Supt Michaela Kerr, Greater Manchester police’s head of public protection, said: “Given the significant media coverage of this case, it is only fair that we share the news that the 21-year-old man who had been arrested and charged in connection with an investigation opened in January 2022 no longer faces criminal proceedings in relation to this. -----------------------------16“The investigation team has remained in regular contact with the legal team, providing any updates of note, and so understand the rationale for the discontinuation of proceedings at this stage, and that this decision has not been taken lightly.” -----------------------------17She added: “I would, however, like to use this opportunity to reiterate GMP’s commitment to investigating allegations of violence against women and girls, and supporting those affected, regardless of their circumstances, throughout what can be a hard and upsetting time for them. An ever-increasing number of officers are receiving specialist training and the force is more consistently utilising tools, available via the criminal justice system, to keep people safe and to care for victims. -----------------------------18“If you feel you are or might be a victim, please don’t let this case put you off asking for help.” -----------------------------19Manchester United said it “notes the decision” of the CPS and that it would “conduct its own process before determining next steps”. It added: “We will not make any further comment until that process is complete.” -----------------------------20In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support for rape and sexual abuse on 0808 802 9999 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 in Scotland, or 0800 0246 991 in Northern Ireland.

'Parents support teachers strikes as kids deserve to be taught by people who feel valued',"Mirror columnist Eva Simpson on the teacher strikes, and that while they may be a pain for working parents organising childcare, they are a necessary one in order for these valued people to be adequately rewarded for the challenging job they performMy heart sank when I received the dreaded email from my son’s ­primary school informing parents it would be shut today because of the teachers’ strike. Children would, they said, be sent homework to do at home. Oh gosh, it was a return to the pain of homeschooling without PE from Joe Wicks to put a smile on our faces. The parents WhatsApp group – usually reserved for messages about missing jumpers and the weekly spelling list – sprang into life.  Parents who couldn’t work from home were panicking about childcare, those of us who could work from home worried about how we’d even be able to get any work done, and how we’d feed our kids’ insatiable demand for snacks.  But despite the major inconvenience, pretty much all of the parents were on the side of the teachers. Because as challenging as it is when schools are closed, we all appreciate the great work they do in classrooms across the country. Day one of lockdown had me calling for teachers to be paid more when I realised how much they had to contend with during the day. Teaching is a passion for many who do it for the love of the job, but that doesn’t mean they should be paid any less.  Yesterday was the first of seven strikes expected to go ahead in England and Wales affecting 23,400 schools. Around 85% of schools were due to be fully or partially closed. Educators joined thousands of other workers on the biggest walkout in a decade with up to 500,000 downing tools.  The decision to go on strike won’t have been taken lightly. Talks stalled on Monday with teachers who have been offered a 5% pay rise which works out as a 5% pay cut due to inflation. Children deserve to be taught by people who feel valued and motivated, not fed up, ground down and struggling to make ends meet. For their sake, all sides need to get back around the negotiating table and sort this mess out. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/parents-support-teachers-strikes-kids-29109058,
‘I know how hard the work is’: parents’ views on the teachers’ strike,"Three parents share their views on the strike by tens of thousands of teachers in England and Wales. More than 100,000 teachers in England and Wales are taking part in a strike organised by the UK’s largest education union. The UK education secretary, Gillian Keegan, claimed that the majority of schools in England and Wales would remain open. The National Education Union predicted that 85% of schools would be affected, with one survey suggesting that up to one in seven schools would be closed, rising to a quarter in London. -----------------------------1Here, three parents discuss how they and their children are being affected by the strike and their views on the action. -----------------------------2“We recently moved our three-year-old daughter to a preschool in a primary school, and so we’re affected by today’s strikes. I took the day off work, and my daughter and I joined the teachers on the picket line this morning, brought them some biscuits we’d made, and had a chat. We spent the afternoon in the leisure centre for soft play and swimming. -----------------------------3“I’m in a fortunate position that my work is very flexible. [While] taking the day off work is never super easy, I’ve managed to put my phone away and it’s nice to have some more time to spend with my daughter. I appreciate that for others it’s much more complicated. -----------------------------4“I wholeheartedly support the teachers’ strikes. I’m concerned that as a country we can’t pay the people we trust daily with our children’s wellbeing and development better. I used to be a primary teacher myself, and I know how hard the work is, how long the days are, and that pay has been eroded.”Michael Watts, 39, software engineer in London -----------------------------5“Luckily enough my parents can step in today – they’re at the zoo with the kids, who are six and nine. But they’re not going to be able to step in for every one of four days – I imagine we’ll have to take some time off over coming weeks. We don’t get the holidays the teachers get, you’re limited. And who knows if there’ll be more strike days? Then you’re scrabbling around, taking unpaid leave. -----------------------------6“My patience is running out with teachers at the moment. Do they forget Covid, when we were home schooling our children while [we got] a few photocopied lesson plans sent home once a week if we were lucky? Kids missed months of education, it affected a whole generation of kids. Now they are on strike for four days and the school is closed. -----------------------------7“We all want 15% pay rises. Teachers, don’t be upset with us parents if you find there is no wine or gift vouchers at Christmas. It’s quite clear you put yourselves first and the children second.” Steve, 45, contracts manager in Merseyside -----------------------------8“My children, aged seven and 11, are in primary school and both their classes are off today. They are with their dad, who fortunately has holiday. The school didn’t mention anything about home work – we’re glad to not have to do home schooling again. -----------------------------9“I fully support the teachers. It’s ludicrous that successive governments have allowed teaching to be so devalued by failing to deliver attractive pay and benefits, [which would] ensure it’s an appealing career for promising graduates. -----------------------------10“I will say though that my husband has a lot of holiday left and we both work mainly from home, so it’s not going to cause us difficulties if the children are off for the odd day. Plus, they are both doing well at school. If I was worried about missing work, losing a day’s pay or their attainment, I might feel differently, so I have sympathy for parents in any of these positions. It is relatively easy for me to be supportive because I won’t take a personal hit.” Sarah McKenna, 41, works for a retail design consultancy in London -----------------------------11",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/feb/01/i-know-how-hard-the-work-is-parents-views-on-the-teachers-strike,

"Disruption across UK as strikes hit schools, trains, universities and border checks – as it happened","UK public warned of ‘significant disruption’ from strikes involving teachers, civil servants, Border Force staff and train drivers. Thanks for tuning into our live coverage of today’s strikes, the single biggest day of UK industrial action for more than a decade. -----------------------------1Up to half a million people participated in a coordinated strike today involving teachers, civil servants, border force staff and train drivers. Here’s a recap of the day: -----------------------------2One in eight schools and colleges in England and Wales were unaffected by today’s teachers’ strike, while 9% were closed entirely, according to a survey of head teachers carried out by the Association of School and College Leaders. -----------------------------3A majority of parents support strike action by teachers, despite the disruption it will cause them, according to a new poll by Parentkind, the membership organisation for parent-teacher associations. More than 1200 parents took part in the survey and over half (54%) said they supported strike action by National Education Union members, while only 36% opposed it. -----------------------------4At an NEU rally in Westminster, the RMT general secretary, Mick Lynch, told thousands of striking teachers outside Downing Street “we are the working class, and we are back”. He added: “We are here, we are demanding change, we refuse to be bought, and we are going to win for our people on our terms.” -----------------------------5When asked what prime minister Rishi Sunak is doing to sort out the industrial action, his official spokesman said: “We want to have further talks with the unions. Some of those discussions have been constructive. We have to balance that against the need to be fair to all taxpayers, the majority of whom don’t work for the public sector.” -----------------------------6Civil servants covering for striking Border Force staff received just two days’ training before taking up their posts, the Guardian understands. Some NCA staff in Calais say they had little official training before being put to work at passport control -----------------------------7Union leaders have given the education secretary until the end of the month to ‘change her stance’. Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretaries of the NEU, said: “Today, we put the education secretary on notice. She has until our next strike day for England, 28 February, to change her stance.” -----------------------------8Thousands of students have joined striking university staff on picket lines across the country, the University and College Union (UCU) said. Jo Grady, UCU general secretary, said: “We have been overwhelmed by the support of thousands of students who have joined us on picket lines across the country.” -----------------------------9The former shadow chancellor has said public sector pay rises can be paid for by taxing capital gains at the same level as income. John McDonnell said: “We just need a fair taxation system. The issue at the moment is that we seem to have a Government that is redistributing wealth upwards.” -----------------------------10The TUC has not ruled out taking the government to court if the minimum service levels bill is passed into law. Trades Union Congress assistant general secretary Kate Bell said the legislation is “unnecessary, unfair and almost certainly illegal”. -----------------------------11The Welsh government education minister said the blame for the strikes lies with the UK government. As the government tries to resolve the dispute, Jeremy Miles said: “there are very real constraints on the Welsh government’s budget because of the frankly disgraceful position the UK government aren’t making enough funding available across the UK for public services.” -----------------------------12A deal that would bring an end to strikes is “further away than when we started” following months of failed negotiations with the government, said the Aslef general secretary, Mick Whelan. “This isn’t a new government – the same people have been in place for 12 years,” he told PA Media. -----------------------------13Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “I think Gillian Keegan [the education secretary] is hoping our strike is ineffective and people won’t do it again.” He added: “I think she’s wrong about that. There could be further action. She needs to do a deal so that that doesn’t happen.” -----------------------------14The National Education Union stands ready to negotiate once the education secretary “gets her act together and her story straight”, said union chief Mary Bousted. “Unfortunately about 85% of schools will be impacted for a strike that didn’t need to happen if the government had been prepared to negotiate,” she said. -----------------------------15Heathrow airport said it was operating as normal with minimal queuing in immigration halls despite the strike by border force workers. “Heathrow is fully operational, passengers are flowing through the border smoothly with Border Force and the military contingency providing a good level of service for arriving passengers,” a spokesperson for the airport said. -----------------------------16Paying public sector workers is a matter of “political priority”, said the general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS), Mark Serwotka. He said the government claimed it would cost £29bn to give every public sector worker what they’ve demanded; however, its calculations are near £10bn. “And £10bn in an economy like ours can easily be found,” said Serwotka. -----------------------------17Education secretary Gillian Keegan told Sky News “our objective this year is to get rid of the problem, which is inflation.” Keegan told Times Radio she was “disappointed” that a strike by teachers in England and Wales are going ahead and said the industrial action was unnecessary as discussions with the unions were continuing. -----------------------------18Here’s a look at upcoming industrial action: -----------------------------19In what was billed as the biggest day of industrial action in a decade, workers from teachers to train drivers, civil servants to university staff went on strike on Wednesday. -----------------------------20Guardian reporters spoke to groups of workers on picket lines and at demonstrations in Bristol, Birmingham and London. -----------------------------21Read more here: -----------------------------22At a rally in Glasgow nearing lunchtime, the deputy general secretary of the Scottish TUC Dave Moxham said the British people were “seeing through” the UK government’s reasons for the bill. -----------------------------23Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland, he said the mood was “resolute, confident but also angry because it’s a really bad choice to say to people during a period when - through desperation in many cases - they’re taking in action that someone’s going to take that right away.” -----------------------------24.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}This bill goes way beyond other countries quoted by the government, it fundamentally removes the right of strike from some workers and it gives employers or even the business secretary the choice of who they decide should lose that fundamental right to strike. It’s not necessary in terms of safety, it’s highly unnecessary in terms of people’s liberty and it’s something we’ll continue to oppose. -----------------------------25Moxham said there was a “completely different atmosphere” in terms of how the Scottish government approached industrial action, amidst ongoing public sector pay disputes across the country that have most recently seen teachers on strike across 16 days of rolling strikes. -----------------------------26“We’re much closer to them in terms of our shared understanding of trade union democracy.” -----------------------------27Staff working at the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh and the Scottish government have also walked out today and the Scottish Greens and Scottish Labour will not be participating in any parliamentary business on Wednesday. -----------------------------28Just one in eight schools and colleges in England and Wales have been unaffected by today’s teachers’ strike, while 9% were closed entirely, according to a survey of head teachers carried out by the Association of School and College Leaders. -----------------------------29The survey was carried out this morning by the union and found that 13% of schools that responded were fully open as normal or had no teachers on strike. -----------------------------30Geoff Barton, the ASCL’s general secretary, said: -----------------------------31.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}The overwhelming feeling among school and college leaders and teachers today will be one of sadness that we have reached a point at which strike action has been taken as a last resort against a government that will not listen. -----------------------------32“This has clearly been a difficult day for everyone concerned, but the stark truth is that the erosion of teacher pay and conditions over the past decade, and resulting teacher shortages, mean every day in education is a difficult one. -----------------------------33“We implore the government to avert further industrial action by improving pay and conditions and addressing the teacher recruitment and retention crisis.” -----------------------------34Of 948 head teachers and principals in England and Wales, mostly in secondary schools, 97% (920) reported that teachers were on strike. In 35% (330) more than half of teachers took part in the industrial action. -----------------------------35Of the 920 schools and sixth-form colleges where teachers were on strike: -----------------------------3611% (97) were fully open with all students on-site -----------------------------3780% (738) were partially open with some students on-site -----------------------------389% (85) were completely shut with no students on site. -----------------------------39Those that were partially open or completely shut took a range of measures to support students, depending on how the circumstances of the strike affected their setting. -----------------------------40Of these 823 respondents: -----------------------------4186% (709) provided work for students to do at home -----------------------------4281% (668) had on-site provisions for vulnerable students -----------------------------4335% (284) made phone calls to vulnerable students who were not on-site -----------------------------4438% (315) had on-site provisions for children of critical workers -----------------------------4560% (496) had on-site provisions for exam year groups -----------------------------4617% (136) had on-site provisions for students eligible for free school meals, with others providing measures such as packed lunches and vouchers -----------------------------47More than 100,000 teachers took to the streets, demanding a pay rise above inflation, funded by the government, rather than from existing school budgets. -----------------------------48The value of teachers’ salaries has fallen significantly in recent years, contributing to a recruitment crisis in schools. Further strikes are expected from the public sector as pressure mounts on the government to increase salaries. -----------------------------49A majority of parents support strike action by teachers, despite the disruption it will cause them, according to a new poll by Parentkind, the membership organisation for parent-teacher associations. -----------------------------50More than 1200 parents took part in the survey and over half (54%) said they supported strike action by National Education Union members, while only 36% opposed it, and almost two thirds (63%) agreed teachers should receive a pay settlement in line with current inflation. -----------------------------51Parentkind’s CEO, Jason Elsom, said: -----------------------------52.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}With strike action taking place today across England and Wales, parents will be managing with a varied picture of partial or total school closures. What our polling has shown however, is that despite the inconvenience caused by industrial action, the majority of parents clearly support the action being taken by teachers. -----------------------------53“Nobody wants schools to be closed and nobody wants children to lose days of learning, and so it’s in this vein that parents across the country want the government and the teaching unions to work together to achieve a fair and lasting settlement to the question of teacher pay. Only then can disruption to children’s education be kept to a minimum.” -----------------------------54Speaking at an NEU rally in Westminster, the RMT general secretary, Mick Lynch, told thousands of striking teachers outside Downing Street “we are the working class, and we are back”. -----------------------------55Lynch said, according to PA news: -----------------------------56.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}Welcome to Westminster, the house of fools and the house of the corrupt … Last year, Grant Shapps, remember him? He’s still around. Lurking around all of these buildings here, running the Government, telling Rishi Sunak what to do, trying to ban the working class. -----------------------------57“He was telling the media that the railway workers have got no friends, that we would be back at work, and how dare we ask for a pay rise when teachers can’t afford to live when nurses are more deserving cases, when public-sector workers can’t get a pay deal. -----------------------------58“Our message then, as it is today, is every worker needs a pay rise, every worker needs a square deal. -----------------------------59.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}And our message is sod this, we demand, and we are united. We will not be divided on the basis of who we work for. We will not be divided on the basis of our belief, or the colour of our skin, or the part of the country we are from. We are the working-class, and we are back. We are here, we are demanding change, we refuse to be bought, and we are going to win for our people on our terms.” -----------------------------60When asked what Rishi Sunak is doing to sort out the industrial action, his official spokesperson told PA news: -----------------------------61.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}We want to have further talks with the unions. Some of those discussions have been constructive. We have to balance that against the need to be fair to all taxpayers, the majority of whom don’t work for the public sector. -----------------------------62“As we’ve seen from the IMF just this week, inflation is one of the biggest risks to people’s pay packets and the government will continue to take responsible action to ensure public sector workers are paid fairly but that it’s also affordable for the taxpayer.” -----------------------------63When asked about the apparent unwillingness of the prime minister or chancellor to meet with union leaders, the official said: -----------------------------64.css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}I wouldn’t agree with that statement. I think it is true that obviously we need to consider it in the round. -----------------------------65“But equally, we think the fair thing to do is to have an independent body that considers things like inflation, and other input factors like retention and recruitment in coming to a judgment. That’s what’s happened this time round, that’s what we think should happen for the current pay review period we’re in.” -----------------------------66Exclusive: Some NCA staff in Calais say they had little official training before being put to work at passport control -----------------------------67Civil servants covering for striking Border Force staff received just two days’ training before taking up their posts, the Guardian understands. -----------------------------68During the first set of strikes in December, members of the armed services and staff from Whitehall received between five and seven days of training before being asked to check on crimes such as carrying a false passport, drug smuggling, people trafficking and modern slavery. -----------------------------69Border Force guards are usually given three weeks of training as a minimum before they interact with the public. After the three weeks, they are given a mentor to work alongside for up to a month to ensure they can work solo on a passport desk. -----------------------------70But some National Crime Agency (NCA) staff who are working in Calais received just two days of official training before being put to work at passport control. -----------------------------71One informed source said: “Staff from NCA have been brought in to cover strikers in Calais.

"Teachers, civil servants and train drivers walk out TODAY in biggest strike in a decade","Today's walkouts by five unions will be biggest day of strike action since 2011 - and will coincide with mass protests by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) against the Government's anti-strike legislationTeachers, lecturers, civil servants and train drivers will go on strike today in the largest wave of industrial action in more than a decade. Up to half a million workers will down tools across England and Wales as ministers continue to resist their demands for a decent pay rise. Today's walkouts by five unions will be biggest day of strike action since 2011 - and will coincide with mass protests by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) against the Government's anti-strike legislation Soldiers are being drafted in to cover for striking workers as around 100,000 civil servant members of the PCS union are due to walk out - threatening turmoil at airports and disruption to services including benefits, passports, and driving licences. Downing Street said around 600 military personnel would be brought in to assist but admitted there would be ""significant disruption"". Tens of thousands of schools will be affected as fed-up teachers join pickets in protest over pay and workloads, which union leaders blame for persistent staffing issues.   Members of the National Education Union (NEU), the UK's largest teaching union, are taking part in the first of seven strike dates, which is expected to affect 23,400 schools in England and Wales. Six more days of walkouts have already been announced up to March 16, and the NEU has warned they could announce more dates if ministers don't get serious on pay. Some schools have already decided to close while other heads won't know what staffing gaps they have to fill until the strike begins. The NEU balloted more than 300,000 members - and another 40,000 people have joined the union since the strikes were announced. The exact number of teachers out on strike is not known, as schools will only be affected by up to four of the seven strike dates so not all NEU members will walk out at the same time.  There were 563,831 full time teachers in the UK in the 2021/22 academic year, the latest official data shows. In echoes of Covid lockdowns, schools are being urged to prioritise vulnerable kids and the children of critical workers, and then pupils preparing for exams. The Government has told heads to keep schools open wherever possible but they can switch to online lessons if they haven't got enough staff. Teachers are furious about the Government's offer of a 5% pay rise for most teachers - which works out as a 5% cut due to inflation. Talks to avert the strikes ended without agreement on Monday. Train drivers from the Aslef and RMT unions are striking today as part of a long running pay dispute in fresh misery for rail passengers. And lecturers and other university workers in the UCU union will also be on the picket lines.  Downing Street said today's mass strike action will be ""very difficult"" for Brits. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""We know that there will be significant disruption given the scale of the strike action that is taking place tomorrow and that will be very difficult for the public trying to go about their daily lives. ""We are upfront that this will disrupt people's lives and that's why we think negotiations rather than picket lines are the right approach.""  Fewer than 1 in 5 Brits (17%) think Rishi Sunak's Government is doing a good job negotiating with trade unions to prevent strikes - and 31% think a Labour government led by Keir Starmer would do a better job.  The poll by Ipsos, published today, found 44% back striking teachers while 35% oppose the walkouts. A majority of the public also support nurses (61%) and ambulance crews (55%) on strike action. Public opinion is more split on border force staff with 37% in favour and 34% against, while 35% back rail strikes and 39% oppose them. It comes as new analysis from the TUC said the average public sector was £203 a month worse off compared to 2010 once inflation has been taken into account. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak said: “Public sector workers face a double whammy. First ministers hold down their pay and then they attack their fundamental right to strike.  “Let’s be clear. This will do nothing to solve the staffing crisis in our schools and in the NHS.   “After years of brutal pay cuts, nurses, teachers and millions of other public servants have seen their living standards decimated – and are set to face more pay misery. “Instead of scheming up new ways to attack the right to strike, ministers should get pay rising across the economy – starting with a decent pay rise for workers across the public sector.” Liberal Democrat education spokesperson Munira Wilson said school closures were the last thing parents and children need after the disruption caused by the pandemic. She said: ""It’s unacceptable that Conservative Ministers have let it come to this. They have crashed the economy and bungled the negotiations over teachers’ pay. ""Today, parents and children will yet again be forced to pay the price for this Conservative chaos."" Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said the strikes were ""hugely disappointing"" and said unions didn't need to walk out to get her attention. She said: These strikes will have a significant impact on children’s education, especially following the disruption of the past two years, and are creating huge uncertainty for parents. “With talks ongoing on a range of issues, including around future pay, workload, behaviour and recruitment and retention, it is clear that strikes are not being used as a last resort.""

Ministers and unions dig in amid widespread strike action across UK,"Little prospect of breakthrough as strikes hit schools, trains, universities and border posts. Unions and the government appear as far apart as ever after widespread strike action closed or partly closed more than half of schools across England and Wales. -----------------------------1Striking workers from participating unions held rallies in cities including Bristol, Brighton, Birmingham and London on Wednesday as teachers, university staff, rail workers and civil servants stopped work to demand better pay. -----------------------------2When Rishi Sunak was asked whether he would negotiate with public sector workers, the prime minister instead called on Labour to condemn the teachers’ strikes as “wrong”, and he told MPs that children “deserve to be in school today, being taught”. -----------------------------3A survey of 948 schools by the Association of School and College Leaders found that 920 were affected by the industrial action. In 35% of schools, more than half of teachers were on strike. -----------------------------4The Department for Education was eager to stress that 90% of state schools in England remained open, based on its figures – though less than half – 45.9% – were “fully open”. The DfE defined a school as being “fully open” if 90% of its pupils were either present, absent for unauthorised reasons or ill. -----------------------------5If more than 10% of pupils were registered as out of school for strike-related reasons, including those asked to work from home, the school was counted as “open but restricting attendance”. Only if no pupils at all were present was a school defined as closed. -----------------------------6The education secretary, Gillian Keegan, said: “One school closure is too many, and it remains deeply disappointing that the NEU proceeded with this disruptive action – but many teachers, headteachers and support staff have shown that children’s education and wellbeing must always come first.” -----------------------------7Polling by Savanta suggested 58% of parents supported the teachers’ strike, despite having to cope with school closures. Across the population as a whole, 50% backed the teachers. -----------------------------8Chris Hopkins, Savanta’s political research director, said: “The government’s strategy on the strikes has very much been to hope that the greater the disruption, the higher the opposition, but so far that hasn’t been the case.” -----------------------------9The leaders of the National Education Union (NEU), Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney, described Wednesday’s strike as “a huge statement from a determined membership who smashed through the government’s thresholds that were only ever designed to prevent strike action happening at all”. -----------------------------10They urged Keegan to “step up with concrete and meaningful proposals” in time to halt their next planned strike action, on 28 February. -----------------------------11Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS), which represents civil servants, said he was also waiting for a serious offer from ministers. “There is no substance, nothing remotely looking like it,” he said. -----------------------------12Many PCS members have been awarded a 2% pay increase, and 100,000 members across public services from museums to border posts were striking on Wednesday. -----------------------------13After visiting picket lines around London and addressing a rally, Serwotka described striking members as “very young, very vibrant, very diverse. Lots of first-time strikers, and a real sense from many of them that they felt quite empowered.” -----------------------------14Hailing continued public support for their cause, he said: “Unless anything shifts, there’s an inevitability that this is bound to grow.” -----------------------------15after newsletter promotion -----------------------------16The focus will swing back to the NHS next week with four days of industrial action, kicking off with simultaneous strikes by nurses and ambulance workers on Monday. -----------------------------17Health unions are deeply frustrated by what they see as the unwillingness of ministers to enter into serious discussions. -----------------------------18A government source sought to blame the unions for the standoff, saying “they need to come to the table with something that is realistic”, and insisting ministers and officials were ready to talk. -----------------------------19But the health unions say it is the government that needs to make a fresh offer – specifically, on pay – and that no meetings are scheduled. -----------------------------20Sunak struck a tough line on the school strikes at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday. “When it comes to teachers, we’ve actually given teachers the highest pay rise in 30 years, that includes a 9% pay rise for newly qualified teachers and record investment in their training and development,” he said. “I am clear that our children’s education is precious, and they deserve to be in school today being taught.” -----------------------------21Responding to a question from the City of Durham MP, Mary Kelly Foy, he said Labour “would do well to say that the strikes are wrong and we should be backing our schoolchildren”. -----------------------------22The RMT and Aslef rail unions held the first of two days of strike action on Wednesday, causing widespread disruption to train travel. The RMT general secretary, Mick Lynch, told a rally in London: “We are the working class, and we are back. We are here, we are demanding change, we refuse to be bought, and we are going to win for our people on our terms.” -----------------------------23The RMT said on Wednesday that it had received a new pay offer from Network Rail, which its national executive committee would now consider. “No decision has been made on the proposals nor any of the elements within them,” the union said. -----------------------------24The dispute with Network Rail is separate from the long-running standoff with train operating companies. -----------------------------25Downing Street’s public stance remained unchanged by Wednesday’s strikes, with Sunak’s official spokesperson offering no new initiatives to unblock a process that some in Westminster fear is at an impasse. -----------------------------26“We want to have further talks with the unions,” the spokesperson said. “Some of these discussions have been constructive. We have to balance that against the need to be fair to all taxpayers, the majority of whom don’t work for the public sector.” -----------------------------27",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/01/ministers-and-unions-dig-in-amid-widespread-strike-action-across-uk,

Half term holidays at risk as Border Force announce four days of strike action,"One thousand Border Force officers will stage strikes for four days during half term - putting school holidays in jeopardy - the Public and Commercial Services union has announcedOne thousand Border Force officers will stage strikes for four days during half term - putting school holidays in jeopardy. Staff working in Dover, Calais, Coquelles and Dunkirk are to walk out on February 17-20, the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union has announced. More than 100,000 civil servants who are members of the PCS union are to strike tomorrow. Border Force staff are affected by similar issues over pay, pensions, redundancy terms and job security. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: “Our members perform vital roles. We therefore expect our strikes tomorrow [Wednesday, February 1] will have a massive impact on public services. “And the strikes we have announced today in the Border Force will impact on people returning from their holidays during the half term period.   “For while the government brought untrained military personnel in to replace our highly-skilled and experienced officers in airports over Christmas, they won’t be able to do that in France. “The blame for these strikes lies firmly at the feet of ministers who are refusing to put any money on the table.” Strikes by up to half-a-million workers across the UK in bitter disputes over pay, jobs and conditions are set to take place this week.  Teachers, train drivers, civil servants, university lecturers, bus drivers and security guards from seven trade unions will walk out on Wednesday in what will be the biggest day of industrial action in over a decade.  Thousands of ambulance workers in Unison across five services in England will also strike on February 10 in the long-running dispute over pay and staffing, the union announced today. It puts further pressure on the Prime Minister, who is failing to get a grip on industrial action.  Unison's February 10 strike again involves ambulance workers in London, Yorkshire, the South West, North East and North West.  Unison's fresh date will mean strikes will now be happening across the NHS every day next week apart from Wednesday.  The GMB announced that more than 10,000 blue light workers in England will walk out on February 6 and 20, and March 6 and 20, in a fraught dispute over pay. The February 6 date coincides with further strike action by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England and Wales, marking the first time paramedics and nurses will down tools on the same day. Nurses will also strike the following day, along with midwives in Wales.  Follow Mirror Politics on    Snapchat   ,    Tiktok   ,    Twitter   and    Facebook.

Negotiators make breakthrough in Northern Irish protocol dispute,"Agreement on food and animal health checks ‘close to being done’, but no progress on trickier issues. EU and UK negotiators have made a breakthrough in reducing checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as part of efforts to resolve the long-running dispute over the Northern Irish protocol. -----------------------------1A senior EU official confirmed to the Guardian that an agreement on food and animal health checks was “close to being done” as part of a deal that would create red and green lanes at Northern Irish ports to differentiate between goods staying in the region and those moving south to the EU’s single market. -----------------------------2Goods from Great Britain destined to stay in Northern Ireland would go through a green lane with lighter checks, although the precise nature of customs paperwork, and food and animal health checks remains unclear. -----------------------------3The deal would require the UK to meet EU requirements to prevent food and animals for Northern Ireland slipping into the EU’s internal markets via the Irish land border. Food products would have to be labelled; UK authorities would have to undertake market surveillance to monitor and enforce food safety and animal welfare standards. -----------------------------4Last month the EU and UK struck a deal on real-time data-sharing on goods moving across the Great Britain-Northern Ireland border that is regarded as critical for any reduction in checks on Northern Ireland-only goods. -----------------------------5The latest development raises hopes of a broader agreement on the protocol, but the senior source cautioned that “nothing has happened” on other difficult issues, including the role of the European court of justice. -----------------------------6The agreement on red and green lanes and links to food and animal standards was reported on Monday by Ireland’s public broadcaster RTÉ, following earlier reports of a breakthrough on customs checks. -----------------------------7The European Commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič, who is leading talks for the commission, did not respond directly to a question about whether the EU had accepted the UK’s red and green lanes proposal, but said the two sides were working closely and constructively. -----------------------------8“Progress is being made, but difficulties remain,” he told reporters after briefing EU ministers on the protocol talks. “For us it is very clear equation: more and stronger safeguards we can get, more flexibility we can explore.” -----------------------------9Customs has long been seen as the area with the greatest potential for compromise as the UK and EU have similar ideas. In October 2020 the European Commission proposed an express lane for goods destined to stay in Northern Ireland and posing no risk of going to the EU single market. But while the commission believes it could reduce paperwork by 50%, the UK government wanted to end all checks on lorries travelling through the green lane. -----------------------------10Recalling the EU express lane proposal, Šefčovič said: “We do not insist on the precise names, we just want to make sure that the system would work.” -----------------------------11The nature of green-lane controls remains unclear and has been discussed in minute detail during negotiations, down to exactly where on packaging “Northern Ireland-only” product labels would be placed. -----------------------------12The Northern Ireland protocol was an integral part of the 2019 Brexit agreement signed between Boris Johnson and the EU. To avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, it created a border in the Irish Sea, leaving Northern Ireland following EU single market and customs rules, policed by the European court of justice. -----------------------------13About seven months after the end of the Brexit transition in 2021, Johnson demanded a full-scale renegotiation, taking EU-UK relations to an all-time low. -----------------------------14after newsletter promotion -----------------------------15Despite progress on customs and food and animal checks, EU sources stressed other issues remain unsolved, including the ECJ. “Šefčovič is ready to compromise on everything except the ECJ,” said a second senior EU source. “The ECJ is the reddest of red lines.” -----------------------------16EU officials also remain cautious or sceptical as to whether Rishi Sunak can persuade his party to back a protocol deal, notably hardline Eurosceptic backbenchers who have insisted the ECJ should be scrapped from the protocol. -----------------------------17But there have been signs of a softening from the Democratic Unionist party, which has been blocking the resumption of power-sharing in Northern Ireland over protocol issues for a year. -----------------------------18The DUP has laid down seven conditions to return to Stormont, but at the weekend its leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, was not as hardline, saying the party was seeking “replacing the democratic deficit created by the protocol” with “the restoration of democratic decision making” at the assembly, a reference to the fact that Northern Ireland must observe EU laws on trade as part of the Brexit arrangements. -----------------------------19He had met Ireland’s foreign minister, Micheál Martin, on Friday and described the talks as “useful and constructive” hinting at more wriggle room. -----------------------------20British officials last week rejected suggestions of a deal, saying significant gaps remained between the two sides.

"UK and EU reach customs deal that could end Northern Ireland logjam, says report","Customs agreement is largely based on the Government’s proposals for a red and green lanes system – green for Great Britain and red for Ireland and rest of the EUThere could be a step towards a breakthrough in the dispute over the post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol after the UK and EU reached an agreement on customs, it has been reported. According to The Times, the EU has accepted a plan that would avoid routine checks on goods going into Northern Ireland. However, a Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) source has indicated that this is not necessarily the case. The FCDO suggested the report was full of speculation, saying officials were engaged in “intensive scoping talks” with Brussels and declining to pre-empt the discussions.  The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU in 2019 as a way to unlock the logjam over securing a Brexit withdrawal agreement.  READ MORE:   Designed as a means to keep the Irish land border free-flowing, it moved regulatory and customs checks on goods to the Irish Sea, creating economic barriers on trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The Times reported that the customs deal is largely based on the Government’s proposals for a red and green lanes system – with the green lane for goods from Great Britain which are staying in the region and the red lane to check and control products going on to the Republic of Ireland and the rest of the EU. There would be a separate arrangement to negotiate on exports of meat and live animals to Northern Ireland, with the UK agreeing to maintain EU veterinary standards on goods destined for the province. It has also been claimed that Brussels has made concessions of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), a key sticking point in UK-EU talks. For the first time, it recognised the ECJ could rule on Northern Ireland issues only if a case was referred by courts there.  In response, the FCDO said: “Our priority is protecting the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and preserving political stability in Northern Ireland and the UK internal market. “Any solution on the Protocol must address the range of issues on the ground in Northern Ireland. “We are currently engaging in intensive scoping talks with the EU to find solutions to these problems.”  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ’s spokesman on Monday (January 30) also suggested no deal had been struck and that “intensive scoping” was under way.   Both sides are keen to reach an agreement to break the impasse over the contentious trading arrangements before April’s landmark 25th anniversary of Northern Ireland’s historic Good Friday peace agreement. Many unionists in Northern Ireland are strongly opposed to arrangements they claim have weakened the region’s place within the union. The devolved powersharing institutions at Stormont collapsed last year after the DUP withdrew co-operation as part of its protest against the protocol.

Costa cappuccinos deliver nearly five times as much caffeine as Starbucks ones,"Which? study reveals huge disparity in the amount of caffeine delivered by high street coffee chains. Coffee lovers looking for a strong pick-me-up should avoid Starbucks and head to Costa, after it emerged its cappuccinos deliver almost five times as much caffeine – the same as four cans of Red Bull. -----------------------------1Buyers of a Costa medium cappuccino get three shots of espresso and a table-topping 325mg of caffeine, which is around the same as four cups of tea, and way above the Starbucks equivalent containing just 66mg. -----------------------------2The study by the consumer group Which? has revealed the extraordinary disparity in the amount of caffeine delivered by high street coffee chains. It said many of us could be consuming significantly more, or less, caffeine than we thought. -----------------------------3While the three-shot Costa cappuccino was the clear choice for caffeine junkies, Greggs and Pret a Manger delivered the second- and third-highest cappuccino caffeine levels, at 197mg and 180mg respectively. In comparison, a 250ml can of Red Bull – the drink of choice to sleep-deprived teenagers – contains about 80mg of caffeine. -----------------------------4For those looking to lower their caffeine intake, however, an increasingly common stance, the study found a clear “winner” on the high street – Starbucks. It might not wake you up, but its medium cappuccino contains a relatively low 66mg of caffeine, while its espresso contained half that. -----------------------------5“I think coffee is still functionally about caffeine and I feel like for the world’s most popular psychoactive drug, most people have no idea how much they’re taking,” said James Hoffmann, coffee expert and winner of the World Barista Championship in 2007. “I’m not sure that’s a good thing for any sort of supplement that you might want to use.” -----------------------------6The Which? research found that a single espresso from Pret a Manger offered the biggest hit – 180mg of caffeine. Pret’s filter coffee also contained the most caffeine at 271mg, two-and-a-half times as much as the Starbucks version. -----------------------------7Caffè Nero had the second lowest levels of caffeine after Starbucks in both the cappuccino, (110-115mg) and espresso (45mg) categories. The US Food and Drug Administration considers 400mg a safe amount of caffeine for healthy adults to consume daily. -----------------------------8Levi Tyrell Johnson, 28, regularly buys cappuccinos from Pret because of how convenient he finds it. “I’ve got a Pret subscription, so it is ease of use for me,” he said. “There’s one everywhere. Because I drink so much coffee on the go, it’s easier to pay a flat monthly fee than grabbing one every day. -----------------------------9“I like strong coffee and this is my closest coffee shop. I probably need more caffeine, I’ve got quite a high energy job so I need to stay alert and active for as long as possible, so I don’t mind the difference.” -----------------------------10Shefalee Loth, Which? nutritionist, said: “Many of us rely on coffee to get us through the dark winter mornings, but our research shows you may be consuming significantly more, or less, caffeine than you bargained for.” -----------------------------11Loth said people who were sensitive to caffeine, or needed to avoid it for health reasons, such as being pregnant, may want to request fewer shots in the drink when ordering. -----------------------------12Zoe Parker, 27, said she was really surprised by the difference in caffeine levels between the chains. She had ordered a caramel frappe from Costa Coffee. “I’m actually shocked,” she said. “I don’t drink much caffeine in general so now I feel even more surprised because I thought one coffee would be fine. -----------------------------13“I prefer Costa to Starbucks, so I’d probably still go to a Costa over a Starbucks,” Parker added. “Because I drink coffee so rarely, I would still feel fine having a Costa coffee. If I was drinking it all the time, then it might change my mind. I might go for a Starbucks instead occasionally.” -----------------------------14after newsletter promotion -----------------------------15Laurens Dekker, 25, said he would be more thoughtful about where he bought his coffee in the future as he tried to limit his caffeine consumption. “I’ve cut down a lot to just one a day,” he said. “I used to have six to eight cups. It’s just too much. -----------------------------16“I had no idea that there was that big a difference. I thought coffee was just coffee, but maybe I’ll start thinking about it now.” -----------------------------17Hoffmann said that, regardless of the caffeine content, people tended to have a favourite and knowing the caffeine content might not change their order. -----------------------------18“If someone really enjoys Starbucks, they probably won’t enjoy Costa and probably won’t enjoy Caffè Nero, for example. You have your preference … I think coffee can be delicious and very enjoyable, even when it doesn’t have caffeine in it, but I can’t deny that we all have a kind of caffeine based relationship with it.” -----------------------------19Most of the coffees in the chains Which? looked at feature at least two shots of espresso. Which? said another factor that could affect caffeine content was the variety of coffee beans, with arabica beans containing about half the caffeine of robusta beans. -----------------------------20A Costa Coffee spokesperson said the caffeine content of its drinks was clearly displayed in its stores and on its website, and it would “encourage customers to be aware of the caffeine content”. -----------------------------21“All Costa coffees can be enjoyed with decaf coffee and we offer a wide range of non-caffeinated drinks,” they added. -----------------------------22",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/01/costa-cappuccino-nearly-five-times-caffeine-as-starbucks,
"Greggs, Costa, and Pret coffees have 'huge differences in caffeine', says Which?","Cappuccinos and espressos from major high street coffee chains have been compared to show which ones are a lot stronger than othersGreggs, Costa, Pret and other high street coffee chains offer ""huge differences"" in the amount of caffeine in each cup, leaving customers with little idea how much they are consuming, a study has found. A medium cappuccino at Costa contains a ""massive"" 325mg of caffeine - around the amount contained in four cups of tea - and is almost five times the strength of a cappuccino from Starbucks, which contains the least at 66mg, consumer watchdog Which? found. Cappuccinos from Greggs and Pret a Manger also contain significantly less caffeine than Costa, as 197mg and 180mg respectively. By comparison, a 250ml can of Red Bull contains 80mg of caffeine.   A single espresso from Pret a Manger contains 180mg of caffeine - six times as much as one from Starbucks, which had a ""meagre"" 33mg by comparison, according to the watchdog's findings. Meanwhile, Pret a Manger's filter coffee also contained the most caffeine at 271mg - two and a half times as much as the Starbucks version, which contained 102mg. Greggs was a close second to Pret for its caffeine levels, containing 225mg in a cup of filter coffee. Caffè Nero had the second lowest levels of caffeine after Starbucks in both its cappuccinos – containing between 110mg and 115mg – and its espresso, with 45mg. The variations are not only due to the number of caffeine shots used across the chains but also the type of coffee bean, of which there are two main types – Arabica and Robusta.  Arabica beans contain around half the caffeine of Robusta beans, and there are also variations in taste between the two. However, the findings show buying coffee on the high street could be potentially problematic for consumers who are sensitive to caffeine, or are pregnant.  The NHS says pregnant women should consume no more than 200mg of caffeine per day, advising that a mug of instant coffee contains 100mg and a mug of filter coffee contains 140mg.  Which? nutritionist Shefalee Loth said: ""Many of us rely on coffee to get us through the dark winter mornings, but our research shows you may be consuming significantly more, or less, caffeine than you bargained for. ""Our analysis has shown that there are big variations in caffeine content between drinks from different high-street coffee shops. ""Most of the time this shouldn't be an issue but if you drink a lot of coffee or need to limit your caffeine intake you might want to consider what you're ordering and where from.""  A Costa Coffee spokeswoman said: ""The amount of caffeine included within each coffee varies, depending on both the coffee and size of drink ordered by a customer. ""All Costa coffees can be enjoyed with decaf coffee and we offer a wide range of non-caffeinated drinks including the FuzeTea Superfuzions range. ""All caffeine information is available both in our store or via our website and we would encourage customers to be aware of the caffeine content in their favourite Costa coffee to ensure it is right for their dietary requirements or lifestyle choice.""

The supermarket is to shake up its shop management roles and shut remaining counters and hot delis, on top of other measures. The counters and hot delis will close from February 26.  Tesco said all affected workers will be offered different roles within the company. However, it did not confirm the exact number of staff who work on the hot food delis and counters. Tesco also confirmed today that it will reduce the number of lead and team managers in its larger stores. The shake-up of its management structure will impact around 1,750 workers, while 350 workers will be affected by a series of localised changes. This include the closure of eight pharmacies and reduced hours at some in-store post offices.    Tesco will also remove a number of head office roles and will close the its Maintenance National Operating Centre in Milton Keynes. Again, workers will have the option to move into other vacancies across the business, the supermarket confirmed. Tesco said it will introduce around 1,800 new shift leader roles across its stores who will lead day-to-day operations. These roles will be lower paid, but managers who take the jobs will have their pay protected for two years. Jason Tarry, Tesco UK and ROI CEO said: “These are difficult decisions to make, but they are necessary to ensure we remain focused on delivering value for our customers wherever we can, as well as ensuring our store offer reflects what our customers value the most. ""Our priority is to support those colleagues impacted and help find alternative roles within our business from the vacancies and newly created roles we have available.”  Tesco first announced changes to its counters back in 2019, and says it has been reviewing them on an ""ongoing basis"" ever since. The majority of stores do not have fresh food counters as last year Tesco closed meat, fish and deli counters in more than 300 of its stores.

The supermarket is to move more than 4,000 night workers to lower-paid daytime roles, while almost 300 roles across the company are under threat of being axed. The big four chain has proposed to move overnight restocking shifts at 184 of its smaller superstore sites over to the daytime, with staff restocking ambient products between 7pm and midnight, and frozen products between 7am and 1pm instead. The exact sites affected have not been confirmed by Asda.  This move puts around 211 night shift manager roles at risk, the supermarket said. The changes will also affect around 4,137 hourly-paid workers, who will be moved to daytime hours with less pay. Their shift patterns being moved to daytime means workers lose their night shift pay premium, of at least £2.52 per hour.   Asda has said however that the proposal ""retains the number of hours available"" for staff to work in each store. Alongside this news, Asda has also announced that it will shut seven in-store pharmacies, which employ 14 pharmacists and 48 other workers. It will also make a 22% cut to staff hours across all 23 in-store Post Office shops, and a reduction in opening hours for four sites. This would affect 23 salaried Post Office Managers and 200 hourly-paid staff. The supermarket said this decision was made due to a decline in the number of customers using this service. Ken Towle, retail director at Asda said: “The retail sector is evolving at pace and it is vital we review changing customer preferences, along with our own ways of working, to ensure we are operating as efficiently as possible, so that we can continue to invest and grow our business. ""We are now entering a period of consultation with our colleagues on these proposals. We recognise this will be a difficult time for them and will do all we can to support them through this process.”  Earlier this month, the supermarket had to defend itself over the wages it gives its staff after the GMB Union criticised it for falling even further behind its competitors on wages after Sainsbury's announced a pay boost.  The union said that Asda workers receive just £10.10 per hour, which was the lowest paid of the big four and one of the ""lowest paying retailers overall"".  However, Asda said during the last year it had provided two separate increases worth a total of 8% for hourly paid staff.

It has been singled out as the lowest payer for hourly paid staff among the big supermarket chains. -----------------------------6The group, which was bought out by the billionaire Issa brothers and the private equity firm TDR Capital for almost £7bn in 2020, is thought to be considering a merger with the siblings’ petrol forecourt empire EG Group to try to reduce its debt burden. -----------------------------7The retailer performed relatively well in the run-up to Christmas, according to the latest industry data from analysts at Kantar, which indicated sales rose by 6.4% in the 12 weeks to 25 December, a bigger increase than recorded at Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons but well behind Aldi and Lidl. -----------------------------8New own-label budget groceries and the introduction of takeaway food concessions are thought to have helped trade. -----------------------------9after newsletter promotion -----------------------------10Ken Towle, Asda’s retail director, said: “The retail sector is evolving at pace and it is vital we review changing customer preferences, along with our own ways of working, to ensure we are operating as efficiently as possible, so that we can continue to invest and grow our business. -----------------------------11“We are now entering a period of consultation with our colleagues on these proposals.

Aldi increases pay for UK warehouse workers for third time in a year,"Supermarket’s rise to £13.18 on 1 February puts its hourly minimum rate 20% ahead of January 2022.

The sports retailer said the affected brands from the group are JD, Size?, Millets, Blacks, Scotts and Millet Sport. However, even with the attack the JD group has said payment card details were ""safe"" and that it has no reason to think the hackers have accessed users' passwords. But information that could have been stolen includes addresses, phone numbers and email addresses. The group announced today that the hackers had accessed a system that contained customer data relating to some online orders placed between November 2018 and October 2020.   The JD group said the intruders could have also gained access to billing, details of orders that customers have placed, and the final four digits of their payment cards in the attack.  Neil Greenhalgh, the chief financial officer of JD group apologised for the incident and said that protecting the data for its customers was an ""absolutely priority"" for the group.

The closures, which are scheduled to take place from April to June, are down to more people banking online. It comes on top of the 43 banks NatWest already had scheduled to shut this year, including 13 that have already closed this month. If your local bank is shutting and you need face-to-face support, NatWest runs mobile branches at various locations throughout the year. These can be used for basic services, like making deposits, paying bills and withdrawing cash.   NatWest also works with other UK banks to open shared banking hubs on a set day each week, where again you can use basic services. You can find your nearest mobile branch or banking hub on the NatWest website. You can also access certain facilities at Post Office branches including cash and cheque deposits, checking your balance and withdrawing cash. A NatWest spokesperson said: “As with many industries, most of our customers are shifting to mobile and online banking, because it’s faster and easier for people to manage their financial lives.  “We understand and recognise that digital solutions aren’t right for everyone or every situation, and that when we close branches we have to make sure that no one is left behind. “We take our responsibility seriously to support the people who face challenges in moving online, so we are investing to provide them with support and alternatives that work for them.” The update from NatWest comes just days after Lloyds and Halifax announced they will shut another 40 banks this year. This is on top of the 14 that had already been earmarked for closure. TSB is shutting nine bank branches and HSBC has said it will shutter 114 banks - around a quarter of its total sites - in 2023.

This includes our network of Barclays Local sites in libraries and community centres, bank pods and mobile vans, our cashback without purchase service, Shared Banking Hubs and everyday banking at the Post Office.” Banks up and down the country have been shutting their doors due to more customers shopping online - and Barclays isn't alone in closing branches.

"Asda forcing 4,000 workers to lower paid roles with hundreds more jobs at risk","Asda has revealed a raft of changes to store operations and has confirmed that hundreds of other job roles at riskAsda has announced a huge shake-up of its business that will affect thousands of workers. The supermarket is to move more than 4,000 night workers to lower-paid daytime roles, while almost 300 roles across the company are under threat of being axed. The big four chain has proposed to move overnight restocking shifts at 184 of its smaller superstore sites over to the daytime, with staff restocking ambient products between 7pm and midnight, and frozen products between 7am and 1pm instead. The exact sites affected have not been confirmed by Asda.  This move puts around 211 night shift manager roles at risk, the supermarket said. The changes will also affect around 4,137 hourly-paid workers, who will be moved to daytime hours with less pay. Their shift patterns being moved to daytime means workers lose their night shift pay premium, of at least £2.52 per hour.   Asda has said however that the proposal ""retains the number of hours available"" for staff to work in each store. Alongside this news, Asda has also announced that it will shut seven in-store pharmacies, which employ 14 pharmacists and 48 other workers. It will also make a 22% cut to staff hours across all 23 in-store Post Office shops, and a reduction in opening hours for four sites. This would affect 23 salaried Post Office Managers and 200 hourly-paid staff. The supermarket said this decision was made due to a decline in the number of customers using this service. Ken Towle, retail director at Asda said: “The retail sector is evolving at pace and it is vital we review changing customer preferences, along with our own ways of working, to ensure we are operating as efficiently as possible, so that we can continue to invest and grow our business. ""We are now entering a period of consultation with our colleagues on these proposals. We recognise this will be a difficult time for them and will do all we can to support them through this process.”  Earlier this month, the supermarket had to defend itself over the wages it gives its staff after the GMB Union criticised it for falling even further behind its competitors on wages after Sainsbury's announced a pay boost.  The union said that Asda workers receive just £10.10 per hour, which was the lowest paid of the big four and one of the ""lowest paying retailers overall"".  However, Asda said during the last year it had provided two separate increases worth a total of 8% for hourly paid staff. Responding to the criticism, an Asda spokesperson said: ""We have increased retail colleague pay twice during the last 12 months and will confirm our new pay rates for 2023 to colleagues during Q1, following the outcome of negotiations with Usdaw where we have a pay bargaining agreement.""

"Tesco announces huge change to all supermarkets with more than 2,000 jobs at risk","Tesco did not confirm the exact amount of deli and counter staff who will be affected by the closures at the end of next monthsTesco has announced a huge series of changes across its supermarkets that will impact around 2,100 jobs. The supermarket is to shake up its shop management roles and shut remaining counters and hot delis, on top of other measures. The counters and hot delis will close from February 26.  Tesco said all affected workers will be offered different roles within the company. However, it did not confirm the exact number of staff who work on the hot food delis and counters. Tesco also confirmed today that it will reduce the number of lead and team managers in its larger stores. The shake-up of its management structure will impact around 1,750 workers, while 350 workers will be affected by a series of localised changes. This include the closure of eight pharmacies and reduced hours at some in-store post offices.    Tesco will also remove a number of head office roles and will close the its Maintenance National Operating Centre in Milton Keynes. Again, workers will have the option to move into other vacancies across the business, the supermarket confirmed. Tesco said it will introduce around 1,800 new shift leader roles across its stores who will lead day-to-day operations. These roles will be lower paid, but managers who take the jobs will have their pay protected for two years. Jason Tarry, Tesco UK and ROI CEO said: “These are difficult decisions to make, but they are necessary to ensure we remain focused on delivering value for our customers wherever we can, as well as ensuring our store offer reflects what our customers value the most. ""Our priority is to support those colleagues impacted and help find alternative roles within our business from the vacancies and newly created roles we have available.”  Tesco first announced changes to its counters back in 2019, and says it has been reviewing them on an ""ongoing basis"" ever since. The majority of stores do not have fresh food counters as last year Tesco closed meat, fish and deli counters in more than 300 of its stores.  Reports from December 2022 said the store would axe a further 279 food counters at the beginning of this year.

Aldi is increasing pay for UK warehouse workers for the third time in a year – with its hourly minimum rate now 20% above last January. -----------------------------1The German-owned discounter, which is the UK’s fourth-largest supermarket chain, said pay would rise to £13.18 on 1 February, up 4% on the current minimum of £12.66, which was introduced in September. -----------------------------2The latest increase for warehouse workers comes after Aldi upped pay for store staff last month to at least £11 an hour – also the third increase in a year. -----------------------------3The new minimum wage for warehouse workers is higher than the independently verified living wage, which was raised to at least £10.90 in September. -----------------------------4The increases come amid rising competition to hire staff amid high employment levels and soaring household costs, which have led to strikes by nurses, railway and postal workers, and many others trying to protect their standard of living. -----------------------------5Several retail chains, including Tesco and Sainsbury’s, have put up pay multiple times over the past 12 months in an effort to retain and attract staff. -----------------------------6Warehouse workers have been in particularly short supply since Brexit, which reduced access to labour from across Europe. -----------------------------7Aldi needs to attract more staff as it is opening about one new store a week and is vying with its fellow German-owned discounter Lidl to be the UK’s fastest-growing grocery chain. -----------------------------8The chain’s sales rose 27% in the three months to Christmas Day, according to the latest figures from the market research group Kantar as shoppers sought ways to limit their spending over the festive period. -----------------------------9after newsletter promotion -----------------------------10Giles Hurley, the chief executive of Aldi UK and Ireland, said: “Just as we promise our customers that we will do all we can to support them, we are equally committed to supporting our amazing Aldi colleagues – as we remain the highest-paying supermarket in the UK. -----------------------------11“This announcement recognises the hard work and contribution our colleagues make in serving communities across the country and it’s down to them that we are able to ensure our customers can access fresh affordable food, every single day.” -----------------------------12",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/18/aldi-increases-pay-for-uk-warehouse-workers-for-third-time-in-a-year,
"Tesco to make big changes to stores, affecting 2,100 jobs","Supermarket chain to reduce number of shop managers and close remaining counters and hot delis. Tesco has announced a shake-up of its shop management in large UK stores along with the closure of its remaining meat, fish and hot deli counters, affecting 2,100 jobs. -----------------------------1The UK’s biggest grocer said it had started introducing a new management structure in 350 of its smaller superstores over the past two years and was extending this structure across its larger superstores and Extra stores. -----------------------------2Tesco will cut the number of lead and team managers in large UK stores by 1,750, and introduce 1,800 new lower-paid “shift leader” roles, responsible for leading on the day-to-day operational duties on the shop floor. -----------------------------3Those affected will have the option of moving into shift leader roles, where Tesco currently has vacancies, or taking redundancy. Given the shift leader job is lower paid, staff who want to stay on at Tesco will be offered the choice of receiving a lump sum to make up for the discrepancy in salary, or can opt to receive the same pay as before for two years. -----------------------------4Most Tesco supermarkets no longer operate counters, and it will shut those offering meat and fish as well as hot delis from 26 February. -----------------------------5A further 350 roles will be affected by other changes: the closure of eight pharmacies in supermarkets; moving overnight roles to the daytime in 12 stores and reducing hours in some post offices. Some jobs will also go at Tesco’s head office in Welwyn Garden City and the group intends to shut its maintenance national operating centre in Milton Keynes. -----------------------------6Jason Tarry, the chief executive of Tesco UK and Ireland, said: “These are difficult decisions to make, but they are necessary to ensure we remain focused on delivering value for our customers wherever we can, as well as ensuring our store offer reflects what our customers value the most. Our priority is to support those colleagues impacted and help find alternative roles within our business from the vacancies and newly created roles we have available.” -----------------------------7Tesco did not pay a Christmas bonus to staff for the second year in a row and only handed out a box of Quality Street confectionery worth £5 to some staff. The company paid a 10% festive bonus in 2020 and in previous years gave out a shopping voucher. -----------------------------8after newsletter promotion -----------------------------9That was despite the chief executive, Ken Murphy, hailing “further strong growth at Christmas on top of the exceptional growth of the last few years”. The supermarket chain reported a 6.1% increase in like-for-like sales in the 19 weeks to 7 January, with revenues up 7.8% during the three-week Christmas period. Food sales climbed 12.9%. -----------------------------10Tesco stuck to previous guidance, predicting an adjusted operating profit of between £2.4bn and £2.5bn for the full year. -----------------------------11",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/31/tesco-stores-jobs-supermarket-chain-managers,
"Asda plans to cut 300 jobs and reduce pay for 4,300 staff in shake-up","Supermarket to make sweeping changes affecting night shifts, Post Office outlets and pharmacies. More than 300 jobs at Asda are at risk and 4,300 staff will receive a pay cut after the supermarket announced a swathe of changes to night shifts, Post Office outlets and pharmacies to cut costs. -----------------------------1The supermarket chain said 211 night shift manager roles were going and a further 4,137 staff would lose out on premiums of at least £2.52 an hour for working nights as it switched the restocking of packaged groceries and frozen food to daytimes and evenings. -----------------------------2In addition, Asda planned to close seven of its 254 in-store pharmacies, putting 62 jobs at risk, including 14 pharmacists. -----------------------------3Twenty-three management roles were under threat and another 200 staff would have their working hours reduced as the retailer planned a 22% reduction in colleague hours across all 23 of its in-store Post Offices, with four reducing their opening hours by about 9%. Asda said the move was down to “a decline in the number of customers using this service”. -----------------------------4The shake-up comes as the big supermarkets look for ways to cut costs amid rising inflation on food, energy and labour as well as competition from fast-expanding discounters Aldi and Lidl. -----------------------------5Asda, the UK’s third biggest supermarket, has made a number of moves to cut costs, including reducing premiums for delivery drivers in the autumn. It has been singled out as the lowest payer for hourly paid staff among the big supermarket chains. -----------------------------6The group, which was bought out by the billionaire Issa brothers and the private equity firm TDR Capital for almost £7bn in 2020, is thought to be considering a merger with the siblings’ petrol forecourt empire EG Group to try to reduce its debt burden. -----------------------------7The retailer performed relatively well in the run-up to Christmas, according to the latest industry data from analysts at Kantar, which indicated sales rose by 6.4% in the 12 weeks to 25 December, a bigger increase than recorded at Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons but well behind Aldi and Lidl. -----------------------------8New own-label budget groceries and the introduction of takeaway food concessions are thought to have helped trade. -----------------------------9after newsletter promotion -----------------------------10Ken Towle, Asda’s retail director, said: “The retail sector is evolving at pace and it is vital we review changing customer preferences, along with our own ways of working, to ensure we are operating as efficiently as possible, so that we can continue to invest and grow our business. -----------------------------11“We are now entering a period of consultation with our colleagues on these proposals.

"Asda forcing 4,000 workers to lower paid roles with hundreds more jobs at risk","Asda has revealed a raft of changes to store operations and has confirmed that hundreds of other job roles at riskAsda has announced a huge shake-up of its business that will affect thousands of workers. The supermarket is to move more than 4,000 night workers to lower-paid daytime roles, while almost 300 roles across the company are under threat of being axed. The big four chain has proposed to move overnight restocking shifts at 184 of its smaller superstore sites over to the daytime, with staff restocking ambient products between 7pm and midnight, and frozen products between 7am and 1pm instead. The exact sites affected have not been confirmed by Asda.  This move puts around 211 night shift manager roles at risk, the supermarket said. The changes will also affect around 4,137 hourly-paid workers, who will be moved to daytime hours with less pay. Their shift patterns being moved to daytime means workers lose their night shift pay premium, of at least £2.52 per hour.   Asda has said however that the proposal ""retains the number of hours available"" for staff to work in each store. Alongside this news, Asda has also announced that it will shut seven in-store pharmacies, which employ 14 pharmacists and 48 other workers. It will also make a 22% cut to staff hours across all 23 in-store Post Office shops, and a reduction in opening hours for four sites. This would affect 23 salaried Post Office Managers and 200 hourly-paid staff. The supermarket said this decision was made due to a decline in the number of customers using this service. Ken Towle, retail director at Asda said: “The retail sector is evolving at pace and it is vital we review changing customer preferences, along with our own ways of working, to ensure we are operating as efficiently as possible, so that we can continue to invest and grow our business. ""We are now entering a period of consultation with our colleagues on these proposals. We recognise this will be a difficult time for them and will do all we can to support them through this process.”  Earlier this month, the supermarket had to defend itself over the wages it gives its staff after the GMB Union criticised it for falling even further behind its competitors on wages after Sainsbury's announced a pay boost.  The union said that Asda workers receive just £10.10 per hour, which was the lowest paid of the big four and one of the ""lowest paying retailers overall"".  However, Asda said during the last year it had provided two separate increases worth a total of 8% for hourly paid staff. Responding to the criticism, an Asda spokesperson said: ""We have increased retail colleague pay twice during the last 12 months and will confirm our new pay rates for 2023 to colleagues during Q1, following the outcome of negotiations with Usdaw where we have a pay bargaining agreement.""

Aldi is giving thousands of workers a pay rise - see how its hourly rate is changing,"Following two pay increases for hourly-paid warehouse colleagues in 2022, this further rise means colleagues will be paid up to 20% more than at this time last yearAldi is increasing its pay rates for around 7,000 warehouse workers across the UK from February 2023. The budget supermarket's warehouse workers will begin to be paid £13.13 an hour, up from the £11.48 they currently earn now.  This is the third increase since the beginning of last year.  The move follows Aldi’s recent pay review for its store assistants, which came into effect this month, and saw Aldi staff receive an hourly wage of £11.90 nationally, and £12.75, within the M25. The new wages offered to both Aldi's store assistants and warehouse staff exceed the Living Wage Foundations' recommended hourly wage of £10.90.    Giles Hurley, chief executive officer of Aldi UK and Ireland, said: “Just as we promise our customers that we will do all we can to support them, we are equally committed to supporting our amazing Aldi colleagues – as we remain the highest-paying supermarket in the UK. “This announcement recognises the hard work and contribution our colleagues make in serving communities across the country and it’s down to them that we are able to ensure our customers can access fresh affordable food, every single day.” Wages at Aldi have been raised by more than 15% in the last year and the supermarket's commitment to paying staff more has even led to it being named employer of the year in 2022 by The Grocer Magazine.  It is the first UK supermarket to pay a minimum of £11 per hour to all store assistants. The budget supermarket also says it is currently the only supermarket to offer paid breaks, which is worth an additional £871 a year for the average store colleague. Currently, the supermarket has around 457 sites across the UK with seven distribution centres and over 9,000 employees.  Aldi's popularity has increased significantly over the last few years for its cheaper-than-average groceries, particularly during the current cost of living crisis which has seen consumers' finances squeezed significantly.  Aldi was also recently crowned the cheapest supermarket of 2022 by the consumer champion Which? after offering the lowest priced for seven consecutive months, from June to December.  Aldi's fellow german-chain Lidl was the cheapest for five months, from January to May. According to Which? in December a basket of 48 groceries cost £81.63 on average at Aldi - while Lidl shoppers paid £83.24. This was significantly cheaper than other popular supermarkets whose average cost for the same basket ranged from £93 all the way up to £113.

Sainsbury's shoppers about to see HUGE change in 237 stores as key service disappears,"LloydsPharmacy has revealed it is cutting all 237 of its branches in Sainsbury's stores across the UK in 2023 following a review, with the number of job losses unknownSainsbury’s is set to lose its in-store pharmacies across all its stores, it has been announced. LloydsPharmacy revealed it has cut its services following a recent strategic review and blamed “changing market conditions”. The chain had 237 sites within the supermarket which will be removed over 2023. It has not revealed how many pharmacy workers the removals will affect. Kevin Birch, chief executive officer of LloydsPharmacy, said: “This decision has not been an easy one and we understand that our patients and customers may have questions about how the change will affect them “We would like to thank them for their continued support and assure them that we are committed to providing a smooth transition over the coming months.   “I am very grateful to all our colleagues for their dedication to our patients, customers and communities.” The decision comes seven years after LloydsPharmacy first snapped up the pharmacies from the retailer for £125 million. It runs around 1,400 pharmacies across the UK. A Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: “LloydsPharmacy is withdrawing pharmacy services from our stores over the coming months. “We will work with them to ensure customers are clear on how they can access an alternative pharmacy provision to meet their needs.” Mark Pitt, Assistant General Secretary of the PDA Union added: “We have seen many disposals of LloydsPharmacy branches over recent months and we know more may occur, however for every disposal there has been a buyer, therefore patients and communities have seen no reduction in availability, the pharmacy network has not lost capacity and there were no job losses.   “This situation is different and means significant reductions in access to a pharmacy for patients and we expect those who represent communities to be concerned about the loss of a key part of their local NHS service.  “Forward-thinking governments around the UK are seeking to make greater use of pharmacies as the most accessible contact point in the NHS, to reduce pressure on other parts of the healthcare system, so there should be greater community pharmacy capacity, not less. “The PDA Union will be working tirelessly to avoid job losses for pharmacists, and we will be protecting their interests. It’s important in these situations that any distress caused to individuals is kept to a minimum and that everyone is treated with respect and dignity. “Those pharmacists who are PDA members can contact our service centre for advice in due course and in the meantime should ensure they read communications from the PDA.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/shopping-deals/sainsburys-shoppers-see-huge-change-29001812,
Lloyds Pharmacy to close all 237 Sainsbury’s outlets,"Group says move due to ‘changing market conditions’ as industry warns of insufficient government funding. Lloyds Pharmacy is closing all 237 of its outlets in Sainsbury’s supermarkets amid fears of insufficient government funding for the industry. -----------------------------1The group said it was making the closures – which are thought to affect about 2,000 jobs – “in response to changing market conditions”, adding it was “currently exploring options for each individual branch”. -----------------------------2Kevin Birch, the chief executive of Lloyds, said: “This decision has not been an easy one and we understand that our patients and customers may have questions about how the change will affect them. We would like to thank them for their continued support and assure them that we are committed to providing a smooth transition over the coming months.” -----------------------------3The company did not confirm the number of jobs affected. It told the trade journal Chemist+Druggist: “Lloyds Pharmacy is committed to helping patients easily find a suitable alternative provision.” -----------------------------4Sainsbury’s confirmed that the closures would take place over the coming months and said it would “work with [Lloyds] to ensure customers are clear on how they can access an alternative pharmacy provision to meet their needs”. -----------------------------5The closures come about seven years after the supermarket sold its then 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125m. The pharmacy chain was bought last year by the investment firm Aurelius, which also recently acquired the sports fashion retailer Footasylum. -----------------------------6While health and beauty sales are thought to remain strong, pharmacies, like other retailers, have faced rising costs and difficulties in finding staff. -----------------------------7Nigel Swift, the deputy managing director of Phoenix UK, which owns the Numark and Rowlands pharmacy groups, said the Lloyds closures had to be a wake-up call for the government. -----------------------------8He said: “This announcement is the clearest possible sign of the dire situation facing community pharmacy in England as a result of insufficient government funding. Since the start of the pharmacy contract there has been a massive cut in real-term funding, resulting in hundreds of closures. -----------------------------9“At a time when the NHS is in crisis, the community pharmacy network is needed more than ever before. These closures will put even more pressure on already overstretched nearby pharmacies and dilute patient access to essential healthcare services, particularly in deprived communities.” -----------------------------10after newsletter promotion -----------------------------11A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “Community pharmacies play a vital role in our healthcare system and we back them with £2.6bn a year.

You can find your nearest mobile branch or banking hub on the NatWest website. You can also access certain facilities at Post Office branches including cash and cheque deposits, checking your balance and withdrawing cash.

NatWest to close another 23 branches in England and Wales,"High street banks have now announced 87 closures so far this year – see full list of NatWest closures below. NatWest is to shut another 23 branches in England and Wales, adding to a raft of high street banking closures already announced this month. -----------------------------1The sites will close in the first half of this year. The bank said the closures were due to more customers moving to mobile and online banking. -----------------------------2It comes a week after Lloyds Banking Group said it would close 40 Halifax and Lloyds sites in England and Wales. Lloyds said the number of customers visiting the branches it plans to close had dropped by 60% on average over the last five years. -----------------------------3The latest announcement from NatWest means 87 branches have been slated for closure by high street banks so far this year. -----------------------------4A NatWest spokesperson said: “As with many industries, most of our customers are shifting to mobile and online banking because it’s faster and easier for people to manage their financial lives. -----------------------------5“We understand and recognise that digital solutions aren’t right for everyone or every situation, and that when we close branches we have to make sure that no one is left behind.

In October, NatWest announced it planned to close 43 branches, adding to 15 announced in May and 21 in February. In November, HSBC announced it would close 114 branches in the UK, more than a quarter of its network. -----------------------------7after newsletter promotion -----------------------------8Southampton Bitterne Road, 25 AprilBlackpool Lytham Road, 25 AprilLondon Clapham High Street, 26 AprilStroud Bank Buildings, 26 AprilFleet Fleet Road, 27 AprilHeslington Main Street, 27 AprilDunstable High Street North, 3 MayMaidstone Sutton Road, 4 MayExeter St Thomas Centre, 9 MayBootle Stanley Road, 10 MayCrawley Gatwick Road, 11 MayFrome Market Place, 11 MayBroadwater Broadwater Street East, 16 MayColwyn Bay Abergele Road, 17 MayIlminster East Street, 18 MayLondon Marylebone High Street, 23 MaySheerness High Street, 24 MayLlansamlet Phoenix Way, 25 MayCranbrook High Street, 30 MayTorquay Newton Road, 31 MayBirstall Loughborough Road, 1 JuneHorwich Lee Lane, TBCShoreham-by-Sea East Street, TBC -----------------------------9",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/26/natwest-to-close-another-23-branches-in-england-and-wales,

"Supermarkets raised prices of almost 10,000 products right after Christmas","Apparently, price rises by supermarkets just after Christmas are not ""uncommon"" but the number of increases seen this year is almost double than what is expectedBritish supermarkets have upped the prices of nearly 10,000 products in the weekly directly after Christmas, new analysis has revealed. Price rises after the festive period are not “uncommon” as supermarket chains have usually spent several weeks trying to keep prices steady in the lead-up to Christmas. However, this year’s increase, noted by the retail data firm Assosia for The Grocer, was seen as being “unusually“ large. Altogether, around 9,763 products, from 156,555 grocery-based products, were subject to price rises across the UK’s major grocery chains between Boxing Day and January 6. This was slightly higher than the 9,103 product price rises recorded in January 2022.   The Grocer Magazine reported that normally shoppers could expect to see only about 5,000 price increases at this time of year. According to the report, Asda lead the way with price rises having upped the price of around 2,470 products which is around 11% of its entire range.  However, Asda had lowered the prices of around 734 products meaning overall 1,736 items are now more expensive than before. Morrisons took second place having upped the prices of £1,585 of its products and Sainsbury's took third place with a price increase of around 1,329 products.  Although, both supermarkets did reduce the price of a few hundred products taking their increase figure to 1,032 and 1,007 respectively or 8% and 5% of their entire range.    According to this data, Tesco had upped the least with just 741 products, or 3% of its range seeing a price increase.  The UK's favourite discount supermarket Aldi, which was named the UK's cheapest supermarket by Which? in 2022, increased prices on 6% of its range, while Lidl, who received second place, did so on 7% of products. Amongst the categories, drinks saw the biggest price rises with 11% of the range seeing a rise. According to the Grocer, this figure was higher among certain alcoholic drinks, 23% of beer and cider, 15% for spirits, and 7% for wine. Cupboard essentials and frozen food saw an overall increase of 7%, whilst the cost of fresh food saw a 5% rise.  The products with the lowest amount of increases were health and beauty where only 3% of its range saw a rise and baby, which had only 4% of its range upped. In response to the findings, Asda said in a statement that it is “consistently named the lowest-priced traditional supermarket in independent price comparison surveys carried out by Which? and The Grocer”. It added: ""There are a number of reasons why grocery prices vary over time and during this period we also reduced prices on thousands of products.” A Tesco spokesperson said: “With household budgets under increasing pressure we are absolutely committed to helping our customers, by keeping a laser focus on the cost of the weekly shop. We are therefore pleased to be recognised as the retailer doing the most to keep prices down right now. “So whether it’s price matching Aldi on the basics, locking the price of more than a thousand household staples until Easter 2023, or offering exclusive deals and rewards through thousands of Clubcard Prices – we’re more committed than ever to providing our customers with great value.” Morrisons said it was ""working hard to keep prices down"" whilst ""maintaining high standards"" in their stores.  It added: ""Since December we have invested over £16 million to cut the prices on over 50% of our entry-level products to help customers' money go further, particularly during the January squeeze.""

Supermarket shoppers face £788 increase in food bills as grocery inflation hits 16.7%,"New analysis by Kantar shows grocery inflation has hit 16.7% - the highest since their records began in 2008 - as shoppers continue to feel the squeeze of the cost of living crisisFood prices are rising at record rates with supermarket shoppers facing a potential £788 annual increase in the supermarkets. New analysis by Kantar shows grocery inflation has hit 16.7% - the highest since their records began in 2008. The latest data covers the four weeks to January 22 and is a sharp increase on the 14.4% inflation seen in December. In comparison, overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation is now at 10.5%. Take-home grocery sales rose by 5.7% during the four week period and by 7.6% over the quarter, Kantar said. Shoppers snapped up more cheaper supermarket own-brand ranges as they looked to cut costs, with sales of these goods up 9.3%. This is compared to pricier branded alternatives, which were up just 1%.   Sales of no and low alcohol beer were up 3% on last year as Brits committed to Dry January. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: ""Late last year, we saw the rate of grocery price inflation dip slightly, but that small sign of relief for consumers has been short-lived. ""Households will now face an extra £788 on their annual shopping bills if they don't change their behaviour to cut costs.  ""Across the market the move is towards everyday low pricing, with many supermarkets offering price matching and using their loyalty schemes to help shoppers save.  ""As a result of this push, the proportion of spending on promotions has dropped to its lowest level since at least 2008 this month, exaggerating the usual post-Christmas drop off in deals."" Aldi was the fastest-growing grocer for the fourth month in a row, with sales up 26.9% year on year and now holding 9.2% of the market.  Lidl's sales jumped by 24.1% to give it a 7.1% market share. Sainsbury's sales increased by 6.1%, just 0.1 percentage points higher than Asda and Tesco, to give it 15.4% of the market.  Tesco remains the largest British retailer with a 27.5% market share while Asda holds 14.2%. ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/supermarket-shoppers-face-788-increase-29092051,
"Cost of supermarket budget brands rose 20.3% in year to December, survey finds ","Huge rise in cost of own-label ranges outstripped 12.6% increase in supermarkets’ luxury brands. Consumers reliant on supermarkets’ budget ranges bore the brunt of food price inflation in the run-up to Christmas, with increases far outstripping those for luxury own-label and premium brands, according to a survey. -----------------------------1The price of budget items rose 20.3% on average in December, compared with the same month a year before, according to research from the consumer group Which?, while supermarkets’ luxury ranges rose 12.6% and the price of branded items went up 12.5%. -----------------------------2Overall food price inflation averaged 13.3% in December, according to the British Retail Consortium’s latest figures. -----------------------------3However, price hikes for grocery staples including butter and spreads, milk and cheese were much bigger, according to the Which? survey – up 29%, 26% and 22% respectively, across all supermarket chains. Bakery items were up 19.5% and savoury pies, pastries and quiches rose 18.5%. Inflation was lowest for chocolate products,with prices up 6.5% on average. -----------------------------4The biggest individual price rise across all supermarket chains tracked by Which? was Quaker Oat So Simple Simply Apple (8x33g) at Asda, which increased 188% from £1 to £2.88 on average between December 2021 and 2022. -----------------------------5Sue Davies, the head of food policy at Which?, said:“Some households are already skipping meals to make ends meet and our findings show trust in supermarkets taking a hit as many people worry they are putting profits before the people suffering during this cost of living crisis. -----------------------------6“Supermarkets must do more, Which? is calling for them to ensure everyone has easy access to basic, affordable food ranges at a store near them, particularly in areas where people are most in need.” -----------------------------7As the cost of living crisis has deepened, shoppers have turned to discounters Aldi and Lidl in a bid to save money. -----------------------------8However, those retailers’ tight profit margins have given them little room for manoeuvre on rising costs, prompting them to put up prices faster than their bigger rivals in percentage terms, according to Which?. -----------------------------9Prices were up 21.1% year-on year at Lidl and 20.8% at Aldi in December, compared with 13.7% at Sainsbury’s, 13.1% at Tesco and 15.4% at Asda. -----------------------------10Aldi and Lidl remain generally cheaper than their bigger rivals on similar products – so in cash terms, the hit to shoppers pockets is not likely to have been as big. -----------------------------11Several supermarket chains challenged the findings of the Which? survey, saying the products it focused on did not give an accurate picture of inflation in their stores. -----------------------------12after newsletter promotion -----------------------------13Which? tracks annual inflation of tens of thousands of food and drink products across three months at eight major supermarkets – Aldi, Asda, Lidl, Morrisons, Ocado, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Waitrose. -----------------------------14An Aldi spokesperson said: “We are the lowest-priced supermarket in Britain. Our customers will always pay less for their shop with Aldi and that is why Which? has named us as the cheapest supermarket in 2022.” -----------------------------15A Tesco spokesperson said: “With household budgets under increasing pressure we are absolutely committed to helping our customers, by keeping a laser focus on the cost of the weekly shop. Earlier this week, we were pleased to be recognised by The Grocer as the retailer doing the most to keep prices down right now.” -----------------------------16An Asda spokesperson said: “We’re working hard to keep prices in check for customers and remain the lowest-priced major supermarket – a position recognised by Which? in their regular monthly basket comparison.”Andrew Opie, director of food at the British Retail Consortium, said: “Retailers understand the pressure households are under and are doing everything they can to limit price rises on their products. Unfortunately, the war in Ukraine has pushed up the cost of many items including wheat, fertiliser, and animal feed, as well as global energy prices, leading to higher prices for man staples.” -----------------------------17 The headline of this article was amended on 23 January 2023 to clarify that the 20.3% increase is from December 2021 to December 2022.

Supermarket basics soar by 30% as shoppers feel the squeeze - see full list of rises,"The huge increase was highlighted in the Which? inflation tracker, which shows how prices have changed at Aldi, Asda, Lidl, Morrisons, Ocado, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and WaitroseSupermarket basics soared in price by up to 30% on a yearly basis last month - as worrying research shows how shoppers are feeling the squeeze in stores.  The huge increase was highlighted in the Which? inflation tracker, which reveals how prices have changed at Aldi, Asda, Lidl, Morrisons, Ocado, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Waitrose.  Across the eight retailers, butters and spreads went up an eye-watering 29.4%. Milk prices rose by 26.3% and cheese was up 22.3% during the same period. The tracker - which looked at tens of thousands of food and drink products across three months - shows overall food and drink inflation in December was at 15%. It comes as overall Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation was this morning confirmed to have dipped slightly from 10.7% to 10.5% in the 12 months to December. The worst individual price hike noted by the Which? track was Quaker Oat So Simple Simply Apple (8x33g) at Asda which shot up a staggering 188% from £1 in December 2021 to £2.88 in December 2022.   Utterly Butterly (500g) rose 95% from £1 to £1.95 at Waitrose, while one pint of Waitrose Duchy Organic Homogenised Semi-Skimmed Milk (568ml) increased 87.1% from 65p to £1.22. Tesco Creamfields French Brie 200G went up in price by 81.59% from 79p to £1.43. Budget and own-brand items again went up at a faster rate - 20.3% and 18.5% respectively - compared to premium and branded counterparts - up 12.6% and 12.5%.   Lidl prices went up the most at 21.1% in December, followed closely by Aldi at 20.8% - although Which? says both supermarkets are still cheaper overall compared to other stores.  Asda had the third highest inflation where prices rose 15.4%. Inflation rose slightly less at Waitrose at 14.5%, followed by Sainsbury’s on 13.7%, Tesco at 13.1%, Morrisons on 12.9% and Ocado with 10.5%. Supermarket shoppers have told Which? of their dismay over how fast prices are rising.  One participant, a man in his late 30s from the South East, told Which?: “The cost of food from supermarkets is close to unmanageable for many people, including myself. “Given that large supermarkets make huge profits, I feel they could keep their prices down while we struggle with the cost of living.” A 43-year-old woman from Yorkshire and Humberside said supermarkets “don’t care about the consumer and charge whatever they can to make as much profit as possible.”  Sue Davies, Which? Head of Food Policy, said: “We know food prices have risen exponentially in the last year and our inflation tracker shows the dramatic impact this is having on everyday products at the supermarket. “Some households are already skipping meals to make ends meet and our findings show trust in supermarkets taking a hit as many people worry they are putting profits before the people suffering during this cost of living crisis. “Supermarkets must do more, Which? is calling for them to ensure everyone has easy access to basic, affordable food ranges at a store near them, particularly in areas where people are most in need.“  A spokesperson for Asda said: ""We have a long-standing reputation for providing customers with outstanding value and it’s more important than ever that we deliver on this for them. ""We’re focused on keeping prices on branded and own-label products in check to ensure that Asda remains the lowest-priced traditional supermarket as shown by independent research carried out by Which? Magazine.”  A Waitrose spokesperson said: ""With the increase in production costs for primary products and the war in Ukraine, no retailer is immune to inflation, however our overall price inflation is much lower than the examples selected, which have been impacted disproportionately.  ""We’re working very hard with our suppliers to ensure we offer great value, while continuing to deliver industry-leading animal welfare standards, fresh produce grown with care and fair deals for farmers."" A spokesperson for Morrisons said: ""We are working hard to keep prices down and competitive for our customers while maintaining high standards and availability in all our stores. ""Since December we have invested over £16 million to cut the prices on over 50% of our entry level products to help customers' money go further."" An Aldi spokesperson said: ""We are the lowest-priced supermarket in Britain. Our customers will always pay less for their shop with Aldi and that is why Which? has named us as the cheapest supermarket in 2022.  ""Value is the number one consideration for most households and our promise to our customers is that we will always provide the lowest grocery prices in Britain.""

Almost one in 10 local bus services axed over last year in Great Britain,"Exclusive: Cuts come despite government’s levelling up promise to improve transport connectivity. Almost one in 10 local bus services were axed in Great Britain in the last year despite government promises to improve local transport connectivity being a key pillar of its levelling up agenda. -----------------------------1The reductions – equivalent to more than 1,000 registered routes – follow the publication of a national bus strategy for England in 2021, aimed at improving routes and service frequencies. The figures suggest the “bus back better” strategy, conceived under the then prime minister Boris Johnson, has failed to halt the decline in local bus services. -----------------------------2A Guardian analysis of data from the Traffic Commissioners – the body responsible for registration of local bus services – found the number of live registered services fell 9.5% between January 2022 and 2023. -----------------------------3People in communities such as Sheffield, Bath, Lincoln or Stoke-on-Trent, among many others, told the Guardian how axed, unreliable or infrequently serviced bus routes had forced them to abandon medical appointments, house purchases or going to work. -----------------------------4A local bus service used to regularly take Rosa Kell, a disabled pensioner, from Wells in Somerset – often described as England’s smallest city – to Weston-super-Mare, where she would go shopping, meet a friend or visit her dentist. -----------------------------5“On 8 October, the local bus company, First, axed the service, because it was not commercially viable,” she said. “Passengers got a partial route reinstated. The new temporary service is insufficient for workers as it finishes at 5.40pm. It has left many schoolchildren arriving late for school or having to use taxis.” -----------------------------6From April, even this service is predicted to stop, when the government’s bus recovery grant runs out – an England-wide subsidy aimed at helping local bus services recover from the pandemic. The Guardian understands the Department for Transport (DfT) is considering long-term support for the bus sector from April. -----------------------------7“Rural residents are being abandoned by the government,” Kell said. “We’ll have no access to jobs, colleges, larger shops, GPs, or a social life. There is much talk of ‘levelling up’, but where is the level when we have nothing?” -----------------------------8Kell is one of hundreds of people who responded to a Guardian Community callout about public transport options. -----------------------------9Scores of people, many of them elderly, from cities and rural areas such as Somerset, Devon, Worcestershire, Hertfordshire, Lancashire and Cambridgeshire said they were practically stuck at home, cannot access healthcare, shops or education and have given up socialising. -----------------------------10Melissa, a mother and secondary school teacher from Hampshire, said her 12-year-old daughter developed chilblains, an inflammatory skin condition caused by overexposure to cold, after waiting for the bus for an hour at -5C on her way to school last December. -----------------------------11Since a local bus company went out of business last year, she said, pupils had been frequently late for school or left standing by the roadside because buses are too full to pick them up. -----------------------------12John, 53, an NHS call handler at a large Birmingham hospital, said delays of up to an hour on bus routes in the area caused hospital staff to arrive late for work, leaving emergency call handling “severely affected”. His partner, who also works for the hospital, has retired early as a result. “Her department is cut to the bone, but she’s had enough. I may follow suit soon, since I have to leave the house two hours before my shift starts to be on time now.” -----------------------------13Ellen Nierop, a healthcare assistant from Norwich, was one of several who told the Guardian that First Bus representatives were responding to complaints saying: “We are not a public service, we are here to make a profit.” -----------------------------14A First Bus spokesperson did not deny this message was given out to customers, but said the company was “doing everything we can to maintain reliable services” amid “challenging” driver shortages in some areas and “changing customer travel habits post Covid”. -----------------------------15Falling local bus registrations is a trend that has continued for over a decade, matched by a consistent decline in vehicle miles, passenger journeys, and local government funding. DfT figures show the number of miles driven by local buses in England fell 27% in the 10 years ending 2021-22. The pandemic has also had an impact, with a 16% reduction in miles driven between 2020-21 and 2021-22. Passenger journeys have continued to fall, especially on services outside London. -----------------------------16One of the government’s core 12 levelling up missions is to improve local transport connectivity across the UK to the standards of London by 2030. Last year, research by the Campaign for Better Transport found just 40% of transport authorities applying for funding under the bus back better strategy were allocated money, and those that were successful were only allocated 24% of what they had asked for. -----------------------------17Peter Travis, a co-chair of Somerset Bus Partnership, which was set up when bus back better was launched in March 2021, said drastic further cuts of bus routes were inevitable unless the bus recovery grant was extended beyond April. -----------------------------18“The high hopes for bus back better have been dashed as the government cannibalised that funding, designed to improve buses, and used it to keep buses running during Covid,” he said. -----------------------------19“It was going to offer an extraordinary transformation across England. Somerset asked for £165m and got £12m in April last year. We were grateful for the £12m, but we needed £165m to transform our transport here.” -----------------------------20The registration figures do not capture services that have not been de-registered but have instead had their timetables or routes reduced. Not all de-registrations will have meant a reduction in coverage: some operators have also been tidying up their registrations in recent years, and some de-registrations may reflect the removal of competing routes and services from multiple bus companies. -----------------------------21A DfT spokesperson said it was committed to the national bus strategy. They said: “We have invested £2bn to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and help maintain existing bus routes and over £1bn through bus service improvement plans, while still maintaining the annual £250m bus service operator grant to support services. -----------------------------22“We’ve also invested £60m to cap single bus tickets at £2 across England from 1 January to 31 March to tackle congestion and deliver real savings for passengers.” -----------------------------23Gill Page, a self-employed musician and festival director, lives in a village in the prime minister Rishi Sunak’s constituency of Richmond in North Yorkshire. -----------------------------24“Accessing health and other services is almost impossible without private transport in rural North Yorkshire. -----------------------------25“If you catch the local bus that runs once a day at 9.15 and returns at 12.15, it’s £8 for a return journey. Rishi Sunak is usually a good constituency MP, but these kinds of things just really don’t occur to him. There’s no practical need for these issues to occur to him.” -----------------------------26",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/24/almost-one-10-local-bus-services-axed-last-year-great-britain,
"Bus services could be slashed within days without new cash pledge, warns Labour","Labour called on the Government to offer new guarantees under the Bus Recovery Grant as a crunch deadline looms for transport operators and passengersBus companies will start slashing hundreds of services in 10 days unless ministers provide funding guarantees, Labour warned today. The Government’s Bus Recovery Grant is set to expire at the end of March - and operators must give six weeks’ notice of plans to cancel or change routes. Labour’s analysis, based on figures by the Confederation of Passenger Transport released today, reveals more than 1,600 routes could be cut this spring - leaving England with fewer than 10,000 routes for the first time since records began. Over 1,100 routes have been axed in the last year alone. Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh said: “The Conservatives are asleep at the wheel, risking the future of services millions of passengers depend on.” “They have 10 days to act, or services could plunge to a record low.” Read More
  Operators must give 42 days’ notice to the Traffic Commissioner to register changes to or withdrawals of routes. With current funding set to expire from the end of March, the last date for companies to announce cancellations will be February 17 - unless they get certainty from the Government. Buses are the most used mode of public transport in England – with 2.8 billion passenger journeys in 2021/22. But the CPT has warned that up to 15% of bus services in England are at risk unless the Bus Recovery Grant is renewed. Labour said a15% cut would see services fall from 10,941 to 9,300 – a fall of 1,641. It would be the first time they fell below 10,000 since the Traffic Commissioner watchdog began reporting figures. Last April, ministers announced that 31 areas in England, including Liverpool, Norfolk and Cornwall, had been chosen to receive funding from a £1.08bn pot of cash to boost bus services. In March 2021, the Government unveiled its £3bn bus “revolution”, promising “more frequent, reliable, easier to use and cheaper bus services”. The-then Prime Minister Boris Johnson trumpeted the “Bus Back Better” plan, saying: “Buses are lifelines and liberators, connecting people to jobs they couldn’t otherwise take, driving pensioners and young people to see their friends, sustaining town centres and protecting the environment. “As we build back from the pandemic, better buses will be one of our first acts of levelling-up.”  Labour today called on the Government to “give bus operators, communities and local leaders the certainty they need on the future of the Bus Recovery Grant”. The party also urged ministers to “come clean on wider long-term funding for the Bus Back Better strategy”. It said: “Over half of communities are seeing no funding whatsoever from the strategy, leaving the Government’s pledge to transform bus services in tatters.” Ms Haigh added: “After 13 years of the Conservatives, the bus services communities depend on are stumbling from one crisis to the next.” “Labour will reform the broken bus system, giving communities control of their own bus routes and fares, delivering the better bus services that passengers need.” The Department for Transport was contacted for comment. * Follow Mirror Politics on Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter and Facebook ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/bus-services-could-slashed-within-29147556,

Energy firms given days to plan compensation for customers whose homes they broke into,"Furious Grant Shapps has also told watchdog Ofgem to get its act together after failing to haul British Gas over the coals for their appalling actionsGrant Shapps has given energy firms until Tuesday to come up with a plan to compensate customers whose homes they broke into. The furious Business Secretary has also told watchdog Ofgem to get its act together after failing to haul British Gas over the coals for their appalling actions. Companies now face making huge payouts for wrongfully installing prepayment meters in the homes of vulnerable customers. British Gas has said sorry for monstering those with small children or medical conditions by sending debt collectors to break into homes to install prepayment meters. But it admitted that of 1.5 million customers on the meters it had executed around 20,000 warrants to forcibly install them.  Mr Shapps said: “I am appalled that vulnerable customers struggling with their energy bills have had their homes invaded and prepayment meters installed.  “There is a clear duty on suppliers to provide them with support. They need to refocus their efforts on the public who are at the receiving end of this abhorrent behaviour.“ Speaking on Sky News this morning, Mr Shapps said: ""I want to make sure that this does not occur in Britain in modern Britain today, it's absolutely disgraceful no one should have the home invaded like that.""   And he said the regulator must now set up a new customer hotline for households to pass on stories of how they are being treated. Mr Shapps added: “The regulator is too easily having the wool pulled over their eyes by taking at face value what energy companies tell them. “They need to listen to customers to make sure this treatment of vulnerable consumers doesn’t happen again.” Last week some suppliers announced they would suspend forced installations. Now Mr Shapps has told them to share the number of warrants they’ve applied for in recent months and plans to publish the findings.  Ed Miliband, Labour’s Shadow Climate Secretary, said: “Grant Shapps is the do-nothing Business Secretary, who has sat on his hands in the face of the scandal of forced installation of prepayment meters, and simultaneously waves through energy companies making record profits at the expense of the British people. “Thousands more families have had warrants issued for the forced installation of prepayment meters since Grant Shapps refused to act weeks ago. “Now, even after the scandal at British Gas and the millions disconnected by the back door, he still won’t adopt Labour’s call for a total and ongoing ban on the forced installation of prepayment meters until there is wholesale reform of a discredited, rotten and callous system.  “All the while, the Government refuses a proper windfall tax and is willing to let energy companies rake in record profits at the expense of the British people, and is about to allow a 40% rise in average household bills in April.  “Only Labour can fix our broken energy system- ending the prepayment meter scandal, stopping bills going up this April with a proper windfall tax and taking the long term action we need to make Britain a clean energy superpower.” An Ofgem spokesperson said: ""“Our compliance reviews were launched to assess and drive-up standards across the industry. Companies are legally required to submit an honest representation of the facts and we required assessments to be signed off by their Boards. It is an extremely serious matter for any licensee to provide misleading or purposefully inaccurate information as part of these reviews. “What is clear, as the Secretary of State has laid out, is that the picture presented by companies may not accurately reflect what is experienced by customers on the ground. Therefore, further reviews will cross examine what we have had reported to us with direct reports from customers and wider stakeholders, and potentially those involved in delivery of services. This will include finding new ways for customers to highlight their concerns to Ofgem."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/energy-firms-given-days-plan-29134645,
Energy suppliers urged to stop 'outrageous' force-fitting of prepayment meters in homes,"Grant Shapps has urged companies to suspend fitting the meters following reports that British Gas had been sending debt collectors to ""break into"" customers' homesEnergy suppliers are being urged to stop the 'outrageous' practice of force fitting prepayment meters in UK homes. Grant Shapps has urged companies to suspend fitting the meters following reports that British Gas had been sending debt collectors to ""break into"" customers' homes. The Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Secretary issued the plea on Thursday evening, shortly after a meeting between his department and the chief executive of Centrica, which owns British Gas, had taken place. The energy giant said it would stop applying for court warrants to enter customers' homes and fit the meters following reports they had been forced on ""vulnerable"" people. EDF said it had also suspended the practice while it reviewed its processes, and Mr Shapps has urged other suppliers to do the same. He said: ""EDF have now confirmed they have suspended the outrageous practice of forced installation of prepayment meters following the investigation into British Gas. ""I am now calling on all the other energy companies to confirm they are following suit.""   Energy companies can obtain court warrants which give them legal rights to enter people's homes and fit prepayment meters if customers have not paid their bills. Customers must then top up to continue receiving gas supplies and, if they fail to do so, they risk their heating being cut off. BEIS has said that ""forcibly switching customers should only ever be a last resort"" and it would be ""demanding answers to ensure this systemic failure is addressed"". The department said energy minister Graham Stuart met Chris O'Shea, the chief executive of Centrica, on Thursday afternoon, while Ofgem has launched an investigation into British Gas. Mr Stuart said he has asked Centrica to outline in writing how it will ensure the reported incidents will never happen again, and what role Mr O'Shea will take in fixing ""very serious cultural issues"" and in ""regaining the public's trust"". Mr Stuart said: ""I was horrified to read of the mistreatment of British Gas customers - this afternoon I have made it abundantly clear to Chris O'Shea, the chief executive, that this behaviour is completely unacceptable.""  ""I have asked Mr O'Shea to report back to me urgently outlining the role he will take personally to fix these very serious cultural issues,"" he added. ""I told him I want to see these vulnerable, mistreated customers identified and redress provided."" The Times reported that British Gas sends debt collectors to ""break into"" people's homes and ""force-fit"" pay-as-you-go meters - even when customers are known to have ""extreme vulnerabilities"". An undercover reporter for the newspaper worked for debt collecting contractor Arvato Financial Solutions and accompanied agents who used court warrants to gain entry into customers' homes to force-fit these meters. Some of the ""vulnerable"" customers the Times reporter came across while working at Arvato Financial Solutions included a single father with three young children and a mother with a four-week-old baby. Ahead of his meeting with Ms Taplin, Mr Stuart told the BBC: ""It's just appalling, it's not good enough. Only last week  British Gas announced steps they were going to take to support vulnerable customers and it turns out they were doing anything but. ""There are clear rules and they've obviously not been followed and, therefore, I need the regulator and the companies to do the right thing by people who are in the most difficult of circumstances and have been treated on this evidence appallingly."" An Ofgem spokesman said: ""These are extremely serious allegations from The Times which we will investigate urgently with British Gas and we won't hesitate to take firm enforcement action. ""It is unacceptable for any supplier to impose forced installations on vulnerable customers struggling to pay their bills before all other options have been exhausted and without carrying out thorough checks to ensure it is safe and practicable to do so. ""We recently announced a major market-wide review investigating the rapid growth in prepayment meter installations and potential breaches of licences driving it. ""We are clear that suppliers must work hard to look after their customers at this time, especially those who are vulnerable, and the energy crisis must not be an excuse for unacceptable behaviour towards any customer - particularly those in vulnerable circumstances."" An EDF spokesperson said: ""In 2022, we applied for 13,766 warrants in relation to domestic customer debt and in around half of these cases we took the decision not to proceed once the customer had engaged and we understood their circumstances. ""We regularly review and update these processes and so we are confident they are fit for purpose. Nonetheless we are currently reviewing them again to reconfirm they are robust and see if we can make any improvements. ""We have suspended forced installation of prepayment meters while we conduct this latest review."" Simon Francis, co-ordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said: ""Ministers have fallen for the energy industry's spin that they don't use court warrants to install prepayment meters on vulnerable customers.  ""The investigation reveals this not to be the case. ""It is time that the Government stood up to energy firms and banned the forced installation of prepayment meters and the forced switching of smart meters to prepayment mode. ""We also now need a formal inquiry into the prepayment meters scandal and the role of the courts in enabling this practice."" Owner of British Gas, Centrica, announced it was suspending ""all warrant activity"" after the newspaper's article was published. The parent company will also launch an investigation into the claims. Mr O'Shea said: ""Protecting vulnerable customers is an absolute priority and we have clear processes and policies to ensure we manage customer debt carefully and safely. ""The allegations around our third-party contractor Arvato are unacceptable and we immediately suspended their warrant activity. ""Having recently reviewed our internal processes to support our prepayment customers as well as creating a new £10 million fund to support those prepayment customers who need help the most, I am extremely disappointed that this has occurred. ""As a result, on Wednesday morning, we took a further decision to suspend all our prepayment warrant activity at least until the end of the winter. ""More broadly, there are clearly significant challenges around affordability and, unfortunately, we don't see that changing any time soon. ""We need to strike a balance between managing spiralling bad debt and being aware that there are those who refuse to pay and those who cannot pay.  ""We think government, industry and the regulator need to come together to agree a long-term plan to address this and ultimately create an energy market that is sustainable."" Arvato Financial Solutions has been contacted for comment, as has Energy UK, which represents suppliers. Hundreds of thousands of customers have been switched over to more costly prepayment meters, often unwillingly and without the offer of support, after failing to keep up with rising energy payments. Some have found their smart meters switched to prepayment mode remotely while others have been confronted at their door by teams sent by energy companies - armed with magistrates' court warrants - to physically make the change. Just last week, Ofgem said it is to review the checks and balances that energy firms have around placing customers on prepayment meters, warning it will take further legal action if it finds they are not taking due care. In a blog, the watchdog's chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said he is concerned about the ""sharp growth in households struggling to pay their bills being switched over to prepayment meters, sometimes without their even knowing about it, leaving them without heating"". Mr Brearley wrote: ""The numbers of forced installation of prepayment meters is extremely high. It is simply not acceptable that vulnerable customers are left in the dark and cold in winter. ""This review will focus specifically on self-disconnections, remote switching and forced installations, and the checks and balances companies have around any decision to put a customer on a prepayment meter. ""If we find that they have not taken due care in this process, we will take further legal action against them."" Campaigners say those switched often then go without power as they cannot afford to keep the meter topped up - something that is referred to as ""self-disconnection"". It comes after energy bills have soared due to rampant inflation and the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

British Gas debt collectors break into vulnerable people’s homes to force fit meters,"Energy companies like British Gas obtain court warrants which give them the legal right to enter a property and fit the pre-payment meter if customers haven't paid their billsBritish Gas debt collectors are breaking into vulnerable customers' homes to fit prepayment meters, it has been reported.

Prepayment meters: magistrates told to stop allowing forced installations ,"Senior judge makes ruling covering England and Wales amid concerns over vulnerable customers. Magistrates have been ordered to stop issuing warrants allowing energy firms to force fit prepayment meters in England and Wales. -----------------------------1One of the country’s most senior judges, Lord Justice Edis, has told the courts to halt the authorisation of warrants amid concerns over vulnerable customers. -----------------------------2The Guardian revealed on Sunday that more than 30,000 warrants have been issued by magistrates since the start of the year, despite concerns raised before Christmas that the courts were approving warrant requests en masse without scrutiny over whether energy customers were vulnerable. -----------------------------3The energy regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem, last week asked all companies to stop forced installations of prepayment meters after a Times investigation found a debt agency working for British Gas was ignoring customers’ vulnerabilities to break into homes and fit meters. -----------------------------4Edis, who oversees the workings of all courts, said in a statement to magistrates that they had to “act proportionately and with regard to the human rights of the people affected, [in] particular any people with vulnerability”. -----------------------------5He said: “However, it has now come to light that Ofgem has become sufficiently concerned at the operation of suppliers as to ask all energy companies to suspend forced installation of prepayment meters. -----------------------------6“In light of that, applications for warrants of entry for the purpose of installing a prepayment meter should, with immediate effect, cease to be listed and no further such applications are to be determined until further notice.” -----------------------------7Edis said energy firms could still make warrant applications but would need to provide details of their procedures, particularly relating to the vulnerability of people in the household. -----------------------------8Lifting the moratorium would depend on investigations by Ofgem and the government into the area, he said. -----------------------------9Edis said the ruling does not affect applications for warrants in commercial cases “or for other purposes including the investigation of theft or tampering, or safety”. -----------------------------10Ofgem has said it will conduct a review into the handling of prepayment customers and is examining how to remove the cost difference between prepay customers and those on direct debits, who typically pay less for energy. It is also studying whether a social tariff to support low-income households could be introduced. -----------------------------11The business secretary, Grant Shapps, has accused Ofgem of “having the wool pulled over their eyes” by energy company bosses. He has given companies a deadline of Tuesday to report back on what action they will take to help customers who may have had prepayment meters wrongfully installed in their homes – including compensation. -----------------------------12after newsletter promotion -----------------------------13The energy minister, Graham Stuart, responding to a Labour urgent question in parliament on Monday, said: “Since these reports came to light we have acted swiftly and we won’t hesitate to go further to protect consumers. The secretary of state has called for more robust Ofgem enforcement on these issues as well.” -----------------------------14Ministry of Justice figures have shown 32,790 warrants to energy firms were issued last month, including 6,360 warrants the week after Shapps asked suppliers to only install prepayment meters as a last resort. -----------------------------15Citizens Advice have expressed concerns that customers could still be remotely switched on to prepayment tariffs through smart meters. -----------------------------16Labour has accused Shapps of “sitting on his hands” during the crisis. The shadow climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, said on Monday: “Energy companies forcing their way into people’s homes, millions getting disconnected by the back door, no proper windfall tax on fossil fuel profits – this is Britain under the Tories, there is no one else to blame, it’s long past time they got a grip.” -----------------------------17Stuart said Ofgem would decide how long the effective ban on forced prepayment meter installations would last. -----------------------------18",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/feb/06/prepayment-meters-forced-installations-england-wales,

"Pink pigeon allegedly dyed for gender reveal party has died, US officials say","Charity says death of bird named Flamingo in Manhattan likely ‘caused by inhaling the toxins’ from pink dye. A pigeon that was allegedly dyed pink as part of a gender reveal ceremony has died, a bird charity said. -----------------------------1The pigeon, named Flamingo, had captured hearts in recent days after it was rescued in New York City. -----------------------------2Flamingo, who was believed to be less than a year old, was found wandering Madison Square Park, in Manhattan, last week. His plight prompted anger at the person or people who had dyed him pink and have not yet been identified. -----------------------------3The Wild Bird Fund took Flamingo into care and announced the king pigeon’s death Tuesday. -----------------------------4“We are deeply sad to report that Flamingo, our sweet pink pigeon, has passed away,” the Wild Bird Fund said on Twitter. -----------------------------5“Despite our best efforts to reduce the fumes coming off the dye, while keeping him calm and stable, he died in the night. We believe his death was caused by inhaling the toxins.” -----------------------------6The Wild Bird Fund previously told WABC that the bird may have been dyed pink, not a natural colour for a pigeon, to take part in an elaborate gender reveal – ceremonies by which couples learn or reveal the gender of their expected baby. -----------------------------7The pigeon was suffering from long-term malnutrition, the Wild Bird Fund said. The group named the pigeon Flamingo, a nod to the brightly coloured wading birds found in wet habitats in the Caribbean, South America, Africa, the Middle East and Europe. -----------------------------8“Flamingo’s story sparked a lot of emotion and generated interest from around the world,” the Wild Bird Fund said. “We hope the tale of his too-short life will help prevent more acts of careless cruelty.” -----------------------------9People grew concerned about Flamingo’s fate on Thursday when the Wild Bird Fund said the team had been unable to remove the pink dye. -----------------------------10“One problem is that the dye has a very strong odor, and we’re concerned for the bird’s respiratory health,” the group said in an Instagram post at the time. “Birds are highly sensitive to certain fumes, and this pigeon is essentially living inside a cloud.” -----------------------------11Flamingo’s treatment included heat, oxygen and subcutaneous fluids, and medication to counteract the toxin’s effects, the Wild Bird Fund said. But he struggled to eat and digest food. -----------------------------12“This king pigeon, a domestic bird likely raised for food, was malnourished, barely older than a baby and had no survival skills,” said the Wild Bird Fund’s announcement of Flamingo’s death. -----------------------------13“‘Dove releases sound romantic, but take away the decorations and Instagram photos, and they are the equivalent of dumping your helpless pets on the side of the road.

Pigeon dyed pink for gender reveal party dies after being found starving in park,"Flamingo the pigeon was rescued after he was died pink for a gender reveal party in Madison Square Park, New York, US, on January 30 but tragically died from the toxic fumesA pigeon who was found malnourished and dyed pink for a gender reveal party has died, according to officials.  The bird, named Flamingo because of its bright pink colour, was purchased at a poultry market for a gender reveal party in Madison Square Park, New York, US, on January 30. The Wild Bird Fund rescued the bird and took him into their care for treatment after they believed the pigeon was dyed deliberately. However, he tragically died on Tuesday.  The non-for-profit organisation confirmed the bird died after inhaling toxins from the pink dye. Wild Bird Fund said in a statement on Twitter: ""We are deeply sad to report that Flamingo, our sweet pink pigeon, has passed away. “Despite our best efforts to reduce the fumes coming off the dye, while keeping him calm and stable, he died in the night. We believe his death was caused by inhaling the toxins.” The wildlife charity believe the bird was dyed in order for a couple to throw a gender reveal party to announce the sex of their unborn child.   The tradition originally started in the US and has grown in popularity with couples having different ways of announcing the sex of their child.   Some of the gender reveal parties include ballon-popping, which reveals either pink or blue confetti. However, in this instance, a pigeon was dyed pink to reveal the gender of a child. The Wild Bird Fund added: ""Flamingo’s story sparked a lot of emotion and generated interest from around the world.  ""We hope the tale of his too-short life will help prevent more acts of careless cruelty.” The group originally tried to rescue him by bathing him to get ride of the pink dye.  They also used heat, oxygen and subcutaneous fluids, and medication to try and nullify the toxin’s effects on the bird.  However, he was unable to eat and struggled to digest food.  “This king pigeon, a domestic bird likely raised for food, was malnourished, barely older than a baby and had no survival skills,” the group said.  “Dove releases sound romantic, but take away the decorations and Instagram photos, and they are the equivalent of dumping your helpless pets on the side of the road. This is no way to celebrate anything.” The wildlife charity said domestic birds should never be released into the wild as they won't survive. The Wild Bird Fund said in a statement: ""Please never release domestic birds to the wild. ""Not for weddings, funerals, celebrations, art projects, anything. (We'd hope that 'don't dye them' goes without saying, but...) They will starve or be preyed on.

Iowa teen saves man and dog after vehicle falls into icy lake,"Joe Salmon, 17, was ice fishing when he saw a Jeep driven by Thomas Lee, 83, drop through the ice under a highway bridge. A 17-year-old, three-sport athlete from Iowa has earned acclaim as a hero after jumping into an icy lake to save a man in his 80s and a dog who were trapped in a car that had fallen in the water over the weekend – a dramatic rescue caught on camera by a drone. The teen, Joe Salmon, was ice fishing with his mother and watching snowmobile races on East Okoboji Lake when he saw a Jeep driven by 83-year-old Thomas Lee drop through the ice under a highway bridge at about 3pm on Saturday, the local sheriff’s office said in a Facebook post. Lee had been heading to his son-in-law’s fishing shack when he and his six-year-old dog, Cooper – who was in the Jeep with him – ended up trapped in frigid lake water that was 3-4ft deep, the Des Moines Register newspaper reported on Monday. After noticing the Jeep and that its driver was seemingly unable to get out, Salmon called for emergency help on his phone, walked to the car and stepped into the water, which went up to about his chest, the Register added. Salmon told the newspaper he stepped on the rear bumper and tried to open the back door, but he couldn’t, and all the Jeep’s windows were closed. Other bystanders joined him at that point, including one who gave him a knife. With that knife, Salmon shattered the back glass and from there scooped out Cooper the dog. Meanwhile, Lee – with water up to about his waist – couldn’t get out because his foot was stuck between the seat and center console, Salmon recalled. Salmon reportedly said he pulled the console up to free Lee, who got stuck once more before he was able to fully get out of the car. The local sheriff’s office said four other men – Corey McConnell, 30; Kody Harrelson, 26; Cody Chester and Chris Parks, both 27 – helped pull Lee and Cooper to safety. First responders took Lee to a local hospital to be evaluated, but neither he nor Cooper were injured. Salmon was treated for minor cuts from the glass. A store gave him some dry clothes, and he was medically cleared to keep fishing. Soon he caught two, the Register reported. A drone photographer recorded video of the rescue helmed by Salmon and posted it on Facebook. “I’m happy that [Lee] was OK and the dog was OK,” Salmon told the newspaper. “It was just crazy at the time. I’ve never done anything like that.” For his part, Lee reportedly said: “I want to thank the people who helped.” He also expressed gratitude to the store, which took Cooper in and dried him off. Salmon – who wrestles, plays football and runs track – lost his shoes in the water while rescuing Lee and Cooper, according to the Register’s report. His high school track team sent a tweet to Nike asking the sports apparel giant to replace Salmon’s shoes. Nike hadn’t responded when the Register published its initial story on Salmon’s heroics. But ESPN reporter Marty Smith tweeted that he would send over a pair of Michael Jordan sneakers. And the nonprofit Track Guy Foundation also said that it would send “new shoes … Joe’s way”.

The incident took place in Iowa as the north and western parts of the country are frozen by an arctic blast that has brought dangerously frigid temperatures over the past week. Thomas Lee, 83, and his dog Cooper, 6, were trapped inside the Jeep after Lee drove it off the Highway 71 bridge on East Okoboji Lake, Dickinson County, US, at around 3pm (9pm GMT) on Saturday, February 4. Lucky for them, teenager Joe Salmon was ice fishing nearby along with his mother, while watching snowmobile races. Salmon and a few other people ran to the rescue of Lee and his dog, Cooper, and within a few minutes managed to drag them both to safety.

Lee appeared to be in shock as Salmon and the four others told him to get out of the car. Salmon shattered the glass at the rear of the car and scooped the dog out first. By that time, the water was already up to the driver's waist.  Salmon, a wrestler, football player and track runner, later told Des Moines Register : ""I took one step and [the water] went to about my chest.  ""I got on the bumper of the rear and tried opening the back door, but all the windows were locked, but one guy gave me a knife and I hit the back glass a couple of times."" He explained that Lee's foot was stuck between the seat and the centre console, so he had to pull the console up to release him. Lee wasn't injured but was transported to Lakes Regional Healthcare for observation.  Salmon was examined by the ambulance crew for minor cuts from the glass and received dry clothes from the Okoboji Store. Following the incident, the boy went back to fishing and even caught two. He said: ""I'm happy that he was OK and the dog was OK. It was just crazy at the time. I've never done anything like that."" During the rescue, Salmon lost his shoes in the water. A tweet from the Okoboji High School boys' track team tried to get Nike to replace the shoes. Nike hasn't chimed in yet, but ESPN's Marty Smith pledged to send a pair of Jordans.

Almost ALL families struggling to pay energy bills will still be in fuel poverty in 2030,"Ministers have been accused of 'throwing in the towel' on tackling fuel poverty - as Greenpeace UK threatens legal action over the Government's failure to meet requirements to reduce fuel povertyAlmost 95% of families struggling to pay their energy bills will still be in fuel poverty in 2030, analysis shows. Ministers have been accused of ""throwing in the towel"" on tackling fuel poverty. Research shows just 6% of fuel poor households will be out of that category by the end of the decade. Greenpeace UK is threatening legal action over the Government's failure to meet requirements to reduce fuel poverty. The charity said ministers are using outdated fuel poverty data from 2020 in its strategy. The Government said energy efficiency policies would reduce the number of households that were in fuel poverty in 2020 by 12% by 2030. Read More
  However, the number of fuel poor households in the UK - now an estimated 6.7 million - has more than doubled since then due to wholesale energy price rises over the last year. Greenpeace calculated that this means the number of households in fuel poverty will only reduce by 5.8% by 2030. Under the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000, the government is obliged to upgrade as many homes “as is reasonably practicable” of people living in fuel poverty by the end of 2030. Greenpeace’s lawyers believe it is “potentially unlawful” the Government is failing in this “legal duty”. The charity is threatening to take the Government to court unless it immediately carries out a review into its strategy for tackling fuel poverty and demonstrates how the target could be hit. Greenpeace’s head of UK climate Mel Evans said: “By throwing in the towel on tackling fuel poverty the government has shackled the poorest people to the coldest homes and the highest bills.  “Almost a quarter of all households are now in fuel poverty. This is a national crisis yet the government’s failing strategy for tackling it means that at this rate it won’t meet its legally binding 2030 target until close to the end of the next century. “A national home insulation programme can lift people out of fuel poverty, support better health and tackle the climate emergency. Unless the government gets on with it, we'll see them in court.” A Government spokeswoman said: “The fuel poverty target for England is to ensure that as many fuel poor homes as possible achieve a minimum energy efficiency rating of band C by 2030. ""Thanks to government support, the number of homes with this rating or above has already gone from 13% in 2010 to 46% and rising. “Improving the energy efficiency of homes is the best long-term method of tackling fuel poverty, and that’s why we’ve committed over £6.6 billion in this parliament, with a further £6 billion committed to 2028, to ensure all homes meet EPC band C by 2035.” ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/almost-families-struggling-pay-energy-29167934,
Greenpeace threatens legal action over UK failure to meet fuel poverty targets,"Government plans to upgrade energy efficiency of homes will help only 5.8% of fuel poor households by 2030, campaign group claims.

Government plans to upgrade the energy efficiency of homes will help fewer than 6% of fuel poor households by 2030, according to the environmental campaign group. Legislation was introduced in 2014 to set a target to reduce fuel poverty, where people cannot afford to heat their home to an adequate temperature. Ministers committed to improve as many fuel poor homes in England as is “reasonably practicable” to a minimum energy efficiency rating of C by the end of 2030. Energy performance certificates (EPC) were introduced in 2007 to measure energy efficiency – including insulation, heating and lighting – and are ranked from the most efficient, A, to G, which is the least efficient. However, government data obtained under a freedom of information request revealed current policies would only reduce the number of households that were in fuel poverty in 2020 by 12% up to 2030. The request also revealed that the government is working from outdated 2020 data collated before the energy crisis. The rapid increase in wholesale energy prices since 2021 has pushed millions of households into fuel poverty. National Energy Action estimates there are now 6.7 million UK households in fuel poverty – a figure that has more than doubled since 2020. This means that only 5.8% of fuel poor households would be upgraded by 2030 – leaving nearly 95% of households in fuel poverty. In a letter to the energy security secretary, Grant Shapps, Greenpeace said it would take legal action unless government committed to reviewing its strategy to tackle fuel poverty and sets out how it will hit targets. Greenpeace UK’s head of climate, Mel Evans, said: “By throwing in the towel on tackling fuel poverty the government has shackled the poorest people to the coldest homes and the highest bills. “Almost a quarter of all households are now in fuel poverty. This is a national crisis yet the government’s failing strategy for tackling it means that at this rate it won’t meet its legally binding 2030 target until close to the end of the next century.” after newsletter promotion The UK has the least energy efficient housing in western Europe, which means high heating costs for low-income households. It also means housing is directly responsible for about 14% of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating the climate crisis. In November, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, announced further support to improve Britain’s leaky housing stock. He said £6.6bn would be spent during this parliament on energy efficiency, and announced a further £6bn of funding from 2025. A cross-party committee of MPs said earlier this year that a national “war effort” on energy efficiency was required to cut energy bills, reduce climate-heating emissions and ensure energy security. A Government spokesperson said: “The fuel poverty target for England is to ensure that as many fuel poor homes as possible achieve a minimum energy efficiency rating of band C by 2030. Thanks to government support, the number of homes with this rating or above has already gone from 13% in 2010 to 46% and rising.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/feb/09/greenpeace-threatens-legal-action-over-uk-failure-to-meet-fuel-poverty-targets,

Martin Lewis warns of 'national act of harm' coming in April in stark government message,"The Money Saving Expert founder has written to the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt urging him to postpone a planned rise in energy bills. He warns another 1.7million being plunged into fuel povertyMoney Saving Expert founder Martin Lewis has urged the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to postpone April's increase in energy bills.  The consumer champion described the planned hike as a “national act of harm” which could plunge another 1.7million into fuel poverty in the coming months.  In a letter to the Chancellor he said the increase was no longer necessary because wholesale prices have ""come down very substantially"".  He added: ""Postponing the increase is a practical and fair decision, with household energy bills already double what they were the prior winter.  “Crucially the damage to people’s pockets and mental health of another round of energy price rise letters is disproportionate.""  Under the Government's ""energy price guarantee"" typical bills are frozen at an average of £2,500 - but will soon become less generous.  In November the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced the cap will be increased to £3,000 for the average household in April.   There are also no plans by the Government to extend a £400 payment made available to all households across the country this winter.  But speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme Mr Lewis said: “The nation is already shivering with the damage of the cost-of-living crisis and it just seems to me there is no need to do this.  “I would ask the Chancellor to postpone this rise”.  He added: ""To put this national act of harm of increasing the price guarantee for just three months, to throw another 1.7million people into fuel poverty taking it to 8.4 million, it seems unnecessary.""  Mr Lewis said any cancellation would have to happen before the March Budget because by then people will have had letters telling them their bills are going up.  Describing energy prices as ""effictively nationalised"", he added: ""This is the one price mechanism that is fully in the Government’s control and it is choosing to put it up on 1 April.""  Labour's Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the personal finance expert ""is right"".  She added: ""We need to stop bills going up in April.  "" That's why Labour would freeze energy prices - paid for by extending the one-off tax on energy companies making windfall profits from war."" Last month Ms Reeves urged Rishi Sunak to cancel the rise in April as she accused the Prime Minister of ""burying his head in the sand"" as the cost of living soars.She highlighted that many families are looking at a 40% increase in their bills, adding: ""At the same time, energy companies continue to enjoy record profits. This cannot be right."" ",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/breaking-martin-lewis-warns-national-29170850,
"Act now on energy bills subsidy or see fuel poverty surge, says Martin Lewis","Jeremy Hunt urged to reconsider raising state-subsidised energy rate from April as market prices make delay affordable . Jeremy Hunt must act now to reverse plans to raise energy bills from April, MoneySavingExpert’s Martin Lewis has warned, saying the change cannot wait until the spring budget next month. In a letter to the chancellor seen by the Guardian, Lewis warned more than 1.7m more households could be plunged into fuel poverty if he does not urgently commit to freezing energy prices. He said Hunt must reconsider raising the state-subsidised energy rate from April, which is set to increase bills for almost every home. “This cannot wait until the budget – in practice, energy firms will need to know much sooner if the planned rise isn’t happening on 1 April, or they are bound to have to communicate to customers that it is coming,” he wrote to Hunt. Hunt has so far rejected calls to extend the support, instead stressing support for the most vulnerable households. Millions of households are likely to see costs soar by 40% from April. From April there is a planned rise in the energy price guarantee (EPG) – the discounted cost of gas and electricity to consumers – from £2,500 to £3,000 a year for the average household, despite the fact that the wholesale cost of energy has been falling. The Labour party has also been calling for the rise in the EPG to be stopped, funded by extending the windfall tax on the profits of energy companies. That tax has brought in less than expected in receipts; the Treasury had projected it would bring in £55bn but the fall in prices has meant that projection has fallen by billions. In his letter, Lewis said the decision to increase prices was made at a time when wholesale rates were looking to be far higher than they are now. He said the current EPG subsidy may only be needed from April to July because the underlying price cap currently looks like it may be cheaper than even the current EPG rate of £2,500 a year for a typical household. “This means the provisioned government expenditure on the energy subsidy will be billions less than expected when the plans were made, giving significant headroom to enable a postponement. Plus, maintaining a lower EPG will also help reduce inflation,” he said. Lewis said the guarantee was not perfect because it was broad brush, offered to even the richest households, but said it was the most efficient because it was currently the method used. after newsletter promotion “Postponing the increase is a practical and fair decision, with household energy bills already double what they were the prior winter. Crucially, the damage to people’s pockets and mental health of another round of energy price rise is disproportionate,” he said. He cited the charity National Energy Action on the rise in fuel poverty, calling it a “frightening statistic”. Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert, was a key campaigner during the Conservative leadership race to put pressure on the government to introduce the EPG – making sharp criticism of the frontrunner Liz Truss, who initially declined to commit to support. As prime minister, Truss introduced the EPG for two years but it was one of the casualties of her catastrophic mini-budget where unfunded tax cuts caused market turmoil. After sacking her chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, and replacing him with Hunt, the Treasury said the guarantee would only last till March.

Google loses £100BILLION as AI chatbot Bard answers question wrong,"The new Bard feature was shown to make an embarrassing error' after Google boss Sundar Pichai said it would answer questions more intelligently, causing share prices to tumbleA blunder by chatbot Bard has cost Google a staggering £100billion after it got an answer wrong.  The AI machine answered a question about the James Webb space telescope wrong in a promo video after CEO Sundar Pichai brought it in to answer questions more intelligently. The company posted a GIF on Twitter demonstrating Bard, but followers were quick to spot the error. In the clip which has been viewed more than one million times, the bot can be seen responding when given the prompt: ""What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can I tell my nine-year old about?"" But the state-of-the-art technology was shown to fluff it when replying with several answers, including that the telescope took the very first photograph of another planet outside the solar system.   The first picture, in fact, was taken by the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) in 2004, according to NASA. The blunder prompted Google's market value to tumble by £100,000,000,000 after share prices in parent company Alphabet Inc fell by 9%. At its lowest price on Wednesday, shares stood at £81.16, a fall of 8.1% on Tuesday’s price £88.35. The mistake was spotted just before a presentation at Google headquarters at Mountain View in California.  Gil Luria, senior software analyst at D.A. Davidson, said that ""while Google has been a leader in AI innovation over the last several years, they seemed to have fallen asleep on implementing this technology into their search product"". He added: ""Google has been scrambling over the last few weeks to catch up on Search and that caused the announcement Tuesday to be rushed and the embarrassing mess up of posting a wrong answer during their demo."" Investors were also reportedly left underwhelmed by a presentation on the feature, which tech experts said did not appear as refined or polished as competitor Microsoft's already popular chatbot, ChatGPT, which it plans to incorporate into the Bing search engine.

Google AI chatbot Bard sends shares plummeting after it gives wrong answer,"Chatbot Bard incorrectly said James Webb Space Telescope was the first to take pictures of a planet outside the Earth’s solar system. Google’s debut of a new AI-powered search bot got off to a bumpy start after it shared inaccurate information in a promotional video, wobbling investors’ confidence. Google parent Alphabet lost $100bn in market value on Wednesday, feeding worries that it is losing ground to rival Microsoft. Alphabet shares, which slid as much as 9% during regular trading, were flat after hours. Microsoft shares rose about 3% before paring gains. They were also flat in post-market trading. Google’s woes began after Reuters reported an error in its advertisement for chatbot Bard, which debuted on Monday. Alphabet posted a short gif video of Bard in action via Twitter, promising it would help simplify complex topics, but it instead delivered an inaccurate answer. In the advertisement, Bard is given the prompt: “What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can I tell my 9-year old about?” Bard responds with a number of answers, including one suggesting the JWST was used to take the very first pictures of a planet outside the Earth’s solar system, or exoplanets. The first pictures of exoplanets were, however, taken by the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) in 2004, as confirmed by Nasa. At the time of writing, the Bard ad had been viewed on Twitter more than a million times. Bard’s error was discovered just before a presentation by Google that also failed to dazzle investors. “This highlights the importance of a rigorous testing process, something that we’re kicking off this week with our trusted tester program,” a Google spokesperson said. “We’ll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard’s responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information.” Bard is an experimental conversational AI service, powered by LaMDA. Built using our large language models and drawing on information from the web, it’s a launchpad for curiosity and can help simplify complex topics → https://t.co/fSp531xKy3 pic.twitter.com/JecHXVmt8l In contrast, OpenAI, a startup Microsoft is backing with around $10bn, introduced software in November that has wowed consumers and become a fixation in Silicon Valley circles for its surprisingly accurate and well-written answers to simple prompts. Google’s live-streamed presentation on Wednesday morning did not include details of how and when it would integrate Bard into its core search function. A day earlier, Microsoft held an event in which it announced that it had already released to the public a version of its Bing search with ChatGPT functions integrated. Gil Luria, senior software analyst at DA Davidson, said: “While Google has been a leader in AI innovation over the last several years, they seemed to have fallen asleep on implementing this technology into their search product. “Google has been scrambling over the last few weeks to catch up on search and that caused the announcement yesterday (Tuesday) to be rushed and the embarrassing mess up of posting a wrong answer during their demo.” Alphabet is coming off a disappointing fourth quarter as advertisers cut spending. The search and advertising giant is moving quickly to keep pace with OpenAI and rivals, reportedly bringing in founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page to accelerate its efforts. “People are starting to question: is Microsoft going to be a formidable competitor now against Google’s really bread-and-butter business,” said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Wealth Management, which owns Alphabet and Microsoft shares. Lip cautioned, though, that concerns about Alphabet may be overblown, saying: “I think still Bing is a far, far cry away from Google’s search capabilities.” The new ChatGPT software has injected excitement into technology firms after tens of thousands of job cuts in recent weeks and executive pledges to pare back on so-called moonshot projects. AI has become a fixation for tech executives who have mentioned it as much as six times more often on recent earnings calls than in prior quarters, Reuters found. The appeal of AI-driven search is that it could spit out results in plain language, rather than in a list of links, which could make browsing faster and more efficient. It remains unclear what impact that might have on targeted advertising, the backbone of search engines such as Google. Chatbot AI systems also carry risks for corporations because of inherent biases in their algorithms that can skew results, sexualise images or even plagiarise, as consumers testing the service have discovered. Microsoft, for instance, released a chatbot on Twitter in 2016 that quickly began generating racist content before being shut down. And an AI used by news site CNET was found to produce factually incorrect or plagiarised stories.

Crackdown on poor social housing named Awaab's Law after boy who died in mouldy flat,"The father of young Awaab Ishak - who died after living in a mould-infested flat - hailed plans to change the law and said public support 'stopped us feeling alone during this hard time'A crackdown on inhumane social housing conditions will be named after two-year-old Awaab Ishak who died after living in a mould-infested flat. Awaab’s Law will force landlords to investigate and fix damp and mould problems within strict new time limits.  Housing Secretary Michael Gove met Awaab’s family today before announcing the legislation would be introduced as part of the Social Housing Regulation Bill.  The toddler’s parents have been campaigning to change the law following the inquest into their son’s death. Awaab died in December 2020 after living in a damp and mould-covered flat owned by housing association Rochdale Boroughwide Housing (RBH). In November, a coroner concluded he died of a respiratory condition caused by mould.   Awaab’s father complained to RBH for three years but they did nothing to fix the issue. The former boss of the housing provider was removed from the role after the findings were published. The Government continues to block funding to RBH to build new homes until it can prove it is a responsible landlord. The Housing Secretary met the new chief executive of RBH, along with Awaab’s family, on a visit to Rochdale today. His department said a consultation on Awaab’s Law will be launched later this year to set a time limit on how long landlords have to investigate hazards and make repairs. The new rules will form part of the tenancy agreement so tenants can hold landlords to account by law if they fail to provide a decent home.   It comes after activist Kwajo Tweneboa warned that social housing is getting ""worse and worse"". He told the Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee he receives messages “every day” and “every night” of “countless situations” where people are living in appalling conditions. The housing campaigner said he sees everything from cockroach and mice infestations to collapsing ceilings and homes flooded with sewage. The Mirror is campaigning for urgent action to end the housing hell experienced by millions of people.  Awaab’s father Faisal Abdullah said: “We would like to express our thanks to Michael Gove and his team for listening to us and doing the right thing. ""My wife and I still struggle to deal with the loss of our son, but we are finally starting to feel like we are being treated fairly.  ""We hope that Awaab’s Law will help stop any other family going through the pain we have gone through. We would not wish this pain on anybody.”  He thanked the family's supporters and told the public: ""Your support has stopped us feeling alone during this hard time."" The Awaab family's legal team, Kelly Darlington, of Farleys Solicitors and Christian Weaver of Garden Court North Chambers, said: “We are delighted to see that following the tragic and preventable death of Awaab Ishak, significant and overdue changes will be made in the social housing sector, giving tenants stronger rights to challenge their landlords over health threatening hazards in their home – including damp and mould. ""The passing of Awaab’s Law will set time limits for when landlords must act, ensuring that tenants are no longer ignored and enabling tenants to hold landlords to account.  ""While these changes will not bring Awaab back, we are warmed to know that his tragic death has not been in vain.”  Mr Tweneboa said: ""It should never have taken the death of an innocent young boy to prove mould is dangerous to live with, but I hope by this, social landlords will stop blaming tenants and start taking accountability in tackling this issue which has wreaked havoc in homes for many decades. ""I also hope the family of Awaab Ishak feel one step closer to justice for their young boy. Through his story they have now been able to help so many more."" Mr Gove said: “The tragic death of Awaab Ishak should never have happened.  ""He was inexcusably let down and his family repeatedly ignored. I want to pay tribute to Awaab’s family for their tireless fight for justice over the last two years. “Today we have announced tough new laws to force social landlords to fix their homes within strict new time limits. “Those landlords who continue to drag their feet over dangerous damp and mould will face the full force of the law."" The government has already committed to a rapid review of existing guidance on the health impacts of damp and mould. New guidance tailored to the housing sector will be published by this summer.

Father of boy killed by mould in flat welcomes law to prevent repeat,"Faisal Abdullah thanks Michael Gove for announcing ‘Awaab’s law’, after death of two-year-old in Rochdale. The father of two-year-old Awaab Ishak, who was killed by mould in a social housing flat, has welcomed a new law to prevent a repeat tragedy, saying: “We are finally starting to feel like we are being treated fairly.” Faisal Abdullah met Michael Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, on Thursday as the government announced a new “Awaab’s law” that will set deadlines for landlords in England and Wales to tackle reported hazards. Abdullah, whose social landlord repeatedly failed to fix the mould problem in the family flat in Rochdale, blaming it on “family lifestyle”, thanked Gove for “doing the right thing”. Last November, a coroner found mould caused the infant’s death by respiratory failure in 2020. Abdullah said he and his wife “still struggle to deal with the loss of our son”. It then emerged that the landlord, Rochdale Boroughwide Housing, left hundreds of other tenants exposed to harmful damp for nearly two years after Awaab’s death. The social landlord’s chief executive, Gareth Swarbrick, was fired and the chair of the organisation, Alison Tumilty, resigned under pressure from Gove, who continues to block public funding to the landlord to build new homes. “We hope that Awaab’s law will help stop any other family going through the pain we have gone through,” Abdullah said. “We would not wish this pain on anybody.” To create Awaab’s law, the government has tabled amendments to the social housing regulation bill. It said a consultation would be launched this year to set the timeframes within which landlords will have to act to investigate hazards and make repairs. The new rules will form part of the tenancy agreement, so tenants can hold landlords to account by law if they fail to provide a decent home. “The tragic death of Awaab Ishak should never have happened,” Gove said on a visit to Rochdale. “He was inexcusably let down and his family repeatedly ignored. I want to pay tribute to Awaab’s family for their tireless fight for justice over the last two years. Today we have announced tough new laws to force social landlords to fix their homes within strict new time limits. Those landlords who continue to drag their feet over dangerous damp and mould will face the full force of the law.” Polly Neate, the chief executive of the housing charity Shelter, which was part of the campaign for the law, said: “Thanks to the campaigning by Awaab Ishak’s family, the inclusion of Awaab’s law in the social housing regulation bill will ensure landlords deal with serious hazards in social homes in a timely manner. after newsletter promotion “We’re pleased ministers have listened and included these vital amendments. They must now make good on promises to Grenfell United too. Nearly six years after the fire, the bill has to include strong measures that require landlords to be qualified to do the job.

Michael Gove steps in to let three cash-strapped areas hike council tax by up to 15 per cent next year,"MICHAEL Gove has stepped in to allow three cash-strapped areas to hike council tax by 10 to 15 per cent next year — smashing through the usual 5 per cent ceiling. Levelling Up Secretary Gove agreed to the requests from Thurrock, Croydon and Slough councils to help plug huge black holes in their finances. Gove noted “significant failings in local leadership” and “poor decision-making”. Thurrock and Slough will be allowed to raise council tax by 10 per cent, and Croydon 15 per cent. Residents in an average band D home in Croydon will see their bills go up by nearly £250 to around £2,220 a year. Every council is allowed to put their bills up by up to five per cent - but if they want to go higher they need a local referendum to give it the green light. Mr Gove ordered councils to help out those who can't afford the astonishing hikes. Councils up and down the country will get an extra £5.1billion in additional help - a 9 per cent hike in their core spending to help in ""challenging times"". John O’Connell of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: “Taxpayers will be picking up the tab for the dismal failure of their local authority to get a grip on spending. “Time and again, bungling bosses have left council finances deep in the red, expecting hard working residents to bail them out.  “Any increase in council tax should come alongside sensible savings from waste in local budgets, including top level salaries.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21297981/michael-gove-croydon-thurrock-slough-council-tax/,
Fury as thousands sign petition protesting bankrupt London council's 15% tax grab after three crisis-hit authorities were given all-clear to hike levy by more than 5% without a referendum amid cost of living crisis,"Angry locals are fighting back after the Government gave the green light for a three times-bankrupt London borough to raise its council tax by 15%.On Monday, it was announced Croydon Council had received permission from Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove for the tax hike without a referendum after 'significant failures in local leadership'.Outside of the capital, Thurrock and Slough councils were also granted permission to increase council tax by 10% after declaring bankruptcy, while Thurrock has also pleaded for a £636million bailout.Yesterday, campaigners in Croydon set up an online petition demanding the reversal of the decision - which has already amassed over 3,500 signatures.Petition organiser Steven Downes wrote: 'We the people of Croydon reject the imposition of a 15% council tax rise. We should not be asked to pay more to get less.'Funding for Croydon Council from central government has been cut dramatically over the past 13 years, and we receive far less funding per person than neighbouring Lambeth.'Jason Perry, the Conservative mayor of Croydon, insisted the blame lay with the 'financial failures of the previous administration', the BBC reports.He said: ""Given the scale of financial collapse Croydon has experienced, getting back on track will require incredibly difficult decisions.""He added the tax increase would mean ""around an extra £4.50 a week, or 63p a day, for the average property.""Last November, Croydon council was forced to issue a Section 114 notice after becoming insolvent for a third time - admitting it couldn't balance its budget for 2023/24.It has also been obliged to commit to £130million spending cuts in the next financial year.Mr Downes added: 'We note that the Conservative Council that left office in 2014 handed over around £1 billion in debt. This was increased by 50% by the Labour group which ran the council from 2014-22.'Successive councils and successive governments are to blame for the current financial situation in Croydon Council. The one group that is not to blame is Croydon’s residents.'In Monday's announcement, Michael Gove told the House of Commons: 'Following significant failures in their local leadership, governance and financial management, the Government received requests from Thurrock, Croydon and Slough for the flexibility to increase their council tax by an additional amount, to provide extra funding to support their financial recovery. 'Given the exceptional circumstances of these councils, including unprecedented financial deficits driven by poor decision making in the past and the need for ongoing government intervention to drive their improvement and recovery, the Government has decided not to oppose the requests.'The Government is of course conscious of the impact on local taxpayers, particularly those on low incomes, of having to foot part of the bill for their councils’ very significant failings. 'We have been clear to each of the councils that in implementing any additional increases, they should take steps to mitigate the impact on those least able to pay.'Last November , it was reported that almost every local authority is expected to raise council tax by 5 per cent after Jeremy Hunt scrapped restrictions in the Autumn Budget.The Chancellor told MPs he was ending a decade-long cap on council tax increases to allow town halls to impose rises above 3 per cent without holding a referendum.Around 95 per cent of local authorities in England are expected to take advantage of the new powers, tipping average bills over £2,000. The 5 per cent rise would increase the average council tax paid for a Band D home by £98.30 - pushing it from £1,966 to £2,064.30.The Treasury watchdog has estimated bills will now rise by the same proportion in each of the next five years.By 2027-28 the annual increase will be bringing in an extra £4.8billion a year compared to the previous cap of a 3 per cent rise. Croydon council has been contacted for comment. ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11726423/Fury-thousands-sign-petition-protesting-bankrupt-London-councils-15-tax-grab.html,

Grieving dad GUILTY of trying to kill man with machete after blaming him for his son’s death,"A GRIEVING dad has been found guilty of trying to kill a man he blamed for his son's death in an ""eye for an eye"" attack. Samson Price, 48, left Patrick Brown ""millimetres from death"" as he hacked at him with a machete outside a gym in Northwich, Cheshire. Price had blamed Brown for the death of his son Samson Price Jr, 18, who found dead in a pond in Wigan in October 2020. Fuelled by revenge, the dad launched into a frenzied attack on Brown, who was with the teen at the time of his death. Price has now been found guilty attempted murder following a trial at Chester Crown Court. Jurors were told the dad bought a 16-inch machete and electronic tracking device to locate Brown. In September 2021, he lay in wait outside the PureGym before frantically slashing at Brown in front of horrified gym-goers. As Brown attempted to flee, Price screamed ""I'll kill you"" and continued raining blows on his rival. He severed Brown's femur bone and only just missed a major artery, which would have caused him to bleed out within minutes. Price then fled the scene and evaded police for three weeks before eventually handing himself in. Prosecutor Simon Mills said: ""Samson Price intended to kill Patrick Brown, and he came very close to succeeding. ""Patrick Brown’s survival was a matter of sheer luck, and prompt medical care."" The court was told Price's son had drowned in a pond near the family home in Wigan, Greater Manchester. Brown and two other teens were arrested on suspicion of murder after Price found his son's body. But a police probe found the death was accidental as there was evidence the group was taking LSD and Samson Jnr had wandered away alone. Price attempted to claim he did not want to kill Brown but instead ""give him a day of hell"". He told jurors during his evidence he wanted to leave him with scars to remind him of his son's death. Price said:"" He seemed to be happy and was talking to someone on his phone. I was struck by the unfairness of it all. I decided to punish him but not once did I think I was trying to kill him. ""I did not want to kill him but an opportunity presented itself to inflict pain and cause physical scarring which would last for the rest of his life.  ""At no point was I intending to kill him.

Grieving father is found guilty of trying to kill man with machete after blaming him for the death of his son who was found dead in a pond after taking drugs while camping with friends,"A grieving father who launched an 'eye for an eye' machete attack on the teenager he blamed for his son's death was today found guilty of attempted murder.Samson Price, 48, stalked Patrick Brown via a tracker placed on his car and then slashed him with the 16-inch machete as he left a gym in Northwich, Cheshire in September last year.Mr Brown, from Winsford, Cheshire escaped bleeding to death 'by millimetres' as the machete just missed a vital artery but was left with life changing injuries.Price showed no emotion as the jury found him guilty of attempted murder at Chester crown court yesterday.Judge Michael Leeming adjourned sentence until March 24 but warned Price that it would be 'very significant indeed'. He said that guidelines for attempted murder where the victim might need life long care or had a long term effect on the ability to carry out day to day activities ranged from between 25 to 30 years.The jury had heard that Price blamed Mr Brown for the death of his son Samson Junior who drowned in a pond near the family home in Wigan, Greater Manchester in October 2020.Brown and two other teenagers were arrested on suspicion of murder after Mr Price had found his son's body floating in the pond, known locally as Westwood Flash.But a five month police investigation concluded that the death was accidental after evidence that the teenagers had gone to the pond to take the hallucinogenic drug LSD and Samson Junior had wandered away from the others.Prosecutor Simon Mills had claimed that Price, a painter and decorator, had launched 'a pre-planned' attacked which was an 'eye for an eye' bid to avenge his son's death.Mr ills said that Mr Brown cheated death by 'sheer luck' and prompt medical attention after gym goers who had witnessed the attack alerted the emergency services.The trial was shown video footage from the gym's CCTV cameras of Price raining blows on his victim as Mr Brown tried to flee for his life.The jury yesterday rejected Price's claim that he had not intended to kill Mr Brown but had wanted to 'give him a day of hell' and leave him with scars for life which would remind him of his son's death.The court had been told that Price, who handed himself into the police three weeks after the attack, had pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm but had denied attempted murder.He had told the court that he and his wife Rosanna had blamed Greater Manchester police for a ' botched ' investigation which had ' made many mistakes.'He told the court that he had tracked Mr Brown to the PureGym in Northwich and had attacked him as he came out.Price said:' 'He seemed to be happy and was talking to someone on his phone. I was struck by the unfairness of it all. I decided tom punish him but not once did I think I was trying to kill him.'I did not want to kill him but an opportunity presented itself to inflict pain and cause physical scarring which would last for the rest of his life. At no point was I intending to kill him. He was the only person who could tell us what happened to our son.'I wanted to give him a day of heel. I wanted him to have the worst day of his life. I did not decide to act as judge, jury and executioner.' ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11719017/Grieving-father-Samson-Price-guilty-trying-kill-man-machete.html,

Biden says it was 'always my position' to shoot down the Chinese spy balloon and that it was the Pentagon who told him to wait until it was over the Atlantic after Republicans said he should have acted sooner,"President Joe Biden returned to the White House from Camp David Monday to say it was 'always' his intention to shoot down the Chinese spy balloon that a U.S. military jet downed on Saturday.His comments came amid ongoing pressure from Republicans in Congress and criticism that he should have acted sooner, with congressional committees set to look into the matter and lawmakers demanding further briefings.Asked if it was always his view to shoot it down, Biden responded, 'Oh no, it was always my position. Once it came over into the United States from Canada, I told the Defense Department I wanted to shoot it down as soon as it was appropriate.''They concluded we should not shoot it down over land, it was not a serious threat and we should wait until it got across the water.' His comments came as the Pentagon revealed the spy balloon was 200-feet-tall and included a massive payload – one reason officials raised concerns about the risks posed by flying debris in the event of an operation to down it over land.The president was also asked why he thought China would commit such a 'brazen' act.After a long pause, he responded: 'Because they're the Chinese government.'His comments came minutes after White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre defended the shoot-down over the waters off the South Carolina coast.She said it 'wasn't just the safest option, it maximized the chance of recovery' of the payload, 'giving us a better chance to get information from the Chinese surveillance.'Biden also said the incident would not weaken U.S.-Chinese relations.'We've made it clear to China what we're going to do. They understand our position. We're not going to back off.  We did the right thing,' he said.As Navy divers work to recover debris from the downed Chinese spy balloon, a top general said Monday that the U.S. is investigating whether it was carrying explosives, describing it as 200-feet tall, weighing thousands of pounds and with a payload the size of a jetliner. 'So, I can't confirm whether it had explosives or not. Anytime you down something like this, we make an assumption that that potential exists,' said Air Force Gen. Glen D. VanHerck, commander of U.S. Northern Command, on a briefing call with reporters. 'We did not associate the potential of having explosives with a threat to dropping weapons, those kinds of things, but out of a precaution, abundance of safety for not only our military people and the public, we have to make assumptions such as that.'The general's description followed a briefing by National Security Council spokesman John Kirby, who defended President Joe Biden's decision to wait and shoot down the Chinese craft until it was over South Carolina's coastline on Saturday.  'Because the president decided they wouldn't shoot it down until he could do so safely - and that meant over water - that afforded us a terrific opportunity to gain a better understanding, to study the capabilities of this balloon,' he told reporters on a call.   Biden ordered the balloon shot down Wednesday, but under the advice of the U.S. military, it was held off until Saturday, with the Air Force sending an F-22 fighter jet armed with an AIM-9X Sidewinder missile to do the job over water. The delay opened Biden up to political attacks from Republicans, many of whom demanded it shot down above land shortly after it was first reported to be flying above Montana. 'The time that we had to study this balloon over the course of a few days last week, we believe was important and will give us a lot more clarity, not only on the capabilities that these balloons have, but what China is trying to do with them,' Kirby said. 'It hasn't gotten a lot of attention and I understand there's criticism over the fact that it traversed the United States, but again, we took steps to mitigate whatever collection capability that balloon would have over our sensitive military sites,' he added. Kirby wouldn't specify what precautions were taken during the balloon's multi-day flyover. Video of balloon debris was shared by South Carolina news outlets, coming in on a boat near North Myrtle Beach on Sunday.   The debris field is the size of 'more than 15 football fields by 15 football fields, according to the Pentagon.VanHerck said the majority of the debris had been collected, but there was a possibility some could come ashore, and warned people to call the authorities and stay away from it.   Weather conditions had yet to allow undersea recovery efforts to fully begin, Kirby said. But Kirby argued that the remains of the balloon would be helpful to the U.S. 'Our efforts to surveil this balloon and what we will learn from the recovery will prove to be valuable,' he said.  Kirby declined to answer a question about whether Chinese President Xi Jinping had ordered the balloon mission or was even aware of it.'I would like to refrain from getting into any discussions about our intelligence assessments of this,' he said. Kirby noted the balloon incident 'has done nothing to help improve the U.S.-China bilateral relationship.' Secretary of State Antony Blinken delayed a planned trip to China over the balloon debacle. Chinese balloons flew over the U.S. three times during former President Donald Trump's administration, with Biden administration officials saying that those flights weren't known about until after the current president was sworn-in. Biden officials have said they would brief Trump-era officials on the balloon flights, but neither Kirby nor Jean-Pierre would say which officials would receive the briefings and whether that would include the ex-president himself. 'I will say that from every indication that we have that was for brief periods of time, nothing at all like what we saw last week, in terms of duration,' Kirby said of the previous balloon incursions. ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11720039/Biden-says-position-shoot-Chinese-spy-balloon.html,

Putin mercenary who kept ‘skull of a dead Ukrainian’ as prize is shot in the head by assassin in latest targeted attack,"A PUTIN mercenary who kept a ""skull of a dead Ukrainian soldier"" as a prize has been gunned down in a targeted attack. Igor Mangushev was shot in the head and rushed to a hospital in Donetsk, Ukraine, where he is reportedly in a ""grave"" condition. The hit on the sick Russian propagandist happened in the early hours of Saturday, January 4. Analysts claim the assassination attempt may be a warning to the leader of Russia’s mercenary Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin. Mangushev, 36, was one of Russia’s most notable TV spin doctors before he enlisted in Putin's army using the call name, Bereg. Shocking pictures on social media showed Mangushev lying bloodied on a hospital bed connected to life support equipment. His friend Boris Rozhkin shared the image, who described his condition as ""grave"". According to The Daily Telegraph, doctors concluded he was shot from a handgun at close range. No further details of the attack have been confirmed. However, Russia expert Mark Galeotti believed Mangushev had significant ties to the Wagner group and that it could have been a proxy attack. Galeotti said: ""I think we can safely describe this as a hit. ""This could be a warning or taking a pawn off the board. ""Or it is a sign that Mr Prigozhin’s more thuggish rivals feel he is weakened enough that they can move."" In August 2022, Mangushev disgraced himself publicly brandishing the skull of a ""dead Ukrainian fighter"" during a stage show. The skull supposedly belonged to a slain fighter killed near the Azovstal steel plant in Ukraine.  During a speech, deranged Mangushev held up the skull and said: ""We’re alive and this guy is already dead. ""Let him burn in hell. He wasn’t lucky. We’ll make a goblet out of his skull."" He ranted: ""Why can’t there be any reconciliation?  ""Ukraine must be de-Ukrainised. The Russian lands of Novorossiya must be returned back.  ""We are not at war with people of blood and flesh. We are at war with an idea — Ukraine as an anti-Russian state. ""This is the tragedy of Ukrainian soldiers. We don’t care how many we have to kill. ""If we were at war with people we could make peace with them."" Mangushev is supposedly fighting against Ukraine but he is also the head of nationalist movement Light Russia and a creator of a private army ENOT, which is said to have links to the FSB. The chilling performance with the human skull violates the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation and is a war crime in international law. On his Telegram channel, the twisted Russian has also openly called for the killing of civilians. His post read: ""We will burn your houses, kill your families, take away your children and raise them Russians.""

Putin mercenary who 'waved the skull of a dead Ukrainian' and called for civilians to be murdered DIES after he was shot in the head in mystery attack,"A pro-Putin spin doctor who notoriously waved the skull of a 'dead Ukrainian' fighter on stage in a sickening stunt died today after he was shot in the head.Igor Mangushev, 36, had been gravely wounded in hospital for several days after what his wife alleged was an act of 'attempted murder' on Russian-held territory.He died around 6am from wounds sustained in the so-far unexplained shooting on 4 February.The sinister ultranationalist campaigner and propagandist turned fighter was seen in sickening footage on stage in August brandishing the reported skull of an Azov fighter declaring: 'We're alive and this guy is already dead.'Let him burn in hell. He wasn't lucky. We'll make a goblet out of his skull.'The shooting of Mangushev - aka Bereg - has been seen as a likely warning to his 'associate' Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Wagner private army and one of Vladimir Putin's closest cronies.This theory of a 'proxy attack' was voiced by leading Russian expert Mark Galeotti who said: 'I think we can safely describe this as a hit.'He said: 'This could be a warning, or taking a pawn off the board, or a sign that Mr Prigozhin's more thuggish rivals feel he is weakened enough that they can move.'There was no immediate suggestion Mangushev was shot in a revenge act by Ukraine.Today a Ukrainian source US Insider said: 'Remember the sadist Mangushev, who performed with the skull of a murdered Ukrainian soldier from Mariupol?'So, he died. And they shot him with their own shot in the head.'This happened, of course, not at the front ….recently, Mangushev has collaborated with Prigozhin and Wagner PMC.'At the weekend, Mangushev's wife Tatiana Azarevich, posted a video saying he had been struck down at close range away from the frontline.She claimed he was not given adequate medical care, and that the Russian authorities had failed to investigate the shooting.Doctors had told her 'the shot was made at close range, at a 45 degree angle to the back of the head, from top to bottom'.It was 'attempted murder' or an 'execution', she said.She denied claims he was in the Wagner force - run by Prigozhin, but serving with the regular Russian army.'He is an active serviceman of the Russian Army, a captain of the 4th Brigade of the 2nd Army Corps of the 8th Army of the Russian Armed Forces,' she said.A video shows the pair on holiday in Lebanon in November.Mangushev, 36, was the leader of a pro-Russian political movement with links to the FSB security service.In his deranged rant in August, Mangushev declared: 'Why can't there be any reconciliation?'Ukraine must be de-Ukrainized. The Russian lands of Novorossiya must be returned back.'We are not at war with people of blood and flesh. We are at war with an idea — Ukraine as an anti-Russian state.'In his Telegram channel, Mangushev openly called for the killing of civilians.'We will burn your houses, kill your families, take away your children and raise them Russians,' he posted.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11726479/Putin-mercenary-waved-skull-dead-Ukrainian-dies-shot-head.html,

How will 'single-leg' rail tickets work as return tickets are scrapped - how much will it cost commuters and what does it mean for your journey?,"Commuters are bracing for a drastic change to train fares which could see return tickets scrapped in favour of 'single-leg' pricing. It emerged yesterday that train journeys will be sold on a single-fare basis, with transport secretary Mark Harper set to announce the changes tomorrow evening.Return tickets will be removed and passengers will instead purchase cheaper single-leg tickets, which should see some one-way fares almost halved. Currently, the typical off-peak single ticket costs almost the same as a return.But after 12 months of strike action and fare increases, the confusing proposal has now left beleaguered passengers concerned that their daily commutes could soar in price.Travel expert and creator of Seat61, Mark Smith, told Mail Online that the new initiative could actually be a welcomed change - and save commuters money in the long-run.Here MailOnline looks at some of the key questions and what it could mean for you:What changes are going to happen?Once the changes are put into place, there will no longer be return tickets available for commuters to purchase.Instead, they will have the option of the following three tickets:At present, a single ticket from London Paddington to Oxford costs £29.90 and a return is £32.60. Under the new scheme, a single trip would be half the price of a return - so £16.30. Between Durham and London, an off-peak single costs £154, with a return costing only £1 more. The move is supposed to encourage people who want to make journeys on a one-way basis, but are currently deterred because a single ticket costs the same as a return. Passengers could also buy two different single tickets that offer better value - for example an advanced ticket on the outbound journey, and a flexible off-peak ticket for the return leg.What is the current problem with train fares? Commuters and travel experts say train fares at present are both too high, and inconsistent. The railway system in the UK was created in the 20th century by British Rail, which is now arguably outdated. Rules since its privatisation mean an off-peak single ticket is almost the same as a return.Travel expert Mark, who was in favour of the initiative, explained why the changes needed to happen: 'We need a route and branch fares return in the UK, and we now have a great opportunity to do it.'Your decision on the way back is currently affecting your journey on the way out. That's daft. Making it all one way creates a simpler system, picking what you want on the outward and the way back.'The pricing is all over the shop - we need a pricing system that is fair and consistent.'The travel expert said, in order for success, the Government should now do three things:Is single-leg pricing happening anywhere else?Single-leg pricing is becoming a more popular mode of selling tickets with countries across Europe already implementing the initiative, including Germany and Switzerland.Mark added: 'It's a step in the right direction, everyone else does single-leg ticketing because it's logical and sensible.' A trial has also been in place by LNER between  London, Leeds, Newcastle and Edinburgh for the past two years.The scheme proved to be popular and demonstrated that single-leg pricing was a step in the right direction.  Will fares be cheaper or more expensive? Passengers fear the move will actually a be stealth rise in rail costs if discounted return tickets are thrown out and all fares instead offered at current 'single-leg pricing' for every part of a journey journeys. But in theory ticket prices should become cheaper. Single fares should be almost halved – to exactly half the current return fare. The change is expected to be 'revenue-neutral'. This means the total raised from travelers will stay the same – or 'revenue-positive' if more people are attracted to the railway, according to the Independent. Those making routine return journeys should expect to see no difference or interference with their typical routine. However, it is possible that in certain circumstances prices may become more expensive. Speaking of the possible pricing outcomes, Mark said: 'What we haven't seen yet is the proposed prices, we don't know whether they will make the one way cheaper.'It's a much simpler structure and I can save money when I'm going one way or a circular journey.'You've now got the option of mixing and matching a cheap fare - it's a better situation to be with.'I think the prices will be close to if not exactly the saver return. In terms of fare structure, the one way is far easier to sell.'The Department for Transport was unable to confirm whether the price of single tickets will fall when contacted by MailOnline.Are there any downsides to the changes? Railway operators could change their prices to compete with others on the market. However, Mark was confident that it would be 'a good thing' to see the changes implemented as long as the transition is done correctly. He added: 'Once it's in it'll be so simple to book on the internet - you'll just have a simple choice of outward fare and inbound, it'll be a much simpler system.'This is a big improvement and should have happened years ago.'How have commuters responded?  Meanwhile, commuters have reacted with anxiety on social media, with some saying they would choose to work from home to avoid the higher costs.One said: 'Umm this is insane? We already have among the world's highest train ticket prices (on a KM/£ basis) and this is going to prompt significant train ticket price inflation.' A second wrote: 'Return rail tickets being scrapped? This is an outrageous proposal. The increase will be substantial.'Another added: 'The Government are... scrapping return rail tickets? A return currently costs me *slightly* more than a single. 'If they're moving to two singles it had BETTER come with a big price drop. Jesus, might as well not even go to work otherwise.'The introduction of the new public body was halted after it was criticised for being 'nationalisation through a back door'.According to the Telegraph fears had grown GBR was a non-starter but it has been revealed by someone who read a draft of his speech that Mr Harper will show 'the idea that GBR is dead, is dead'It will be responsible for timetabling and ticketing which are currently managed by the Department for Transport.There is also a possibility that paper tickets may also be a thing a of the past as Mr Harper is expected  to hint at the greater use of ticketing technology.Mr Harper is expected to make announcement in Westminster on Tuesday evening. The former deputy chairman of John Lewis and ex-chief executive of British Airways is expected to attend as he conducted a two-and-a-half year 'root and branch' review of the railways on behalf of the government. Critics argued that Mr Johnson's interpretation of Mr William's concept could have meant greater state intervention. Despite the new announcements fears still grow as many believe GBR will throttle the private sector role on the railways. Meanwhile, concerns have been raised by the country's equalities commission over changes to rail services that could impact on disabled and vulnerable travellers. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has responded to a letter signed by dozens of MPs and peers highlighting the impact on some passengers of ticket office closures and the expansion of driver-only operation (DOO) services. The commission said: 'We know that, for many people, public transport provides an essential and sometimes the only means of getting to school or work. It is a critical gateway to opportunity and an important component of the Government's own levelling up strategies. 'We therefore share your concerns that changes to how some rail services operate are making rail travel more inaccessible. 'We have received a number of reports about changes in staffing arrangements at stations and on trains, and allegations that operators are unable to provide reasonable adjustments for disabled travellers, as required by the Equality Act 2010. 'This includes rail services that are under contractual obligation via a National Rail contract with the Secretary of State for Transport.'RMT general secretary Mick Lynch, added: 'We welcome the comments from the EHRC and they reflect the equalities issues raised by RMT since the prospect of ticket office closures and DOO was raised. 'Accessibility is a key component of railways and vulnerable groups such as the disabled must be at the forefront of ministers' minds when making changes to the network. 'RMT is committed to campaigning for disabled passengers and ensuring good terms and conditions for its members.'The commission also said it has 'various regulatory tools' to use in response to concerns. 'In this case, we have written to senior officials at the Department for Transport and to the chief executive of the Office of Rail and Road to remind them of their responsibilities under the public sector equality duty. 'This includes thinking about the equality implications of decisions, monitoring impact and taking action to ensure that rail services are accessible for everyone. 'We will not hesitate to use our other regulatory tools, such as our enforcement powers, where necessary.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11718209/How-single-leg-rail-tickets-work-return-tickets-scrapped.html,
Single rail tickets will be hit by Uber-style surge pricing according to how busy services are as return tickets are set to be scrapped,"Rail fares will fluctuate based on demand under a trial to be announced by Transport Secretary Mark Harper, as he prepares to introduce single leg pricing across Britain. Much like the airline industry, the cost of travel on some London North Eastern Railway (LNER) services will be more or less expensive depending on how many seats have been filled.The Uber-style price surging is an attempt to better manage capacity while also raising revenue, the Department for Transport (DfT) said - and it will be rolled out across the country if it proves successful. Mr Harper will also set out an extension of pay-as-you-go ticketing for train journeys across south-east England, so travellers can tap in and out of railway stations with their debit, credit cards or phones, similar to London's Oyster Card system. Meanwhile, single leg pricing will be introduced across the entire LNER network, which runs between London King's Cross and Scotland via the East Coast Main Line.That means a single fare will always be half the cost of a return. Currently, an off-peak single between Durham and London, for example, costs just £1 less than a return.Many one-way fares will be almost halved as a result of the reform, according to the DfT.LNER, a publicly owned operator, has trialled single-leg pricing on some of its routes since 2020.The DfT said it will consider rolling out the system across all of Britain's rail network depending on the success of the extended pilot scheme.Delivering the annual George Bradshaw address to rail industry leaders in central London on Tuesday night, Mr Harper will provide an update on the future of Great British Railways - a new public sector body to oversee Britain's railways - and how it will work alongside the private sector as 'a guiding mind to co-ordinate the entire network'.He is expected to say: 'Today I am setting out the Government's long-term vision for the future of our railways.'The industry's road to recovery after Covid has been tough, with reform badly needed to win back that lost passenger revenue while putting customers first.'Today's announcement is the latest example of this Government taking bold decisions and getting on with the job.'Growing the economy is rightly one of the Prime Minister's top five priorities, and the measures I announce today will unleash more competition, innovation and growth in an important sector of our economy.'Labour's shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said: 'Whichever ticket you buy, passengers are paying more for less under the Conservatives' broken rail system.'Thirteen years of failure has seen fares soar, more services than ever cancelled, while failing operators continue to be handed millions in taxpayers' cash.'The next Labour Government will put passengers back at the heart of our railways, and build the infrastructure fit for the century ahead, unlocking jobs and growth.'England's regulated fares, which include season tickets on most commuter journeys, some off-peak return tickets on long-distance journeys and flexible tickets for travel around major cities, will increase by up to 5.9% from March 5.Analysis of Office of Rail and Road data by the PA news agency found the equivalent of one in 13 services was cancelled during the four weeks to January 7, representing the worst reliability in records dating back to April 2014.This covered a period when operators were badly affected by an overtime ban introduced as part of industrial action while severe weather also caused disruption.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11721997/Single-rail-tickets-hit-Uber-style-surge-pricing-according-busy-services-are.html,
Big change to train tickets planned – and it could end up costing you more,"A SHAKE-UP to the way we buy our tickets could mean we pay more to travel. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has given the green light to scrap return tickets. A new system of ""single-leg pricing"" will be introduced according to The Telegraph. The change means that two single tickets will equal a return. Passengers will no longer be able to buy return tickets once the change comes in. Instead, they will buy two single tickets. The government hasn't revealed how the change will affect prices but it could mean people end up paying more.  This of course, will depend on the travel provider, journey and distance.  Mark Smith, travel expert and creator of cheap train ticket finder Seat61 told The Sun that the amount of train operators in the UK makes it hard for online ticket retailers to present a clear choice of fully-flexible, off-peak and advance-purchase fares for an outward and inward journeys. ""It makes it harder to present fares in a simple way on ticket machines, and harder to implement effective contactless 'touch in, touch out' systems. ""It also penalises people making open-jaw or circular journeys rather than simple returns."" He said the government should now deliver three things: Transport secretary Mark Harper will announce the changes next week.  The move comes as part of a plan to manage the crisis within the transport network.  Many Brits across the country will be left without any services as members of Aslef and the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) unions walked out last week as part of a long-running dispute over pay and conditions. It was the second strike by train drivers last week, after they took part in the huge day of industrial action on Wednesday, which also involved teachers, university staff, civil servants, bus drivers and security guards. The latest round of talks between union bosses and train operators has seen a significant increase to the offer put on the table. Previously, an offer of a 4% payrise over two years was suggested. However, on January 17, 2023, the RDG (Rail Delivery Group) made its ""best and final offer"" to the RMT leadership. This offer includes a pay rise of 4% from January 2023. and 5% (or minimum £1,750 rise) backdated to January 2022. The deal includes changes to work practices. This offer comes after the January 6, 2023, offer from RDG to Aslef of 4 plus 4 per cent rise backdated to 2022. It includes no compulsory redundancies until March 31, 2024. It is thought that the strikes have had significant cost to the industry as a result. Do you have a money problem that needs sorting?

Pensioner locked in £100k 20-year fight with her neighbours over fence ‘that crossed into her property’,"A WIDOW has been locked in a fight with her neighbours for 20 YEARS after claiming their fence crossed into her property. The long-standing feud has racked up an eye-watering £100,000 in legal fees and two decades of bad blood which Judge Alan Johns has said ""brought misery to her as well as to her neighbours."" Norma Yozin-Smith, 73, claimed the fence between her house in New Barnet and neighbours Anthony and Julie Alexander strayed into her garden.  The widow alleged that the fence violated a boundary line tepidly agreed upon by both parties in 2002. In 2007, both sides enlisted a surveyor who spoke to the respective households and prepared a final letter - before marking out the boundary. Soon afterwards, the Alexanders put up the new fence along part of the new boundary line. The couple assumed a compromise had been fairly reached. However, Yozin-Smith sued the couple, citing a violation of the recommendation made by the surveyor.  She argued that the couple hadn't followed the prescriptions - resulting in her trees and plants ending up in her neighbour's garden. The couple have denied that accusation. Judge Alan Johns has since thrown out Mrs Yozin-Smith's case. Giving his ruling, the Judge said: “All domestic boundary disputes are regrettable, but this one is more regrettable than most. ""It continues despite having already been resolved by a boundary agreement as long as 15 years ago when both sides agreed to be bound by the determination of their shared boundary by a surveyor - who set out his views on the boundary in a report on 9 February 2007 revised by a letter on February 15."" He went on to rule that the marked out boundary line faithfully reflected the surveyor’s report, adding: “I reject entirely her case that the line marked out on the ground failed to reflect the report of 9th February. “It follows that the agreed boundary line is represented by the line marked on the surveyor’s digital plan."" However Judge Johns went on to find that part of the Alexanders’ fence was leaning into Mrs Yozin-Smith’s garden due to dilapidation.  He conceded: “I find that there is a nuisance by encroachment to the extent of half the width of some of the posts”. While refusing to order an injunction against the Alexanders  and ordering them to modify the fence, Judge Johns said Mrs Yozin-Smith should be entitled to a compensatory sum. He concluded: “I have in mind an award of £500.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/property/21265324/neighbours-100k-20-year-fight-over-fence/,
"Judge tells widow, 73, to drop 'obsessive' 20-year boundary dispute with her neighbours which has run up more than £100,000 in court bills","A judge has begged an elderly widow to give up an 'obsessive' 20-year fight over a garden fence which has run up more than £100,000 in court bills and caused 'misery' for her and her neighbours.Norma Yozin-Smith, 73, claimed the fence between her house and neighbours Anthony and Julie Alexander in New Barnet, north London, strayed into her garden, partitioning off some of her trees and shrubs, when it was put up.She had claimed the fence ignored a boundary line mapped out by a surveyor about where the border between their properties lay.But after a trial at Central London County Court, Judge Alan Johns has thrown out the main part of Mrs Yozin-Smith's case, rejecting claims that the boundary was incorrectly marked out. She had also alleged her neighbours undermined her patio foundations by repeated use of a jet spray - another claim dismissed by the judge.The dispute has already run up well over £100,000 in legal bills and Judge Roberts afterwards 'implored' the pensioner to give up her fight, which he said 'brought misery to her as well as to her neighbours.'Mrs Yozin-Smith has also previously sued the Alexanders over alleged leaks from their swimming pool, a claim which was 'struck out' due to delay in August 2021.The Alexanders moved into New Barnet in 1998, raising their family in a quiet and leafy north London street where homes now sell for up to £1m. Mrs Yozin-Smith moved in next door six months earlier.The 'long running saga' over the neighbours' boundary kicked off in 2002 when both households began arguing over the precise dividing point between their gardens, but in a bid to settle the dispute they commissioned a specialist surveyor to fix the boundary line in 2007.The surveyor spoke to both households and prepared a report and final letter, before 'marking out the boundary on the ground,' said the judge.Soon afterwards, the Alexanders put up a new fence along part of the new boundary line.The Alexanders claimed this should have been the end of the rift as both sides had agreed to accept the surveyor's decision, but Mrs Yozin-Smith ended up suing on grounds that the final boundary line contradicted the recommendations made in the surveyor's letter.She claimed that, as a result of the line on the ground being in the wrong place, trees, plants and features belonging to her ended up on the Alexanders' side of the fence.However, in court the couple denied their fence encroached on the pensioner's property and insisted they had 'bent over backwards' to placate her.Judge Johns, giving his ruling, said: 'All domestic boundary disputes are regrettable, but this one is more regrettable than most.'It continues despite having already been resolved by a boundary agreement as long as 15 years ago when both sides agreed to be bound by the determination of their shared boundary by a surveyor - who set out his views on the boundary in a report on 9 February 2007 revised by a letter on February 15.'It seems to me that Mrs Yozin-Smith has long been obsessed with this boundary. It's an obsession which has brought misery to her as well as to her neighbours.'I implore her to give it up and to move on from it for her own good as well as for the good of the Alexanders.'He went on to find that the marked out boundary line faithfully reflected the surveyor's report, adding: 'I reject entirely her case that the line marked out on the ground failed to reflect the report of 9th February.'But while I have rejected her case on the position of the boundary, I consider it's important that a declaration should be made to bring certainty.'It follows that the agreed boundary line is represented by the line marked on the surveyor's digital plan.'I will so declare and ask that Mrs Yozin-Smith abides by that decision.'His judgment was the latest chapter in a 'long-running saga' of disharmony between the neighbours, which included Mrs Yozin-Smith previously suing the Alexanders over alleged leaks from their swimming pool.Her pool leakage claim was 'struck out' due to delay in August 2021.'It's a saga which has continued despite - as I see it - the Alexanders having done all they can to avoid this dispute, and the efforts of the surveyor,' the judge said.However Judge Johns went on to find that part of the Alexanders' fence was leaning into Mrs Yozin-Smith's garden due to dilapidation and was in law a 'nuisance', although the Alexanders have accepted this and agreed to carry out repairs.And he also went on to find that their fence at the front of their house likewise partly encroached onto Mrs Yozin-Smith's property, commenting: 'I find that there is a nuisance by encroachment to the extent of half the width of some of the posts'.He refused to order an injunction against the Alexanders forcing them to repair their front fence, but said Mrs Yozin-Smith should be entitled to a 'modest sum' in compensation.'I have in mind an award of £500,' he told the court.Judge Johns also found there were 'isolated' incidents of trespassing by the Alexanders when they crossed to repair their fence.He dismissed another part of Mrs Yozin-Smith's claim, which alleged her neighbours had undermined her patio foundations by repeated use of a jet spray in their 200-foot garden.The long-running row has run up massive court bills and a decision over who pays the costs of the most recent part of the dispute will be made by the judge at a later date.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11709495/Judge-tells-widow-73-drop-obsessive-20-year-boundary-dispute-neighbours.html,

Morrisons falls further behind rivals as its problems under private equity ownership continue,"Morrisons has lost yet more ground against rival grocers as its woes under private equity ownership continue.The Bradford-based supermarket, once the UK’s fourth biggest, was the only major player except Waitrose to see sales fall in the last three months.It suffered a 1.9 per cent drop, with overall sales in the 12 weeks to January 22 coming in at just under £3.1billion.The rest of the traditional Big Four – Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda – all grew sales by at least 6 per cent, Kantar figures showed.Aldi, which ousted Morrisons from its coveted fourth-place spot after 18 years last September, extended its lead and was the UK’s fastest growing supermarket in the period.Sales soared by 26.9 per cent to over £3.1billion as shoppers flooded in to cut the cost of a weekly shop.Lidl also benefited from an influx of new shoppers, with sales jumping 24.1 per cent to £2.4billion.Morrisons’ share of the grocery market is 9.1 per cent, behind Aldi on 9.2 per cent. It now faces the prospect of being overtaken by Lidl, which makes up 7.1 per cent of the market.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-11698357/Private-equity-owned-Morrisons-lags-rivals.html,
Aldi boss reveals plans for stores in 2023,"THE Aldi boss wants “Brits to celebrate Christmas without breaking the bank."" It comes as he gears up for the discounter to poach more shoppers from its rivals this month than ever before. In an exclusive interview with The Sun, Giles Hurley, Aldi's chief executive, said the supermarket was gearing up for its biggest Christmas on record as the cost of living crisis has prompted shoppers to switch from every other supermarket. Two-thirds of British households now shop with Aldi for bargain staples but also its cut-price Wagyu beef and bottles of £14.99 Veuve Monsigny, which is now the UK’s second biggest champagne brand after Moet Chandon. In September, Aldi overtook Morrisons to be crowned the UK’s fourth biggest supermarket, and over the past twelve weeks, it’s gained over 1.5 million more shoppers, according to Kantar.   Mr Hurley said: ""We might be in the ‘Big Four’, but we will never be part of that club, we’re focused on our model."" He reasons Aldi’s success is largely down to its smaller stores and grocery ranges while 90 per cent of what it sells is its own brand, so it can sell groceries for less. ""We are committed to not being beaten on price."" Aldi’s rapid market share gains have prompted Tesco and Sainsbury’s to launch their own price-matching scheme to stop an exodus of shoppers. Mr Hurley believes the promotions are a ""feather in our cap because it shows that Aldi is the benchmark on price."" As it has become more of a threat, rival bosses have been quick to point out that Aldi is hiking its prices by more than others and Which? recently confirmed the discounter had raised prices by 19% compared to a year ago. These above inflation hikes have raised concerns that poorer households are squeezed further because there isn’t a cheaper alternative. Mr Hurley defends the grocer saying shoppers care about pounds and pennies, rather than percentages, and Aldi has put the average price of an item up by 12p, less than its nearest competitor which has raised prices by 14p while discount peer Lidl has increased it by 17p. While the cheapest, Aldi is not immune to inflationary pressures and this year its profits dived by 86% to just £36million. Mr Hurley says that not being dictated to by public investors or buyout group’s exit timetables was the ""luxury of private ownership."" ""We can take a long-term view and we believe long-term profitability is linked to growth and scale. ""Our market share and growth is very much determined by us having the lowest food prices in the UK."" Mr Hurley admits that Aldi, which will have 980 stores by the end of this year has fallen short of its target of having 1,000 stores by the end of 2022. He blames the delay on lockdowns, labour shortages, planning red tape and interference from rivals, rather than a lack of ambition. ""We might have slowed down, but we’ll never stop."" It is now racing to open 16 new shops in the last three weeks of this year and Mr Hurley says that it will reach 1,000 stores next year and keep going. There continue to be gaps in the south of the country and the capital. Earlier this year it also launched a cashier-less store in Greenwich, south east London in the style of Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology. ""I don’t think people would have expected innovation like that from this group, but there’s a few ripples that need to be ironed out before we roll it out further."" In January Aldi ditched Deliveroo deliveries and is now concentrating on its click-and-collect service that’s currently from 200 stores. While rival Lidl is steadfastly shunning online sales, Hurley says ""watch this space"" when it comes to rolling out click and collect further. ""Online grocery spending might have slowed, but it’s still 11% of the food market, it’s still going to be important.""

Lidl taking £10m a month off its more expensive rivals like Marks & Spencer and Waitrose and Sainsbury's,"Lidl is winning around £10million of business from its more expensive rivals every month as shoppers hunt for bargains.Industry figures from data firm Kantar show customers who usually shop at Marks & Spencer, Waitrose and Sainsbury’s have spent £120million at the German discounter in the past year.That is the equivalent of £10million a month – though the figure rose to £11million in January in a sign the trend is strengthening.Shoppers are switching from traditional supermarkets to the cheaper German rivals to save cash amid the spiralling cost of living crisis. Lidl and Aldi have gained millions of shoppers since inflation spiked last year, and have seen their share of the UK’s grocery market soar.The pair make up 16.3 per cent of all supermarket sales, the latest figures show, larger than any individual grocer apart from Tesco. Lidl said the biggest increase in demand was for its fresh fruit and vegetables and its meat and poultry ranges.Boss Ryan McDonnell said it is clear shoppers are ‘refusing to pay a premium for their groceries’.Lidl wants to follow in Aldi’s footsteps and overtake Morrisons as Britain’s fifth biggest grocer. The Bradford-based grocer was ousted from its coveted top-four spot by Aldi in September.Asked last year if he expects to overtake Morrisons, which has struggled since falling into private equity hands in 2021, McDonnell said: ‘I think so, yeah.’",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-11724191/Lidl-taking-10m-month-expensive-rivals.html,

Chilling moment shark spotted stalking swimmers just yards from busy beach as people scream and flee from water,"TERRIFYING footage showed the moment a massive shark stalked a group of unsuspecting swimmers at a busy beach. Captured in Dongara, Western Australia, a beach goer shared the video of the frightening silhouette inching towards the oblivious swimmers just metres away from where they were located. The shark was spotted in swallow water at Grannies Beach in Port Denison. Panicked witnesses can be heard in the footage, screaming “shark!” and “get out of the water” and the startled bathers are then seen scrambling out. One boy joked: “You’re dinner”, and can be heard laughing in the clip. Beachgoers in the Donagara area are now worried about the safety of the waters and have expressed their concerns for those who regularly swim there.  “Can anyone confirm if there is a shark net at Donagara? If not this is stupidity and luck at its best,” video uploader Rob Paxevanos said. “There is a big tiger that comes in there on a regular basis. See it all the time,” one Facebook user commented under the video. ""It's only a tiger shark he was just cruising around,"" another said. The shark’s species is yet to be identified but experts have said that the size, shape and fin of the mammal could suggest that it is a Great White Shark. It is not uncommon for this dangerous predator to be sighted in waters off Western Australia and many people have jumped to the Great White’s defence. One Facebook user wrote: “Probably happens more than we know just happened to be caught on camera” Another commented: “It’s the risk we take when we enter their ocean.” Following a recent string of shark sightings in the area, local authorities have advised the public to be cautious of their surroundings before swimming in the ocean. This comes after we reported how Stella Berry, 16, was killed in a shark attack in North Fremantle, Australia on Saturday. After jumping into the Swan River to swim with a dolphin she was fatally attacked by a bull shark in front of her friends.  Stella suffered critical injuries after the shark latched onto her leg, and tragically died on the scene. Fremantle District Acting Inspector Paul Robinson said: ""It’s an extremely traumatic event for everyone involved and obviously, anyone that knew the young girl."" Robinson added it was ""unusual"" for a shark to be so far down river, which flows from Perth into the Indian Ocean.  The teenager’s parents Sophie and Matt Berry issued three photos of their daughter and appealed for “space and time we need to grieve our darling girl”. “We are devastated and deeply shocked by the loss of our beautiful daughter Stella,” they said in the statement. “We want to acknowledge the amazing support we have received from our family, friends, authorities and the WA community.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21300878/chilling-shark-stalking-swimmers-beach-scream/,
Huge shark attack update as major missed warning sign that could have saved girl killed by great white is revealed,"THE shark that killed a girl was reportedly sighted 24 hours before the fatal attack - and the missed warning might have cost the teen her life.  Stella Berry, 16, was killed by a shark when she went swimming with friends in the Swan River, Perth on Saturday. The first fatality in the river for 100 years.  An 8ft bull shark, like the one responsible for Stella's death, was spotted near to the traffic bridge where she was killed less than 24 hours before, 7News reported. Crucially, the sighting was only reported to the Western Australian Government's SharkSmart tracker after the 16-year-old's tragic death. The teen had been jet skiing with friends on Saturday around 3.30pm local time when she spotted a pod of dolphins and jumped into the water to swim with them. The shark allegedly then appeared from the murky river waters and dragged her under the surface as terrified friends watched on. A male onlooker was reported to have bravely jumped in and pulled her out of the water.  Police and paramedics rushed to the scene but she was too badly wounded to be saved. Tributes across Australia have been pouring in for the schoolgirl, with friends explaining that her death ""doesn't feel real"". The teenager’s parents Sophie and Matt Berry have appealed for “space and time we need to grieve our darling girl”. “We are devastated and deeply shocked by the loss of our beautiful daughter Stella,” they said.  “We want to acknowledge the amazing support we have received from our family, friends, authorities and the WA community.” Fremantle District Acting Inspector Paul Robinson said: ""It’s an extremely traumatic event for everyone involved and obviously, anyone that knew the young girl."" Robinson added it was ""unusual"" for a shark to be so far down river, which flows from Perth into the Indian Ocean. Bull sharks are not uncommon in rivers, however the last fatal attack in Swan River in North Fremantle took place in 1923, when a 13-year-old boy was killed.  Near-misses have occurred in recent years, including Cameron Wrathall who amazingly escaped from a bull shark attack with only a leg injury.  The father-of-two has been campaigning for better safety measures, including a shark barrier.  The Fisheries Minister, Don Punch, said on Sunday: ""There’s only been six recorded historical attacks in the river, and this would make it seven."" However, he said that they would look into new measures, including shark barriers to protect swimming areas. As the news of the prior-sighting of the vicious beast came to light, another shark was spotted off a busy beach in Dongara, Western Australia on Tuesday. Footage shows the terrifying moment a massive shark stalked swimmers in the shallow waters.  People then begin to scream and shout ""shark!"" and ""get out the water"" as the beast lurks close to the bathers.  The species of the shark has yet to be confirmed, however experts have said that the size, shape and fin could suggest it is a Great White.

Retracing Nicola Bulley's last known movements: Video tracks missing mother's journey along river to bench where her phone was found after she vanished without a trace,"This video retraces the last known journey of missing mother-of-two Nicola Bulley who mysteriously vanished during a 25-minute window last week. The hunt for the mortgage adviser, 45, entered a seventh day today as specialist diving teams continued their attempts to trace her on Thursday.Specialist search teams and sniffer dogs were pictured returning to the river today amid fears Ms Bulley could have slipped and been swept downstream. Below, MailOnline's video revisits the last known movements of Nicola Bulley: 8.45am - Ms Bulley is understood to have left her £300,000 home in the picturesque village of Inskip to drop her two children off at St Michael's-on-Wyre Church of England Primary School at around 8.30am.Her family said the route was like clockwork for the mother-of-two, having parked her car there '1000 times' as part of a daily routine walking the dog through the field Nicola would have left her car in the Hall Lane car park before setting off on her regular walk with Willow, which loops around to finish at the same spot.The pair would have trudged out together before turning left and crossing Hall Lane by the primary school to begin her walk. Ms Bulley would often be seen by other dogwalkers along the route every day and was noticeable because she would look so smart in her clothes.8.50am - At around this time, Ms Bulley and Willow would be passing by the grounds of the Grade I St Michael's Church, just off Blackpool Lane - a stone's throw from where she parked.They then cut down a side street by the church, cross a large metal bridge over the River Wyre, and continue along a narrow footpath running parallel to the river.Willow and another dog briefly interact as another dogwalking witness, who has spoken to the police, leaves the field they were on via the river path.It later emerged that around 8.53am, Ms Bulley sent an email to her boss, Ben Pociecha before logging onto a Teams call eight minutes later.9.01am - At around the 10 minute mark of a brisk walk, they would pass through a meal gate and arrive next to the wooden bench where the missing mother-of-two was last seen.Around now, Ms Bulley joins a conference call with her work colleagues, but is not on camera and has muted her device and is just listening in.Ben Pociecha, the director of Exclusively Mortgages, said there was nothing unusual in the fact she was not on screen.He said: 'It seems as if she was muted and didn't have her camera on. She was listening in whilst walking her dog.'There were numerous parties involved in this. A lot of people attended the call. The police are investigating the call.'9.15am - A dogwalker who had been in a nearby field saw her at 9.15am on a footpath by the River Wyre alongside her spaniel Willow.The night before her disappearance, she had been planning a spa trip with her sister, Louise, and discussing what treatments they'd get - according to her mother, Dot.The witness - who has not been identified - said there had been nothing unusual about her appearance and she was walking her regular route.But the dogwalker, described as a 'key witness' by police yesterday, may have been the last person to see Nicola at around 9.15am on Friday. He was with another two people in the field and police have spoken to him about what he saw.His wife told the Times: 'In the field there were about three people, including my husband. He said there was nothing unusual about her and she seemed completely normal.'I'd often see her and say hello. I always thought she looked very nicely dressed, in her bobble hat and smart Wellington boots. It's just horrible to know she's missing.'9.20am - Nicola is believed to have been seen again by a pensioner in his 70s at this time.He was walking a small white fluffy dog on a lead and later spoke to another woman, who was also in the area around half an hour later.MailOnline understands he alerted her to Willow who by now was running free along the bank.He was called a 'key witness' by police yesterday, who have since located and spoke to him. The Teams call Nicola had dialled into ended at 9.30am, but police have since said she remained logged onto the call. 10am -  The woman who spoke to the pensioner by now has found Willow on the river bank.A local told MailOnline: 'I know the woman who found Willow. She said the dog was near the river bank and close to the bench that Nicola's phone was found.'Police say the springer spaniel was unharmed and crucially dry, meaning the dog had not been in the water. Witnesses described the dog as having been in 'an agitated state'.Willow's lead and dog harness were located on a bench on the river bank.Ms Bulley's mobile phone was also laid on the seat and was still connected to the work conference call.Neighbours have since warned the riverbank was muddy and could have been a risk to falling. 10.30am -  Ms Bulley's partner Paul Ansell says he is alerted by the primary school his partner is missing and their dog found.He sparks the police investigation by ringing the force to tell it his girlfriend has gone missing.Mr Anstell told reporters on Monday: 'I got a call from the school regarding somebody who had found Willow, and Nikki's phone and the dog lead and harness on the bench.'We take the kids to school and take the dog down there - either myself or Nikki - nearly every day.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11705703/Video-tracks-Nicola-Bulleys-journey-river-bench-phone-found.html,
Nicola Bulley’s friends beg cops to explore ‘other avenues’ if they don’t find missing mum in river,"PALS of missing mum Nicola Bulley are begging police to “explore other avenues” in their investigation. The dog walker, 45, disappeared after dropping her children off at school in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, on Friday January 27. Since then there has been no trace of the mum-of-two, leaving her family in agony. Lancashire Police believe Nicola, 45, fell into the river while walking her dog in St Michael's on Wyre. Specialist Group International (SGI) today again searched the water for the mum eleven days after she vanished. But family and friends of Nicola have questioned the police theory that she is in the water. Today Heather Gibbons spoke on the banks of the River Wyre while, below her, Peter Faulding and his team used a sonar to scan the depths. She said: ""As family and friends, the way we are looking at it is, between Peter and his team and the police, we feel we have got the best of the best on that water and hopefully it will be a completion, one way or the other. ""And if they find nothing, then maybe its time to start looking down other avenues."" Earlier Mr Faulding told Good Morning Britain detectives investigating the disappearance ""have got nothing to go on"". He added: ""I personally think, if I rule this stretch of water our where we are working today, I don't think she is here. ""I think there's probably a third party involved."" Today Mr Faulding and his team made repeated sweeps up and down a section of the river using sonar equipment. They were concentrating on an area around and downstream from a bench where Ms Bulley's mobile phone was left, still connected to a work call. The lead to her springer spaniel dog, Willow, and its harness, were also left at the bench. Police divers have previously searched the same area last week amid a huge ongoing hunt for mortgage adviser Ms Bulley, who lived in the village of Inskip, two miles from the river. Police say they have ruled out Ms Bulley leaving that area of the river and suspect she may have gone into the water after an ""issue"" with the dog while walking. After spending Monday searching ""three or four miles"" of the river until it grew dark alongside Lancashire Police, Mr Faulding said: ""It's a negative search, no signs of Nicola.""

Chilling telltale clues Shamima Begum is STILL a threat to Britain as she admits it was ‘exciting’ joining ISIS,"TELLTALE clues reveal Shamima Begum is still not willing to tell the whole truth on her four years with bloodthirsty ISIS fanatics. She makes a fresh bid for sympathy in a new BBC documentary tonight - but also admits it was ""exciting"" being smuggled into Syria to join gun-toting killers. Shamima, now 23, was interviewed at the camp where she is being held in northern Syria following the collapse of the ISIS ""Caliphate"". She was just 15 when she and two school pals sneaked away from home in Bethnal Green, East London, in February 2015. She was ""in love"" with ISIS and desperate to join, she tells BBC2 doc The Shamima Begum Story, which airs tonight at 9pm. The ISIS bride tells how they flew from Gatwick to Istanbul, where an ISIS handler waited with them for a bus. After arriving in Gaziantep near the Syrian border, they met ISIS smuggler Mohammed Rasheed - who was also allegedly selling info to Canadian spies. He secretly recorded video footage of Shamima and her pals Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana at the bus station being helped into separate cars. Shamima says they switched cars ""about seven times"" before crossing into the ISIS badlands. She said: ""We crossed the border. It was just a big field of nothing. ""And there were like men wearing all black with their faces covered, with guns on their arms. ""And it was just a bit surreal, you know, seeing it in person. ""I mean at that time it was kind of exciting. It was kind of exciting, yeah. It was different."" She said she did not think of them as dangerous terrorists, adding: ""No. I thought they're here to protect me. ""They have these guns to protect me and to protect women like me and to protect the Muslims. ""So I did not think in my wildest dreams that they would hurt me."" She also said she never changed her mind about joining ISIS - even after being handed a phone to watch gruesome execution videos. She said: ""I just thought, there's no turning back. I've already done it, I might as well see it through."" Shamima went to ISIS capital Raqqa where she married Dutch jihadi Yago Riedijk - six years older at 21. She has begged to be allowed to return to the UK and has appealed against a decision to strip her of British citizenship. Supporters claim she is a victim of trafficking - but the government says she went to Syria with her ""eyes wide open"" and is a danger to society. Previous reports have claimed she was a member of the brutal ISIS religious police, carried an AK-47 on street patrols and sewed suicide bombers into their explosive vests. She denies all the claims in the new BBC doc, claiming she was ""just a housewife"" who was rarely allowed outside. However the film also reveals Shamima lived for seven months with a mysterious Egyptian who allegedly supplied ISIS with weapons. The ISIS bride claims she did not know his name - but also hails him as a ""father figure"" and says she does not believe he was a notorious arms dealer. It is one of several scenes where she appears reluctant to admit the truth. Shamima claims she ""did not know"" about ISIS atrocities - such as the filmed beheadings of British aid workers - before she left London. She tells the BBC doc: ""I got my news on social media ""And the people I spoke to on social media were saying, no it's not true, it's an exaggeration, they're just trying to make ISIS look bad because they hate Islam."" Filmmaker Josh Baker reminds her the sick videos were not only big news at the time but were all over YouTube and Twitter. She blusters: ""But they were constantly being taken down and like being deleted so it was very hard to watch these videos.  ""And the people who I was talking to who were in ISIS didn't send these videos either."" However she goes on to say she did watch ISIS propaganda portraying Raqqa as ""utopia"". And she admits she was aware of a video of a Jordanian pilot being burned to death in a savage public execution. She claims her close pal Sharmeena Begum - who had already fled to Syria - convinced her it was a media lie. She says: ""Because she was there and I wanted to be a part of the Islamic State and I just... ""It's like when you are in love and you just don't wannFa see the person's faults. ""So you just like, push them to the back of your head or you just completely deny that they are there. You know. ""Like I was in love with the idea of ISIS. So I just always made excuses for them."" Tory MP Tim Loughton hits back: ""I don't believe it. And no reasonable person would believe it. ""However much you are a teenager watching At Home With The Kardashians, doing loads of stuff on social media, being physically welded to your mobile phone - nobody, particularly three intelligent students from East London, could have been absolutely oblivious to the horrors that were being waged by Daesh out in Syria and Iraq at that time. ""It just doesn't wash."" Shamima struggles to stifle a smirk and frequently looks away while being quizzed about her life in ISIS capital Raqqa. She says it ""almost felt like being in a movie"" and gushes about how ""normal"" it was - although very different from Bethnal Green. In a previous interview with The Times, she admitted she was ""not fazed"" by seeing severed heads in bins. In the BBC doc she claims she never witnessed public executions as her husband did not allow her outside. Shamima shifts in her seat when asked if she ever stitched suicide bombers into their vests. She says: ""No. Not at all."" She also denies trying to recruit for ISIS - but laughs when asked if she communicated with friends back in London. ""I don't want to answer that question,"" she says. She also denies receiving any form of ISIS training or being part of the feared Hisbah religious police. However another woman who admits being a member of the Hisbah also speaks to the filmmaker. She reveals she personally saw Shamima at a training camp where women received weapons training and religious instruction. Shamima recalls her happiness at being married to jihadi Riedijk - and her shock when he was sent to jail as a suspected spy days later. The film reveals she lived for the next seven months in the house of an older man who was originally from Egypt. And she appears extremely uncomfortable being asked about his identity. Filmmaker Josh Baker says he asked her about the man known as Abu Qomra repeatedly over six interviews. She gives various answers, at first claiming she can't remember his name, then saying his real name was Saeed. And she adds: ""He was really nice to me, like a father figure."" Smiling nervously, blinking and shaking her head, she claims she had no idea he was a senior figure in ISIS. However a neighbour in Raqqa tells the doc: ""He was responsible for providing weapons. ""He was a vicious person, a bad person - bad in the full sense of the word. ""If she was living with him she would have know all the details about his life. ""It's impossible she didn't know"". Asked about claims he was an armourer for ISIS, Shamima responds: ""I don't believe that."" An intelligence expert tells the film Shamima has good reason to fear being associated with such a dangerous figure. Also in the documentary, Shamima blames the press for ""obsessing"" over her links to ISIS, and moans it would be ""unfair"" to put her on trial for supporting the terrorists. She also apologises for crass comments about the Manchester Arena bombing, which she previously said was ""retaliation"" for air strikes in Syria.  And she says she regrets joining ISIS, and would tell her teenage self: ""Don't do it b***h"". She adds she no longer believes she will get back to the UK, saying: ""Because ISIS was the worst thing of the 21st century and I was a part of it and now I have to face the consequences of my actions. ""And this camp is the consequences of my actions."" The documentary was filmed alongside a ten-part podcast. The BBC was slammed for giving Begum a ""platform"" last month. And an author who also interviewed Begum said she is faking remorse to rehabilitate her image. ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21305502/shamima-begum-isis-exciting-telltale-clues-threat/,
"Shamima Begum's lies v reality: ISIS bride claims she'd never seen an execution video, denies going to terror training camp and said she 'thought she was going to an Islamic utopia'","Shamima Begum has made a fresh plea to be allowed back into Britain after being stripped of her citizenship for travelling to Syria to join ISIS. In a new BBC documentary that aired last night, she once again denies knowing anything about the terror group's atrocities before leaving London and insists that after joining she was more of a 'burden' than an active participant. She tells a similar story in I'm Not A Monster, a controversial 10-part BBC podcast that investigates what happened to her after she left her home in Bethnal Green with two school friends in February 2015. However, her case is undermined by a series of inconsistencies that suggest she has twisted the truth. These range from whether she knew of ISIS atrocities before fleeing the UK to her account of what she did after arriving in Raqqa.Below, we reveal the contradictions in her version of events -    Begum repeatedly claims she 'did not know' about ISIS atrocities before leaving London and believed it was an Islamic 'utopia'. She also insists she did not watch any violent propaganda videos, such as the beheadings of hostages.  'I didn't know about these atrocities because as a 15-year-old I didn't watch the news,' Begum says. 'I got my news on social media where people were saying this is untrue, it's an exaggeration.'Broadcaster Josh Baker points out that the videos were all over social media as well as the news.  She replies: 'But they were constantly being taken down and like being deleted so it was very hard to watch these videos.'And the people who I was talking to who were in ISIS didn't send these videos either.'This was despite comments she made in 2019 to the BBC's Middle East correspondent, Quentin Sommerville, who asked her: 'One of the reasons you joined IS is because you watched some beheading videos, is that right?'She replied: 'Not just the beheading videos, the videos that show families and stuff in the park. 'The good life that they can provide for you. Not just the fighting videos, but yeah the fighting videos as well I guess.'This audio was played back on the podcast, before Baker asked her: 'You've said previously that you did watch ISIS propaganda in London... you said you were aware of the fighting and brutality of ISIS before you left'.'No,' she replied.Tim Loughton, Tory MP on the Home Affairs Select Committee, told the BBC documentary: 'I don't believe her and no reasonable person would. 'However much you're a teenager watching the Kardashians at home and doing a load of stuff on social media nobody - particularly three intelligent students from East London - could have been absolutely oblivious to the horrors being waged by Daesh in Syria at that time.' The documentary sees Begum deny reports she helped stitch ISIS terrorists into their suicide vests. Asked if she was trained by ISIS she replies, 'No'. When Baker doubles down and asks 'at any time during your life in ISIS were you given any form of either religious training or weapons training?' she again says 'no'.However, she is contradicted by Um Khaled, a former member of Hisbah - the terror group's notorious religious police. She recalls seeing Begum in a training camp. 'We were in a training camp. They were only girls of course so didn't have their Niqab on. So that's when I saw her face,' Khaled explains. 'All the girls who join ISIS for the first time are enlisted in this camp. Sometimes there would be religious studies and sometimes they introduced weapons training.'The jihadi bride describes how she stayed with the family of a 'really nice' Egyptian man in Raqqa after her husband was briefly imprisoned. Baker says he asked her about the man, who's name was Abu Qomra, repeatedly over six interviews.She gives a variety of answers, at first claiming she can't know his name, then saying his real name was Saeed.And she says: 'He was really nice to me, like a father figure.'However, a neighbour who supplied Qomra with electricity says he supplied ISIS with weapons.  'He was a vicious person and spoke in an aggressive manner. He was bad - bad in the full sense of the word,' the neighbour says. 'If she was living with him she would have known all the details of his life. It's impossible she didn't know.'Huda Mukbil, a senior Canadian intelligence officer from 2001 to 2017, suggests Begum may have denied knowing the man's real identity to avoid guilt by association. 'There's fear, there's trauma. This association in itself could mean that people could see her as a threat,' she says. 'There are also consequences in terms of what she's able to freely say knowing that any information can also incriminate her.' Begum explains that the ISIS 'capital city' Raqqa seemed 'normal'. 'It was kind of like how I imagined. Everything was functioning and stuff like it was normal life,' she says. She also denies witnessing any public executions because her husband did not allow her to go outside. But in a previous interview with The Times, she described how she saw severed heads in bins. 'When I saw my first severed head in a bin it didn't faze me at all,' she said. 'It was from a captured fighter seized on the battlefield, an enemy of Islam. I thought only of what he would have done to a Muslim woman if he had the chance.'      ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11726851/Shamima-Begums-lies-v-reality-ISIS-brides-story-challenged.html,

‘Porn passports’ to be rolled out in France to verify age of users in world-first move… could it come to UK?,"FRANCE is set to be the first country to force internet users to prove they are over 18 to access sex websites. The so-called ""porn passports"" will be rolled out by September under plans drawn up by the country's digital minister, Jean-Noel Barrot. At the moment in France, people only have to click a button to confirm they are older than 18. But within months users will have to download a government phone application that will give them a digital certificate and code. To access explicit material, the code will need to be entered, Le Parisien reports. Barrot said the system will ""work a bit like the checks from your bank when you buy something online"". He added: ""2023 will mark the end of our children accessing pornographic sites. ""I mean to end this scandal. I intend to have this law respected once and for all."" If websites do not comply with the age verification protocol, they could be banned. It comes as the UK eyes up a potential move to age verification as Tory MPs demand tougher checks on those accessing porn. They have demanded an amendment to the Online Safety Bill before it is put to Parliament, that would force sites where kids can see porn to have age verification within six months. It would cover sites such as Pornhub as well as user-generated platforms including OnlyFans. The proposed amendment is supported by 14 charities. A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: “The Bill already has comprehensive and world-leading provisions in it to tackle underage access to online pornography.  ""Any site hosting pornography will have to put in place robust measures such as age verification to prevent underage access or face huge fines."" A survey of 1,000 youngsters revealed children as young as nine are watching graphic material online. But it also showed how the majority, 41 per cent, asked accessed sexual content on Twitter rather than adult sites. Meanwhile, parents have been urgently warned that their children can access porn and be exposed to fake health advice on TikTok. An investigation by the Sunday Telegraph uncovered videos accessible by kids that contain links to porn, self-harm, and dangerous health advice.

Porn passports which prove you are over 18 will be required to access sex websites in France in world first,"France is set to introduce 'porn passports' to prove a person is over 18 while accessing sex websites - in a world first that aims to prevent children from viewing explicit material. The plan by Jean-Noel Barrot, France's digital minister, will be enforced by September in the latest round of a years-long struggle to protect minors on the internet. Under the new proposal, those wanting to access explicit material will need to download a government phone application that provides them with a digital certificate and code, the Parisien reported. The code will be needed to access a porn website under a system 'which will work a bit like the checks from your bank when you buy something online,' Barrot told the newspaper.'2023 will mark the end of our children accessing pornographic sites,' he added.He said: 'I mean to end this scandal. I intend to have this law respected for once and for all.' Websites could be banned if they do not comply with the age verification regulations. The new law in France follows debate in the UK over amendments to the Online Safety Bill.Tory MPs have written to culture secretary Michelle Donelan to demand tougher age checks for those watching pornography. It is understood that more changes to the bill will be announced before it is put to Parliament, which is expected to be within the next month. The bill will include people smuggling, hate crimes, fraud and revenge porn as 'priority' illegal content. The debate followed the revelation that children as young as nine are being exposed to graphic material on the internet, according to a survey of 1,000 young people. Rather than adult websites, Twitter was the site where the highest proportion of young people – 41 per cent – accessed sexual content.Despite allowing users to set up an account aged 13, it is one of the few social media giants to still allow adult content, provided it is marked sensitive.France's data protection and media regulators Cnil and Arcom are set to announce their latest proposals to rein in porn websites which are in theory subject to a 2020 law requiring age verification.Previous attempts have been held up by privacy and technical concerns, as well as court action by the websites.To its frustration last September, a Paris court ordered Arcom to enter into mediation with several porn websites including market leader Pornhub, holding up efforts to block them.In France currently people have to click a button confirming that they are over the age of 18 - but there are no other checks.  President Emmanuel Macron, who is married to former school teacher Brigitte Macron, promised to make protecting children from porn a priority during his bid for re-election last year.In November, he launched the Children Online Protection Laboratory, an initiative that aims to bring together industry giants and researchers to look for ways to shield minors online.In September last year, a report entitled 'Hell Behind the Scenes' by French senators concluded that there was 'massive, ordinary and toxic' viewing of porn by children.The report found that two thirds of children aged 15 or less had seen pornographic content.The French production industry has been roiled by a series of sexual assault cases in recent years in which women have come forward to allege rape, mistreatment and manipulation by directors and fellow actors.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11721729/France-introduce-porn-passports-verify-age.html,

BBC boss blasts the TV licence fee as a ‘regressive’ tax,"THE BBC’s chairman has blasted the TV licence fee as a “regressive” tax. Richard Sharp yesterday admitted the £159 annual charge penalised the poor, women and pensioners. The Corporation’s chairman was asked by MPs if he still believed the telly tax funding model was the “least worst option”. Mr Sharp replied: “There are issues with the licence. “It’s regressive. In some ways it’s considered anachronistic because there are other countries that adopt other mechanisms. “And there are a number of issues in terms of how we collect the licence fee for pensioners and also issues arising from people’s failure to pay the licence for example, with respect to gender issues, so it is imperfect.” Campaigners argue women are overwhelmingly prosecuted over non-payment as they are usually at home when enforcers call. The government is carrying out a review of the Beeb’s funding, including whether a mandatory fee — which has been frozen for two years — is best. Mr Sharp agreed the BBC must “contribute to that discussion when it arises”. Rebecca Ryan, of Defund the BBC, said: “It is welcome to hear Richard Sharp admit significant issues with the TV licence.  ""People should not be forced to pay, through discriminatory practices, for an organisation out of touch with vast swathes of the country.” ",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21310494/bbc-boss-blast-tv-tax-unfair/,
"BBC licence fee is ‘regressive’ and unfairly penalises women, corporation chairman admits as he says he is open to alternative ideas for funding","The BBC’s chairman has branded the licence fee ‘regressive’ and ‘anachronistic’ as he highlighted how it disproportionately penalises women.Richard Sharp admitted the current funding model for the corporation was ‘imperfect’ and pointed out that other countries were adopting ‘other mechanisms’ such as ‘household taxes’ to pay for public service broadcasting.He said he did not currently have a ‘preferred option’ for funding the BBC, but pointed to issues with the current system, including ‘gender issues’ around people’s failure to pay. Those prosecuted for licence fee evasion are disproportionately female.The BBC boss made the comments to the digital, culture, media and sport committee today.He was there to answer questions about whether he helped facilitate a loan for Boris Johnson before the then Prime Minister backed his appointment to the BBC.In 2021, when Mr Sharp appeared in front of the committee, the BBC boss had described the licence fee as the ‘least worst’ option, but that he had an open mind about its future.Yesterday, he was asked by one MP if he still felt the same way about the licence fee.He replied: ‘There are issues with the licence fee. It’s regressive. In some ways it’s considered anachronistic.‘There are other countries [that] adopt other mechanisms. There are a number of issues in terms of how they fall on individuals.‘Both in terms of how we collect the licence fee, for example pensioners, and also the issues arising from people’s failure to pay the licence fee, including for example how that falls with respect to gender issues.‘So it is imperfect and other countries are adopting household taxes, there are some broadband taxes. There are different ways to ensure that a public service broadcaster is separately funded.’He added: ‘I don’t have a preferred option now and I also think that the BBC should contribute to that discussion when it arises.’Last year, then culture secretary Nadine Dorries signalled the death knell for the licence fee by saying the Government was ‘ready to implement a new way of funding the BBC’.She had then announced a forthcoming review into the BBC’s future funding model.Miss Dorries’ successor Michelle Donelan had also effectively written off the current licence fee model, telling MPs in December it was not ‘sustainable’ in the long term.Miss Donelan was moved to a new role in yesterday’s cabinet reshuffle, with Lucy Frazer named as the new culture secretary.In July last year, a report by peers said that the licence fee was ‘regressive’ and should be replaced with a ‘viable alternative’ system.Members of the House of Lords communications and digital committee had warned the corporation faced ‘stagnation and decline’ if it did not come up with a ‘bold’ new plan for its future.Last year, veteran BBC broadcaster David Dimbleby also called for the licence fee to be changed so the rich pay more for it and the poor pay less. He said what people pay should be based on the council tax band system, as the current one is ‘manifestly unfair’.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11723893/BBC-licence-fee-regressive-unfairly-penalises-women-chairman-admits.html,

"Sex monster, 31, who pretended to be boxing champion Tyson Fury's cousin to seduce women he then raped and tormented with sickening sex attacks is jailed for 27 years","A 'monster' who pretended to be the cousin of boxing champion Tyson Fury in an effort to seduce and rape women has been jailed for 27 years.David Overton, 31, was convicted of 25 offences, several involving sex crimes, after he reinvented himself as 'Davy Fury,' an up-and-coming heavyweight boxer.Overton began his violent affairs with three victims after he ditched his previous fake persona as a multi-millionaire wheeler-dealer inspired by the Leonardo DiCaprio's character in the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street.The latest victims to fall under Overton's spell were initially besotted with him but he began controlling their lives before using his bulk and menace to force himself on them on repeated occasions, a court has heard.Overton - who is also known as David Fury-Walsh - repeatedly raped three women and subjected them to campaigns of horrific abuse after portraying himself as a 'caring and generous man'.He controlled one victim's contact with friends, took her money and even made her eat faeces and film herself drinking urine after subjecting her to sadistic sex ordeals. Another victim was raped at a hotel following a charity function while a third was forced to have intercourse with Overton after he head-butted her during an assault.Police said he controlled the women's finances, taking out loans in their names and manipulating them into handing over their savings on the promise that there would be a big return, which never emerged. In a statement one of the victims, a successful businesswoman, told Chester Crown Court: 'Initially David saw himself as a character inspired by the The Wolf of Wall Street but then he created this new Fury character.'What this man put me through is by far the worst thing I have ever experienced. I was used for my money so he could carry out some sick, twisted fantasy.'The bruises may fade but the psychological scars never will. Even when I sleep he still towers over me, all 6ft 5in of him.'She claimed that Overton was a 'monster in size and nature' who has left her suffering flashbacks. She said the abuse - and its lasting impacts - was so bad that 'sometimes I wish he did kill me'.'This man is no Tyson Fury - he has no regard for any human or animal. His next victim may not be so lucky,' she said.Another victim shared how she had to change her hairstyle so her fringe would 'cover the permanent forehead scar that David gave me'.'I used to be such an extrovert but now I am the complete opposite,' the victim said. A third woman, a police worker, said in a statement: 'I can't count on my fingers the number of times he threatened to shoot me, my family and friends. 'I was so scared when he said that he was going to need a body bag and a cleanup crew to come to my address.'She told the court that Overton would punch, kick and shout at her, adding that she would 'get told off for flinching' during the apparent assaults.The woman also claimed that her dog was 'affected' by Overton's acts of violence and 'will need training to correct his behaviour'.The investigation into Overton began in September 2021 when one of the victims went to Cheshire Police.He was arrested within hours of the report, and while he was in custody two other women became aware of his arrest and built up the courage to report that they were also victims of his abusive and controlling behaviour.Overton denied all the charges but was found guilty by a jury following a four-week trial at Chester Crown Court.He was convicted of 25 offences including 13 counts of rape, four counts of sexual assault, three counts of controlling and coercive behaviour, three counts of actual bodily harm, one count of sexual touching and possession of a knife. Following his release from jail he will be on licence until 2056. The court heard he had 13 previous dishonesty offences on his record under nine different aliases.Sentencing Judge Michael Leeming told him: 'All three women allowed you into their lives and in return you treated them with sustained violence and abuse. You yourself admitted you were a control freak - but insisted that you always respected women.'However these were not respectful actions and in your words, these women were no match for you. The trust, confidence and faith in human nature these victims once had would have not been damaged were it not for your relationships with them.'You do show clear tropes of narcissism and you are a compulsive liar. You pose a significant risk of harm to women and any future women you have relationships with.'Overton had assumed the persona of David Fury-Walsh after he used steroids to bulk up in a gym, got himself a face tattoo, shaved his head and dyed his ginger beard black.As part of his trumped-up claims to be a relative of two-time world heavyweight champion Fury, Overton popped up on social media interviews with boxing blogs in which he talked of 'working for his dream'.One detailed how he had 'worked from the age of 13 to provide for his siblings then gone down the wrong path and prison,' before embarking on the 'road to recovery with glory in his sights'.He also told his victims he hailed from a tough travelling community in Salford, Greater Manchester and once worked as an enforcer for a drugs gang. Overton claimed he was vowing to go straight after a three-year stretch in prison for handling dirty money, Chester Crown Court heard.But in reality the 6ft 5in conman grew up in a council house in Congleton, Cheshire.He underwent his most recent image change after being convicted of fraud following a scheme in which he offered a non-existent £20,000-a-year finance job to a gullible young woman in return for a £1,000 investment in his business. The conman claimed at the time he was a multi-millionaire tycoon who ran a finance firm, MinotaurFX, from a head office in Canary Wharf and held a £1.4billion fund. Overton's own mother eventually rubbished his claims about being Fury’s cousin.David Polglase, prosecuting, told the trial: 'He appears to have been engaging and wildly generous to start, but also soon showed various darker traits, and was not honest about his background, including playing on supposed links to Tyson Fury.'His behaviour was coercive, controlling, violent and descended into sexual offending. All three victims describe sexual activity based on, at best, submission or acquiescence and at worst violence, fear and coercion.He added: 'The defendant is a violent and manipulative bully. He is someone who has to be in control of a situation. He is a fantasist. He is a man who wants his own way. 'He is a man who does not take ""no"" for an answer. He has been shown to be that kind of person, with no respect for women, by the three complainants in this case.'Overton's lawyer William Staunton said: 'He is not a psychopath but a troublesome man. He was on steroids at the time and this affected his ability to control his emotions.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11721613/Sex-monster-31-pretended-Tyson-Furys-cousin-seduce-women-jailed-27-years.html,
"Violent rapist, 31, who claimed to be Tyson Fury’s ‘cousin’ and forced victims to eat their own poo is jailed","A VIOLENT rapist who claimed to be Tyson Fury's cousin and forced his victims to eat their own poo, has been jailed. The ""monster"" David Overton, 31, seduced three victims before sexually assaulting them. Overton's violent affairs began when he ditched his fake multi millionaire persona and reinvented himself a ""Davy Fury"". The conman used steroids to help bulk up and began falsely claiming he was the boxing champ's relative - which his mother soon rubbished. In reality, he grew up on a council estate in Congleton, Cheshire, and had a previous conviction for fraud.  He has today been given 27 years for his horrific acts against women. One woman was forced to eat faeces and drink urine after being subjected to traumatising sex ordeals. Another one of Overton's victims was raped at a hotel after a charity function. The third was forced to have sex with Overton after he headbutted her. Cops say he controlled the women’s finances, took out loans in their names and manipulated them into handing over their savings. In a statement one of the victims said she suffers flashbacks and wish Overton had killed her. The statement read: “Initially David saw himself as a character inspired by the Wolf of Wall Street but then he created this new Fury character. ''What this man put me through is by far the worst thing I have ever experienced.  ""I was used for my money so he could carry out some sick twisted fantasy. “The bruises may fade but the psychological scars never will. ""Even when I sleep he still towers over me, all 6”5 of him. He is a monster in size and a monster in nature.  ""I suffer flashbacks whilst washing up and cleaning the house and sometimes I wish he did kill me. ''This man is no Tyson Fury - he has no regard for any human or animal. His next victim may not be so lucky.” Another victim said: “I changed my hairstyle so that my new fringe covers the permanent forehead scar that David gave me.  ""I used to be such an extrovert but now I am the complete opposite.'' The third woman said in a statement: ''I can’t count on my fingers the number if times he threatened to shoot me, my family and friends.  ""I was so scared when he said that he was going to need a body bag and a clean-up crew to come to my address. ''He would punch, kick and shout at me and then I would get told off for flinching.  ""Even my dog was affected by what he did will need training to correct his behaviour.” At Chester Crown Court, Overton, from Macclesfield, was convicted of 25 offences including 13 counts of rape and four counts of sexual assault. He was also found guilty of three counts of controlling and coercive behaviour, three counts of actual bodily harm, one count of sexual touching and possession of a knife. Sentencing Judge Michael Leeming said he posed as a risk to women in the future. He said: ''All three women allowed you into their lives and in return you treated them with sustained violence and abuse.

We’re fuming after Gary Glitter moved next door to our home – I’ve told our kids what to do if they see him,"GARY Glitter's new neighbours say they fear for their kids' safety after the pop paedo was released from jail. The pervert, 78, has been housed in a secret bail hostel close to a housing estate after serving just half of his 16-year sentence. Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, was released from HMP The Verne on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, under the cover of darkness on Friday. His strict licence conditions state he is prohibited from going anywhere near schools, playgrounds or swimming pools. But families living nearby say they are concerned and have slammed the decision to move him close to ten schools. Dad Jonathan Wilson said he has reminded his children, aged three, four and seven, not to speak to strangers. He told DorsetLive: ""Our children play in the woods which back onto their property, and we had to tell our kids like, don’t talk to them, don’t go near anyone there. ""Personally, I don’t like those sort of people full stop, the fact they’re slap bang in the middle of where we live. Talk about taking the p*** out of society. ""This is enemy number one, and they’ve released them into the community."" Jonathan said people in the area were ""pretty emotional"" when Glitter arrived. He added: ""People don’t want him around, certainly not in the middle of where people live. ""You’d think these people would be moved in the middle of a field, not where kids are."" Not long after Glitter arrived, cops were called after vigilantes climbed gates and stormed the grounds. Angry locals turned up when the location was shared on social media and screamed abuse at those leaving. It comes after we revealed the pop paedo was being treated like ""royalty"" and having his meals delivered to his room. The pervert is said to be “really happy and upbeat” at the hostel following his release from HMP Verne in Dorset in the early hours of Friday morning.  He was settled in and fitted with a GPS tag, before being reminded of his strict licence conditions. They include abiding by a nightly curfew, a ban on working without prior approval, no travel outside the UK and no contact with the media. He is also barred from living with anyone under the age of 18 and cannot go near schools, playgrounds or swimming pools. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""Sex offenders like Paul Gadd are closely monitored by the police and Probation Service and face some of the strictest licence conditions including being fitted with a GPS tag. ""If the offender breaches these conditions at any point, they can go back behind bars. ""We’ve already introduced tougher sentences for the worst offenders and ended the automatic halfway release for serious crimes."" Glitter was one of the UK’s biggest glam rock stars of the 1970s and a familiar face on BBC TV chart show Top of the Pops. He had a string of hits including three UK No 1 singles: I’m the Leader of the Gang (I Am!), I Love You Love Me Love and Always Yours. Glitter’s fall from grace began in 1997 when he took a laptop into a Bristol branch of PC World for repair and an engineer found child abuse images on the hard drive.  Two years later the singer was jailed for four months after a total of 4,000 images were found by police in a subsequent investigation. He emigrated on release, before being kicked out of Cambodia in 2002 amid claims of committing sex crimes. Four years later he was jailed in neighbouring Vietnam for molesting two girls, one aged just ten. He escaped serious charges of child rape — which carried a death sentence — and returned to the  UK in 2008.  Glitter was forced to sign the sex offender register but he was arrested once again in 2012 at his multimillion-pound home in Westminster. Police would later describe him as a “habitual sexual predator who took advantage of the star status afforded to him."" And in 2015 he was convicted of attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault and one of having sex with a girl under 13 in the 1970s and 1980s.

Fuming parents living next to secret bail hostel where Gary Glitter is being held say they fear for their children’s safety after he was released from jail,"A family were horrified to learn freed paedophile Gary Glitter had been moved in next door - forcing them to have a serious discussion with their young children about the dangers of speaking with strangers.The shamed pop star, 78, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was released from prison last week - eight years after he was jailed over child sex offences committed against three schoolgirls.He was moved into a bail hostel in the south of England surrounded by 10 schools - where sources at the facility said he was receiving VIP treatment and kept away from other residents.Father Jonathan Wilson told DorsetLive the community were all feeling 'pretty emotional' when they learned Glitter had been moved in.'This is enemy number one, and they've released them into the community,' he said. 'Our children play in the woods which back onto their property, and we had to tell our kids like, don't talk to them, don't go near anyone there.' Mr Wilson's children are aged three, four and seven.'You'd think these people would be moved in the middle of a field, not where kids are.' After word spread of Glitter's location online, vigilantes arrived within hours, shouting to passing motorists outside the hostel: 'Watch out, Glitter's in there!'One man shook the security gates and tried to scale the fence before four police cars arrived and spoke to the two men and a woman.After being spoken to by officers, one of the protesters told MailOnline: 'People aren't happy that they've put a nonce like Glitter here - there are loads of schools around here.' Glitter has been categorised as a 'level 3' offender.It means he is still seen as 'dangerous' and 'capable of causing serious harm' and will need senior probation staff to monitor him.Any breach of his licence conditions would see Glitter facing an instant return to jail.The shamed pop idol was caged for 16 years in 2015 for sex offences against three girls aged eight to 13.Because he was sentenced to a fixed term, he did not have to go before the Parole Board.Parole chiefs can block a prisoner's release if they believe they still pose a risk to the public.Glitter — was one of the UK's biggest glam rock stars of the 1970s and a familiar face of BBC's TV chart show Top of the Pops. He had a string of hits including three UK No1 singles: I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am!), I Love You Love Me Love and Always Yours.By 1975, he had sold 18million records but by the end of the decade he was declared bankrupt.He made a comeback with his hit single Dance Me Up in 1984.Glitter's dramatic fall from grace began in 1997 when he took a laptop into a Bristol branch of PC World for repair.An engineer found child abuse images on the hard drive.Two years later the singer was jailed for four months after a total of 4,000 images were found by police in a subsequent investigation.Glitter emigrated on release, before being kicked out of Cambodia in 2002 amid claims of sex crimes.Four years later he was jailed in neighbouring Vietnam for molesting two girls, one aged just ten.He escaped serious charges of child rape — which carried a death sentence — and returned to the UK in 2008.He was forced to sign the sex offenders register, but he was arrested once again in 2012 at his multi-million pound home in Westminster.Police would later describe him as a 'habitual sexual predator who took advantage of the star status afforded to him'.And in 2015 he was convicted of attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault and one of having sex with a girl under 13 in the 1970s and 1980s.Sentencing, Judge Alistair McCreath said he could find 'no real evidence' that Glitter had atoned for his crimes.The judge said: 'It is difficult to overstate the depravity of this dreadful behaviour.'He added: 'You did all of them real and lasting damage and you did so for no other reason than to obtain sexual gratification for yourself of a wholly improper kind.'In June 2021 it was revealed Glitter had been given the green light for freedom.One of his child victims in Vietnam — whom he molested when she was just aged ten — said at the time: 'He will always be a terrible danger to young girls.'It's terrifying to think he might soon be free. I still have nightmares about what he did to me.'Glitter no longer owns the master rights to his songs — meaning he no longer receives any royalties.In 2019, his song Rock and Roll Part 2 featured in hit movie The Joker, but rights holders insisted he would not receive any royalties.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11726097/Family-furious-worried-childrens-safety-Gary-Glitter-moved-door.html,

We live in tiny rural town where raunchy Outlander was filmed – rich Americans love it & the area is overrun by tourists,"RESIDENTS of a tiny village where raunchy TV show Outlander was filmed say the area is loved by rich Americans - and overrun by tourists. Culross, a rural town in Fife, Scotland, is home to only 400 people. But since the saucy period drama was filmed there, the village has been inundated by a ""huge number"" of visitors. Rich Americans have even snapped up shares in 600-year-old village pub the Red Lion. The historical drama stars Caitríona Balfe as Claire Randall - a former Second World War military nurse in Scotland. In 1945 she finds herself transported back in time to 1743. There she encounters, falls in love with and marries a dashing Highland warrior named Jamie Fraser, played by Sam Heughan. Red Lion Landlord Mike Brown, 51, said: ""The Outlander cast are in and out of the village quite a lot. ""The village itself dates back to 1510 and there's around 400 people living here. ""We are very busy for tourists - even in December, January, February. ""A lot of shareholders are Americans, they love Outlander. ""We get a lot of people who want to stand at the bar and take photos. ""We are quite a big success story, I don't know why. ""People are coming from all over Britain to ask how we have done it. He added: ""The TV link does help. The tourist interest in Outlander is massive. ""We get a huge amount of tourists all year round."" The Red Lion had previously been at risk after it piled up debt and its owners decided to sell up. But the local community took over the pub before leasing it to Mike, who has worked there for 24 years. He said: ""When it was decided to do the buyout, I was asked if I would be interested in leasing it as I'd worked there 24 years. ""We managed to secure the funding and took over on July 4. ""We raised around £6,000 or £7,000 out of £950,000. ""There's still more to do but we have professional fundraisers on board. ""There's 28 staff and they're all local. We are very busy, there are tour groups coming in four or five times a week. ""There was another pub that closed and became a B&B so we needed to make sure it always remains a pub. ""One of the main things was to keep it open for the community. ""It has been an inn for nearly 600 years. ""What we pay in rent goes back into the community. ""We put it back into the village, whether for seniors or for toddlers, if there's things the council won't pay for. Mike's wife has worked at the Red Lion for decades and his daughter began working there 13 years ago, when she was 14 years old.

Locals buy historic pub in village where Outlander was filmed with the help of American fans of the hit TV programme,"Locals have bought a 400-year-old pub in the village where Outlander was filmed - with American fans of the hit TV show snapping up shares in a desperate bid to protect the area's cinematic heritage.The Red Lion Inn, in Culross, Fife - which dates back to the 17th century- was at risk of closure when previous private owners planned to sell up.Landlord Mike Brown, 51, who has worked there 23 years was approached to see if he would lease it if it was bought by the community.Mike's wife has worked there for decades and his daughter, now a qualified schoolteacher, began working there 13 years ago, when she was 14 years old.A clause in the lease says the building must always remain a pub, which was important to the community after another pub was turned into a B&B however a significant debt needs to be paid off in order to lease. Explaining how the community swooped in, Mike said: 'When it was decided to do the buyout, I was asked if I would be interested in leasing it as I'd worked there 24 years.'We managed to secure the funding and took over on July 4.'There's 28 staff and they're all local.'We are very busy, there are tour groups coming in four or five times a week.'There was another pub that closed and became a B&B so we needed to make sure it always remains a pub.'One of the main things was to keep it open for the community.'It has been an inn for nearly 600 years.'What we pay in rent goes back into the community.'We put it back into the village, whether for seniors or for toddlers, if there's things the council won't pay for.'The pub has been used in scenes of Starz Outlander and has gained an international following due to it.The popular series focuses on the time travel romance of 20th century heroine Claire, who falls through a hole in time to meet 18th century Scotsman Jamie Fraser. Mike continued: 'The Outlander cast are in and out of the village quite a lot. The village itself dates back to 1510 and there's around 400 people living here. 'We are very busy for tourists - even in December, January, February. A lot of shareholders are Americans, they love Outlander.'We get a lot of people who want to stand at the bar and take photos.' Thanks to the pub's reputation amongst local people and fans of the show, the money soon came rolling in and there is hope the building can be saved. Mike explained: 'We raised around £6,000 or £7,000 out of £950,000.'There's still more to do but we have professional fundraisers on board.'At the moment they are looking at creating a hub for people to work from home. We are quite a big success story, I don't know why.'People are coming from all over Britain to ask how we have done it.

"Lidl worker ‘fleeced wealthy pal, 70, out of £284k then killed her and buried body in “murderous” cover-up’","A ""COLD-blooded"" Lidl worker fleeced his wealthy pal out of £284,000 before killing her then burying her body, a court heard. Serkan Kaygusuz, 42, allegedly formed a three-year ""parasitic"" friendship with Norma Girolami, 70, in a bid to take her money. But after she stopped paying him, he killed Norma in a ""cold-blooded"" plot to steal her fortune and £900,000 house in Highgate, North London, it is said. Jurors were told Kaygusuz buried her body then took control of Norma's electronic devices in a bid to trick her family into believing she was still alive. Prosecutor Jocelyn Ledward said: ""Once such immediate practical matters had been dealt with, rather as he had done when Norma Girolami was alive, he set about systematically taking what remained of the money in her bank accounts. ""He did so by taking over her bank and credit card accounts, setting up online banking on them, something which Norma had never done, ordering replacement cards and then beginning the process of syphoning off Norma's money into his own accounts or withdrawing it in cash."" The Old Bailey was told Kaygusuz took out two loans of £35,000 and £25,000 in Norma's name after her death in August 2021. This was on top of the almost £300,000 she had transferred Kaygusuz during their friendship, jurors heard. The pair had become friends after meeting at a local swimming pool in 2017. Norma was said to have been ""flattered"" after the yoinger man made an ""advance"" in the hot tub at the baths. From early 2018, Norma began sending Kaygusuz ever-increasing amounts of cash, it was said. But in May 2021, the ""money tap which had flowed so freely for so long was switched off"", the court was told. Ms Ledward said: ""For a time, the defendant kept asking for money but Ms Girolami stood firm and kept putting him off. ""By August, the defendant must have realised that his comfortable parasitic lifestyle was not going to continue, he was simply not going to get any more out of Ms Girolami. ""At least, not whilst she was alive."" On August 19, 2021, Norma returned to her lavish home following a day out in Leigh-on-Sea. The court was told Kaygusuz was the last person to have any contact with her with telephone records suggesting he went to her home that night. He allegedly killed her then ""concealed"" her body by burying it. Kaygusuz then took control of Norma's mobile and laptop to pretend to her friends and neighbours she was still alive, it was said. Ms Ledward said: ""He had picked his target with care, Norma was relatively well off, and had a long history with the banks she used, who algorithms did not bat a digital eye-lid at the prospect of significant loans to her. ""For about a month after her disappearance, he succeeded. ""But he misjudged the extent to which Norma's friends and cousins cared about Norma, and how well they knew her. ""They were simply not prepared to accept that she had suddenly cut herself off from everyone and everything she knew. ""It is a testament to them that they were not fooled, that they continued to try and to make contact with Norma, and when puzzlement turned to suspicion and fear, they alerted the police to their very grave concerns for their friend."" The court was told after she was reported missing, Kaygusuz ""quickened his pace"" and made transfers and withdrawals almost every day. This, the prosecution say, was to ""get his hands on as much of Norma's money as quickly as possible"". Kaygusuz has admitted dishonestly obtaining her money and property, and concealing and burying her body but denies murder. The trial continues.

"'Parasitic' ex-Lidl worker, 42, 'befriended wealthy woman, 70, by making pass at her in leisure centre hot tub then killed and buried her' after fleecing her of £300,000","A 'parasitic' man befriended a wealthy older woman then killed her and buried the body to plunder her money, a court has heard.Retiree Norma Girolami, 70, gave 42-year-old Serkan Kaygusuz large amounts of cash, totalling nearly £300,000, after they met at a swimming pool in 2017, the Old Bailey was told.The jury heard how she had been 'flattered' after he made an 'advance' in the hot tub at the baths.Over time their relationship became more of a friendship as Kaygusuz allegedly demanded ever-increasing sums of money - four and five-figure sums every few weeks.By May 2021, the 'money tap which had flowed so freely for so long was switched off', prosecutor Jocelyn Ledward told jurors.The reasons were said to have been the death of Ms Girolami's father, her dwindling funds, or that she had 'simply had enough' of jobless Kaygusuz's demands.Mr Ledward said: 'By August, the defendant must have realised that his comfortable parasitic lifestyle was not going to continue: he was simply not going to get any more out of Ms Girolami. At least not whilst she was alive.'On August 19, 2021, Ms Girolami travelled from her £900,000 home in Highgate, north London, for a day out at Leigh-on-Sea, in Essex. She was never seen alive again.The remains of the wealthy Italian were found more than a year later in a graveyard in north London.   Ms Ledward said: 'The prosecution case is that Serkan Kaygusuz murdered her, concealed her body, ultimately by burying it, and then set about getting as much money out of her as he could.'She suggested it was all part of former Lidl supermarket worker Kaygusuz's 'cold-blooded plan'.Jurors were told the plan was carried out 'systematically and with calm and deadly purpose' and born of the 'basest of motives' - to get her money.On the evening after Ms Girolami's trip to the seaside, the defendant is alleged to have gone to her flat and killed her.He allegedly went on to pretend to her friends that she was alive and well while systematically taking what remained of the money in her bank accounts.But Ms Ledward suggested the defendant had underestimated how much Ms Girolami's friends and cousins knew and cared for her.Since Ms Girolami was found dead, the defendant had admitted dishonestly obtaining her money and property, and concealing and burying her body.Divorcee Kaygusuz, of Croach End, north London, has denied murder and the Old Bailey trial continues.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11727129/Lidl-worker-befriended-wealthy-woman-70-killing-stealing-300k.html,

Qatar Airways has launched an internal investigation after a harrowing incident in January nearly resulted in a plane crashing into the ocean. It's been revealed that a Qatar Airways 787 Boeing Dreamliner came within seconds of hitting the waters of the Persian Gulf. The flight took off from Hamad International Airport on January 10 at 2am, bound for Denmark. But recent reports have revealed the first officer in control of the plane lost 1000 feet in elevation within 24 seconds - for no obvious reason. The first officer was reportedly flying manually without directions from the automated ""flight director"". The captain quickly took charge and pulled the aircraft up 800 feet, avoiding disaster.  The first pilot suffered from ""lost situational awareness"", resulting in a quick descent which ""exceeded the flap speed limit"" The aircraft continued its journey to Copenhagen after the terrifying instance. Qatar Airways told MailOnline that the incident was reported to the authorities immediately, and the popular airline released a statement. They said: ""Qatar Airways is aware of an event relating to flight QR161 operating Doha to Copenhagen on January 10, 2023. It was immediately reported to authorities and an internal investigation is being carried out. ""The airline follows the most stringent standards of safety, training and reporting and is working to address any findings in line with industry norms."" The incident has sparked outrage and fear among pilots and passengers alike online. The online forum Aviation Herald has been flooded with comments on the incident, with many concerned about the qualifications of the first pilot who allowed the craft to nosedive. One user said: ""I can’t believe this actually was allowed to happen. This was mere seconds from a complete hull loss. Inexcusable."" Others attributed the incident to Qatar Airline's busy schedules it has in place for its pilots. They said: ""I see many comments jumping directly into fast conclusions about the pilots. ""Qatar Airways have their pilots completely fatigued due to illegal usage of FTL. I've seen rosters up to 158 block hours."" Another simply said: ""In my humble opinion, this should not happen to an IFR rated pilot, private or commercial."" A report in 2021 revealed that Boeing Dreamliners are among the world's safest planes in terms of accidents. There have been no fatalities or events involving extensive damage during more than a decade of flights using the model.

"Morrisons joins Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda in removing best-selling Elf vape bar from sale after Mail investigation revealed £6 gadgets contained illegal level of nicotine","Major retailers have pulled sales of bestselling Elf Bar vapes after a Mail investigation found the company was breaking the law on nicotine limits.Tesco, Sainsbury's, and WH Smith have withdrawn all Elf Bars products and Morrisons and Asda stripped the top ranked Elf Bar 600 range from its shelves.It comes after independent lab tests commissioned by the Mail found the 600 line of e-cigarettes were at least 50 per cent over the legal limit for nicotine e-liquid.Health Secretary Steve Barclay also faced questions in parliament from Tory MP Adam Afriyie over whether he had contacted Trading Standards about the legal breach. Andrew Bush, professor of paediatrics at Imperial College London, had said the Mail expose was 'absolutely shocking' and said it was 'incredibly worrying' that people didn't know what they were taking.It was particularly concerning because, with their bright packaging and sweet flavours, the devices have become popular with children - even though it is illegal to sell vapes to under 18s.More than half of the 11 to 17-year-olds who admitted trying vaping said they used an Elf Bar, around 100,000 young people, anti-smoking group Ash found last year.The Chinese manufacturer, which only launched in 2021, sells 2.5million Elf Bars 600s in the UK every week, accounting for two in three of all disposable vapes. The devices usually sell for around £6 each.The amount of nicotine liquid in a vape is legally limited in the UK to 2ml, of which the maximum nicotine strength should be 2 per cent.The Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016 says the limit was brought in to create 'an environment that protects children from starting to use these products'.But tests commissioned by the Mail on three flavours Elf Bar 600s, bought at Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrisons branches in London, Derby and Sheffield, found they contained between 3ml and 3.2ml of nicotine levels.An Elf Bar spokesman later 'wholeheartedly apologised' and confirmed: 'We found out that some batches of the Elf Bar product have been overfilled in the UK.It appears that e-liquid tank sizes, which are standard in other markets have been inadvertently fitted to some of our UK products.'It added it would alert retailers and review its production process. Elf Bar insisted the 'highly regrettable situation' did not compromise the product's safety.After we shared our findings with the Department of Health, it alerted Trading Standards so they could investigate and 'take the appropriate action'.An Asda spokesman said: 'We can confirm that Asda is removing Elf Bar 600 flavours from sale, while we await the findings of the relevant investigations.'WH Smith said all variants of Elf Bar have been removed from sale in its stores.A Sainsbury's spokesman said: 'We have removed all Elf Bar products from our stores whilst our suppliers investigate this matter further.'A Morrisons spokesman said: 'As part of our ongoing investigation into the legal compliance of Elf Bar 600 disposable electronic cigarettes with Trading Standards, we have made the decision to remove all flavoured variants from sale.'The products will only be returned to sale once stock that fully complies with UK legislation becomes available.'Tesco has temporarily removed all Elf Bar vape lines from the supermarkets and its chain of One Stop stores whilst the manufacturer investigates.Elf Bar also makes the second best selling disposable vape in the UK, the Elf Bar Lost Mary.

"Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s remove vapes from sale over health fears","MAJOR supermarkets have banned the sale of some vapes over health fears.  Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury's have removed the Elf Bar 600 series from sale. The supermarket giants have cleared the e-cig from shelves after they were found to contain 50% more than the legal limit for nicotine e-liquid. The vapes, which would normally cost between £3.80 and £6 at the supermarkets, have been banned following a Daily Mail investigation.  The national limit for nicotine liquid in a vape is currently at 2ml - which equates to a maximum 2% nicotine strength. But tests conducted by the newspaper found they included between 3ml and 3.2ml each. An Elf Bar spokesperson told the paper that some batches have been ""inadvertently"" overfilled in the UK and apologised for the inconvenience.   Sainsbury's told The Sun it has removed all Elf Bar products from stores ""whilst our suppliers investigate this matter further"". Morrisons said it is investigation the issue and has removed all flavours of the e-cig. A Morrisons spokesperson said: ""As part of our ongoing investigation into the legal compliance of Elf Bar 600 disposable electronic cigarettes with Trading Standards, we have made the decision to remove all flavoured variants from sale. ""The products will only be returned to sale once stock that fully complies with UK legislation becomes available.""  Elf Bar and Trading Standards has been contacted for comment. Tesco has also removed some Elf Bar products from sale, the Mail reports. The Sun has approached the supermarket for comment. Elf Bar, a China-based company, sells up to 2.5million Elf Bars 600s every week in the UK, according to the report. Normally, single Elf Bars from the 600 series cost £3.80 from Tesco, £5.99 from Morrisons and £6 from Sainsbury's. We've asked all three supermarkets if they will offer refunds to anyone who has bought the product and will update when we hear back. Shops often offer refunds when items are recalled, but these are usually after official notices from the Food Standards Agency (FSA). Last year Trading Standards officers found the illegal e-cigarettes with nicotine levels twice the UK legal limit being sold in corner shops. The Geek Bar Pro vapes were not authorised to be sold by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Recent data from Action on Smoking (ASH) revealed that the number of kids vaping has increased. The number of children that admitted to trying the products has risen from 14% in 2020 to 16% in 2022. Across the UK, vaping and e-cigarettes come under the same law as smoking. This law states that it's illegal to sell any tobacco products to someone under the age of 18. Recent data from NHS Digital found that kids under the age of nine are being taken to hospital with breathing conditions linked to vaping. In December Waitrose announced it would stop selling single-use vaping products, including two types of e-cigarettes. Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Asda and Co op still sell single-use vapes.

"Family sue school after boy, 7, suffers horrific burns when his sheep outfit catches fire at play","A FAMILY have sued a school after a seven-year-old boy suffered horrific burns when his sheep outfit caught fire at a nativity play. Three years ago, the boy was dressed in a costume made of cotton wool balls when another pupil, holding a lighted candle in a plastic cup, tripped and set fire to the outfit. His parents watched on in horror as the blaze engulfed their son during the carol concert and nativity presentation at Our Lady of the Annunciation Church in Croydon, London, a High Court claim says. Headteacher Noel Campbell and a woman rushed to pat him down to put out the fire, and the child was airlifted to hospital. But he suffered catastrophic burns covering 45 per cent of his body, including his neck, face, body and arms. The boy and his parents accuse the school of negligence and are now suing St Thomas Becket Catholic Primary School for damages of more than £1million.  His mother and father, who were in the audience, claim they suffered psychiatric injuries as a result of witnessing the accident to their son. Both Mr Campbell and the woman were also injured, reports Mail Online. The father is claiming more than £100,000, and his mother over £50,000 for their personal injuries after witnessing the distressing event. They are also seeking provisional damages for their son, allowing them to return to court to seek more money if his condition deteriorates and he develops skeletal or joint deformity, and infection of scar tissue, either spontaneously or caused by surgery. All three are also seeking damages for future disadvantage on the open labour market. Procedural judge Master Brown granted an anonymity order protecting the identities of the boy and his parents meaning they cannot be named. There were around twenty other year 3 children in the corridor near the stage, with each child holding lighted candles in plastic cups, the court will hear. London Fire Brigade’s assistant commissioner for fire safety Dan Daly said: ""This horrific accident is a stark reminder of the risk real candles can pose. ""They are a completely unnecessary hazard when it comes to children and school plays. ""Sadly this isn’t the first time we have seen clothing and costumes set alight by candles and people need to recognise the risk and prevent these incidents from happening again.” The claim was issued by Benjamin Rogers of Stewarts Law. Solicitors Weightmans are acting for the school. St Thomas Becket Catholic Primary School have been contacted for comment.
